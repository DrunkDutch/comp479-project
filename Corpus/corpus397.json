It was developed by Phillips in 1991, based on the  CD-i  format. \n The CD-i Ready format uses a particular technique to get  audio CD  players to skip over the CD-i software and data. CD-i Ready places the software and data in the  pregap  of track 1 (index 0). [1]  Since most  CD players  assume that the pregap area contains only silence, they skip it. Because of this, CD-i Ready was presented as an alternative to CD-i (which stores data in the regular indexes of the first tracks of a disc), which was more compatible with audio CD players. \n The term \" enhanced CD \" is sometimes used to refer to different CD formats that support a mix of audio and data content. Apart from CD-i Ready and CD-i, these formats include  mixed mode CDs  and the  Enhanced Music CD  format. \n ^   Application Note 'CD-i Ready' disc ,  Philips Interactive Media Systems - October 1991 Technical specification of the 'CD-i Ready' type disc. CD-i Ready is an Audio-CD with CD-i data located in the pre-gap before track 1.
