Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\" (for which WGN  radio  and  television  are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the  Chicago metropolitan area  and the  Great Lakes region . It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the  Chicago Tribune ' s parent company purchased the  Los Angeles Times ). [2] \n Traditionally published as a  broadsheet , on January 13, 2009, the  Tribune  announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in  tabloid  format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. [3]  This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the  Tribune  discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. [4] \n The  Tribune ' s masthead is notable for displaying the  American flag , in reference to the paper's motto, \"An American Paper for Americans.\" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag. \n Contents \n 1   History \n 1.1   Beginnings \n 1.2   Medill editorship \n 1.3   Years of McCormick \n 1.4   1948 U.S. presidential election \n 1.5   The Watergate years \n 1.6   1980s and 1990s \n 1.7   2000s \n 1.8   2010s \n 2   Editorial policy \n 3   Tribune Company \n 3.1   Columnists \n 3.1.1   Current \n 3.1.2   Past \n 4   2008 redesign \n 5   Zell ownership and bankruptcy \n 6   Tribune Publishing divestment \n 7   Prices \n 8   See also \n 9   References \n 10   Further reading \n 11   External links \n History [ edit ] \n Beginnings [ edit ] \n The  Tribune  was founded by  James Kelly , John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the  Tribune  was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the  Whig  or  Free Soil  parties against the  Democrats  in elections. [5]  By late 1853, it was frequently running  xenophobic  editorials that criticized foreigners and  Roman Catholics . [6]  About this time it also became a strong proponent of  temperance . [7]  However  nativist  its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the  Tribune  formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or  Know Nothing  party, whose candidate  Levi Boone  was elected  Mayor of Chicago  the following month. [8] \nAn 1870 advertisement for  Chicago Tribune  subscriptions. \n Medill editorship [ edit ] \n By about 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the  Battle of Shiloh , and Dr. Charles H. Ray of  Galena, Illinois , through  Horace Greeley , convinced  Joseph Medill  of  Cleveland 's  Leader  to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and  Alfred Cowles, Sr. , brother of  Edwin Cowles , initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the  Tribune . [9] [10]  Under their leadership, the  Tribune  distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the  Republican Party . [11]  However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive Famine immigration from Ireland. [12] \n The  Tribune  absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the  Free West  in 1855, the  Democratic Press  of  William Bross  in 1858, and the  Chicago Democrat  in 1861, whose editor,  John Wentworth , left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the  Chicago Press & Tribune . On October 25, 1860, it became the  Chicago Daily Tribune . [13]  Before and during the  American Civil War , the new editors strongly supported  Abraham Lincoln , whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an  abolitionist  agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards. \nThe lead editorial in the first issue the  Chicago Tribune  published after the  Great Chicago Fire \n In 1861, the  Tribune  published new lyrics by  William W. Patton  for the song \" John Brown's Body \". These rivaled  the lyrics  published two months later by  Julia Ward Howe . Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the  Great Chicago Fire  of 1871. \n Years of McCormick [ edit ] \n Under the 20th-century editorship of Colonel  Robert R. McCormick , who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly  isolationist  and aligned with the  Old Right  in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto \"The American Paper for Americans\". Through the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the  Democrats  and the  New Deal  of  Franklin D. Roosevelt , was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for  Chiang Kai-shek  and Sen.  Joseph McCarthy . \n When McCormick assumed the position of co-editor (with his cousin  Joseph Medill Patterson ) in 1910, the  Tribune  was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000. [14]  The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as  Little Orphan Annie  and  Moon Mullins . They promoted political \"crusades\", with their first success coming with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen.  William Lorimer . [14]  At the same time, the  Tribune  competed with the Hearst paper, the  Chicago Examiner , in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out Managing Editor William Keeley. By 1918, the  Examiner  was forced to merge with the  Chicago Herald . \n Tribune  in 1919 \n In 1919, Patterson left the  Tribune  and moved to New York to launch his own newspaper, the New York  Daily News . [14]  In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's  Herald-Examiner , McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The  Tribune  won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. Also in 1922, the  Chicago Tribune  hosted an international  design competition  for its new headquarters, the  Tribune Tower . The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a  neo-Gothic  design by New York architects  John Mead Howells  and  Raymond Hood . \n The newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across  Greenland  and  Iceland  in a  Sikorsky  amphibious aircraft. [15]  But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near  Ungava Bay  at the tip of  Labrador ,  Canada . The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship  CSS  Acadia . [16] \n The  Tribune ' s reputation for innovation extended to radio\u2014it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it  WGN (AM) , the station  call letters  standing for the paper's self-description as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper'.  WGN Television  was launched April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remain  Tribune  properties to this day and are among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The  Tribune ' s East Coast sibling, the New York  Daily News , later established  WPIX  television and radio.) \n The  Tribune ' s legendary sports editor  Arch Ward  created the  Major League Baseball All-Star Game  in 1933 as part of the city's  Century of Progress  exposition. \n From 1940 to 1943 the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with  The Chicago Tribune Comic Book , responding to the new success of  comic books . At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer lasting  The Spirit Section , which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium. [17] \n During the McCormick years, the  Tribune  was a champion of  modified spelling  for simplicity (such as spelling \"although\" as \"altho\"). [18] [19]  McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss  Richard J. Daley  was elected mayor for the first time. \n One of the great scoops in  Tribune  history came when it obtained the text of the  Treaty of Versailles  in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the  Pearl Harbor  attack. The  Tribune ' s June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan's naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret. [20]  The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had US President  Franklin D. Roosevelt  so enraged that he considered shutting down the  Tribune . [21] [22] [23] [24] \n 1948 U.S. presidential election [ edit ] \n Truman  was widely expected to lose the 1948 election, and the  Chicago Tribune  ran the incorrect headline, \" Dewey Defeats Truman \". \n The paper is well known for a mistake it made during the  1948 presidential election . At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate  Thomas Dewey  would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried the headline \" Dewey Defeats Truman \", turning the paper into a collector's item. Democrat  Harry S. Truman  won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at  St. Louis Union Station . Beneath the headline was a  false article , written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available. \n The Watergate years [ edit ] \n Colonel McCormick prevented the  Tribune  for years from participating in the  Pulitzer Prize  competition. But it has won 25 of the awards over the years, including many for  editorial writing . [25] [26] [27]  The  Tribune  won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when  Carey Orr  won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter  George Bliss  won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter  Bill Jones  another in 1971 for reporting. [25]  A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter  William Mullen  and photographer  Ovie Carter , who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic  Paul Gapp  won a Pulitzer in 1979. [25] \n In 1969, under the leadership of publisher  Harold Grumhaus  and editor  Clayton Kirkpatrick  (1915\u20132004), the  Tribune ' s began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years. \n In early 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the  Tribune  published the complete 246,000-word text of the  Watergate tapes , in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24\u00a0hours after the transcripts' release by the  Nixon   White House . Not only was the  Tribune  the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the US  Government Printing Office 's published version, and made headlines doing so. [ clarification needed ] \n A week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that \"the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record.\" The  Tribune ' s editors concluded that \"nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,\" and called for Nixon's resignation. The  Tribune  call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon's hopes for survival in office.  The White House  reportedly perceived the  Tribune ' s editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal. \n On December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that  Rick Soll , a \"young and talented columnist\" for the paper, whose work had \"won a following among many  Tribune  readers over the last two years\", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975 column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll's columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point,  Tribune  editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began. [28] \n After leaving, Soll married  Pam Zekman , a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. He worked for the short-lived  Chicago Times  magazine in the late 1980s. \n In January 1977,  Tribune  columnist Will Leonard died at age 64. [29] \n In March 1978, the  Tribune  announced that it hired columnist  Bob Greene  from the  Chicago Sun-Times . [30] \n 1980s and 1990s [ edit ] \n Kirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by  Maxwell McCrohon  (1928\u20132004), who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the  United Press International .  James Squires  served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989. \n Jack Fuller  served as the  Tribune 's editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the  Chicago Tribune .  Howard Tyner  served as the  Tribune 's editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing. \n The  Tribune  won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s. [25]  Editorial cartoonist  Dick Locher  won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist  Jeff MacNelly  won one in 1985. Then, future editor  Jack Fuller  won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988,  Dean Baquet , William Gaines and  Ann Marie Lipinski  won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989,  Lois Wille  won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and  Clarence Page  snagged the award for commentary. In 1994,  Ron Kotulak  won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while  R. Bruce Dold  won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter  Paul Salopek  won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic  Blair Kamin  won it for criticism. [25] \n In September 1981, baseball writer  Jerome Holtzman  was hired by the  Tribune  after a 38-year career at the  Sun-Times . \n In November 1982,  Tribune  managing editor William H. \"Bill\" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with  leukemia . [31] \n In May 1983,  Tribune  columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from  leukemia . [32]  Gold had coauthored the Tribune's \"Inc.\" column with  Michael Sneed  and prior to that had written the paper's \"Tower Ticker\" column. \n The  Tribune  scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist  Mike Royko  away from the rival  Sun-Times . [33] \n In 1986, the  Tribune  announced that celebrated film critic  Gene Siskel , the  Tribune ' s best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a free-lance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague  Roger Ebert  decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show\u2014then known as  At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert  and later known as  Siskel & Ebert & The Movies \u2014from  Tribune Entertainment  to  The Walt Disney Company 's  Buena Vista Television  unit. \"He has done a great job for us,\" editor James Squires said at the time. \"It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that.\" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's  Tribune  bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. [34]  Siskel remained in that free-lance position until his death in 1999. He was replaced as film critic in 1986 by  Dave Kehr . [35] \n In February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after a February 22, 1988 Tribune article written by Broder contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in the  Jerusalem Post . [36] [37] \n In August 1988,  Chicago Tribune  reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from  AIDS . [38] \n In November 1992,  Tribune  associate subject editor Searle \"Ed\" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in  Evanston, Illinois . [39]  Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3\u00a0years in prison. [40] \n In an unusual move at that time, the  Tribune  in October 1993 fired its longtime military-affairs writer, retired-Marine David Evans, with the public position that the post of military affairs was being dropped in favor of having a national security writer. [41] \n In December 1993, the  Tribune ' s longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief,  Nicholas Horrock , was removed from his post after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor  Howard Tyner  requested of him in Chicago. [42]  Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by  James Warren , who attracted new attention to the  Tribune ' s D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington. \n Also in December 1993, the  Tribune  hired  Margaret Holt  from the  South Florida Sun-Sentinel  as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation's 10 largest newspapers. [43]  In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor. [44] \n In 1994, reporter  Brenda You  was fired by the  Tribune  after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the  Tribune ' s photo library. [30]  You later worked for the  National Enquirer  and as a producer for  The Jerry Springer Show  before committing suicide in November 2005. [45] \n In April 1994, the  Tribune ' s new television critic,  Ken Parish Perkins , wrote an article about then- WFLD  morning news anchor  Bob Sirott  in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the  Tribune  later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement. [46]  Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter. [47] \n In December 1995, the alternative newsweekly  Newcity  published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play  The Front Page ) but quickly identified by  Tribune  reporters as that of former  Tribune  reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the  Chicago Reader  that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for  Newcity . [48] \n In 1997, the  Tribune  celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter  Stevenson Swanson  to edit the book  Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City . \n On April 29, 1997, popular columnist  Mike Royko  died of a  brain aneurysm . On September 2, 1997, the  Tribune  promoted longtime City Hall reporter  John Kass  to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist. [49] \n On June 1, 1997, the  Tribune  published what ended up becoming a very popular column by  Mary Schmich  called \"Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young\", otherwise known as \" Wear Sunscreen \" or the \"Sunscreen Speech.\" The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to  Baz Luhrmann . \n In 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the  Tribune  after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter  Don King  for  Emerge  magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the  Chicago Tribune  Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas\u2014and suspend his photographer on the  Emerge  story, Pulitzer Prize-winning  Tribune  photographer Ovie Carter for a month\u2014because Thomas did not tell the  Tribune  about his outside work and also because the  Emerge  story wound up appearing in print first. [50] \n On June 6, 1999, the  Tribune  published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for  Air Zimbabwe  who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on  autopilot  and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door. [51]  An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account \"totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline\" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew, [52]  and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner \"now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.\" [51] \n The  Tribune  has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of  America Online  in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995),  Metromix.com  (1996),  ChicagoSports.com  (1999),  ChicagoBreakingNews.com  (2008), and  ChicagoNow.com  (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as  RedEye . \n 2000s [ edit ] \n Ann Marie Lipinski  was the paper's editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008.  Gerould W. Kern  was named the paper's editor in July 2008. [53]  In early August 2008, managing editor for news  Hanke Gratteau  resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features  James Warren  resigned as well. [54]  Both were replaced by  Jane Hirt , who previously had been the editor of the  Tribune ' s  RedEye  tabloid. [54] \n In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making  The Baltimore Sun  and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune. [55] [56] \n In July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63 just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor. [57] \n Tribune's Baltimore Community papers include  Arbutus Times ,  Baltimore Messenger ,  Catonsville Times ,  Columbia Flier ,  Howard County Times ,  The Jeffersonian ,  Laurel Leader ,  Lifetimes ,  North County News ,  Northeast Booster ,  Northeast Reporter ,  Owings Mills Times , and  Towson Times . \n The  Howard County Times  was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association. [58] \n The  Towson Times  expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics. [59] [60] \n The  Tribune  won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century. [25]  Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the  Tribune  in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team\u2014lead writers of which were  Louise Kiernan ,  Jon Hilkevitch ,  Laurie Cohen ,  Robert Manor , Andrew Martin,  John Schmeltzer , Alex Rodriguez and  Andrew Zajac \u2014won the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system. [25] [61]  In 2003, editorial writer  Cornelia Grumman  snagged the award for editorial writing. [25]  In 2005,  Julia Keller  won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck  Utica, Illinois . [25]  And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including  Patricia Callahan ,  Maurice Possley ,  Sam Roe , Ted Gregory,  Michael Oneal  and  Evan Osnos  won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats. [25] [62] \n In late 2001, sports columnist  Michael Holley  announced he was leaving the  Tribune  after just two months because he was homesick. [63]  He ultimately returned to the  Boston Globe , where he had been working immediately before the  Tribune  had hired him. [63] \n On September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper's longtime columnist,  Bob Greene , resigned effective immediately after acknowledging \"engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column.\" The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. \"Greene's behavior was a serious violation of  Tribune  ethics and standards for its journalists,\" Lipinski wrote. \"We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.\" [64] [65] \n In January 2003,  Mike Downey , formerly of the  Los Angeles Times , was hired as new  Tribune  sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the  In the Wake of the News Column  originated by  Ring Lardner . \n In March 2004, the  Tribune  announced that free-lance reporter  Uli Schmetzer , who retired from the  Tribune  in 2002 after 16\u00a0years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years. [66] \n In May 2004, the  Tribune  revealed that free-lance reporter  Mark Falanga  was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant\u2014namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. \"Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,\" the paper noted. [67] [68]  After the correction, the  Tribune  stopped using Falanga. \n In October 2004,  Tribune  editor  Ann Marie Lipinski  at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper's WomanNews section by free-lance reporter  Lisa Bertagnoli  titled \"You c_nt say that (or can you?),\" about a noted  vulgarism . [69]  The paper ordered every spare body to go to the  Tribune ' s printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the Wednesday, October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the  Tribune . [69] \n In September 2008, the  Tribune  considered hiring controversial sports columnist  Jay Mariotti , shortly after his abrupt resignation from  Tribune  archrival  Chicago Sun-Times . [70]  Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the  Sun-Times  threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009. [70]  Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the  Sun-Times  in December 2009. \n In April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper's marketing department had solicited subscribers' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. \"We'll let the e-mail speak for itself,\" reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as \"a brief market research project.\" [71] \n In the first decade of the 21st century, the  Tribune  had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues: \n In December 2005, the  Tribune  eliminated 28 editorial positions through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, including what were believed to be the first layoffs in the paper's history. [72]  Among the reporters who left the paper in that round were Carol Kleiman, Bill Jauss and Connie Lauerman. [72] \n In June 2007, about 25 newsroom employees took buyouts, including well-known bylines like  Charles Madigan , Michael Hirsley and Ronald Kotulak, along with noted photographer  Pete Souza . [73] \n In March 2008, the paper gave buyouts to about 25 newsroom employees, including sportswriter  Sam Smith . [74] \n On August 15, 2008, the  Tribune  laid-off more than 40 newsroom and other editorial employees, including reporters Rick Popely, Ray Quintanilla,  Lew Freedman , Michael Martinez and Robert Manor. [75] \n Also in August 2008, about 36 editorial employees took voluntary buyouts or resigned, including well-known bylines like Michael Tackett, Ron Silverman, Timothy McNulty, Ed Sherman, Evan Osnos, Steve Franklin, Maurice Possley, Hanke Gratteau, Chuck Osgood and Skip Myslenski. [75] [76] [77] [78] \n On November 12, 2008, five editorial employees in the paper's Washington, D.C. bureau were laid off, including  John Crewdson . [79] \n On December 4, 2008, about 11 newsroom employees were laid-off, with one sports columnist,  Mike Downey , having departed several weeks earlier when his contract was not renewed. Well-known bylines who were laid off included Neil Milbert, Stevenson Swanson, Lisa Anderson, Phil Marty, Charles Storch, Courtney Flynn and Deborah Horan. [80] \n In February 2009, the  Tribune  laid off about 20 editorial employees, including several foreign correspondents, and some feature reporters and editors, although several, including Charles Leroux and Jeff Lyon, technically took buyouts. Among those who were let go were reporters Emily Nunn, Susan Chandler, Christine Spolar and Joel Greenberg. [81] [82] [83] \n On April 22, 2009, the paper laid off 53 newsroom employees, including well-known bylines like Patrick Reardon, Melissa Isaacson, Russell Working, Jo Napolitano, Susan Diesenhouse, Beth Botts, Lou Carlozo, Jessica Reaves, Tom Hundley, Alan Artner, Eric Benderoff, James P. Miller, Bob Sakamoto, Terry Bannon and John Mullin. [84]  That number was less than the 90 newsroom jobs that Crain's Chicago Business previously had reported were to be eliminated. [82] [85] \n The  Tribune  broke the story on Friday, May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school's Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the  Rod Blagojevich  administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called \"Category I\" admissions program, university President B. Joseph \"Joe\" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the  Tribune , in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser  Tony Rezko  to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted. [86] [87]  The  Tribune  has since filed suit against the university administration under the  Freedom of Information Act  to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety. \n 2010s [ edit ] \n On February 8, 2010, the  Chicago Tribune  shrank its newspaper's width by an inch. They said that the new format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal content changes. \n In July 2011, the  Chicago Tribune  underwent its first round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting go about 20 editors and reporters. [88]  Among those let go were DuPage County reporter  Art Barnum , Editorial Board member  Pat Widder  and photographer  Dave Pierini . [88] [89] \n On March 15, 2012, the  Tribune  laid off 15 editorial staffers, including security guard  Wendell Smothers  (Smothers then died on November 12, 2012). [90] [91]  At the same time, the paper gave buyouts to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese. [92] \n In June 2012, the  Tribune ' s Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic  Julia Keller  left the paper to join the faculty of  Ohio University  and to pursue a career as a novelist. [93] \n In September 2012,  Tribune  education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker and City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President  Toni Preckwinkle . [94] \n In September 2012, the  Tribune  hired Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer  John J. Kim  from the  Chicago Sun-Times . [95] \n In October 2012, the  Tribune ' s science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join a public relations firm. [96] \n Also in October 2012, the  Tribune  announced plans to create a pay wall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge. [97] \n In late February 2013, the  Tribune  agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group over unpaid overtime wages. [98]  The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011. [98]  The paper's TribLocal unit had been formed in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news. [98] \n On June 12, 2013, the  Boston Marathon bombings  moving tribute was posted again, which showed the words \"We are Chicago\" above the names of Boston sports teams. [99]  On the graphic on June 12, the word \"Bruins\" was ripped off and the comment was added, \"Yeah, not right now we're not\", in a reference to the  2013 Stanley Cup Finals , which play the  Chicago Blackhawks  against the  Boston Bruins . [99]  Gerould Kern tweeted later that the  Tribune  \"still supports [Boston] after all you've been through. We regret any offense. Now let's play hockey.\" [99] \n On November 20, 2013, the  Tribune  laid off another 12 or so editorial staffers. [100] \n On April 6, 2014, the  Tribune  increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50. [101]  By January 2017 the price increased again, up $1 or 40% at newsracks, to $3.50. At newsstands it went up also $1, or 33.3%, to $3.99. \n On January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor. [102] \n On February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper's editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune's editor. [36] \n Editorial policy [ edit ] \nTribune Tower,  Howells  &  Hood , architects, opened 1925 \n Chicago Tribune  building \n In a 2007 statement of principles published in the  Tribune ' s print and online editions, the paper's editorial board described the newspaper's philosophy, from which is excerpted the following: \n The  Chicago Tribune  believes in the traditional principles of limited government; maximum individual responsibility; minimum restriction of personal liberty, opportunity and enterprise. It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas. \n The  Tribune  brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas. \n The  Tribune  places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The  Tribune  embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region. \n The  Tribune  has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and  entitlement  spending. Although the  Tribune  criticized the Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor  Rod Blagojevich  and  Cook County Board President   Todd Stroger , to task and calling for their removal from office. \n In 2004, the  Tribune  endorsed President  George W. Bush  for re-election, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the  Republican Party . In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator  Barack Obama \u2014the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president. [103]  The  Tribune  endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012. [104] \n The  Tribune  has previously backed independent candidates. In 1872, it supported  Horace Greeley , a former Republican Party newspaper editor, [105]  and in 1912 the paper endorsed  Theodore Roosevelt , who ran on the  Progressive Party  slate against Republican President  William Howard Taft . \n Over the years, the  Tribune  has endorsed Democrats for lesser offices, including recent endorsements of  Bill Foster , Barack Obama for the  Senate  and Democrat  Melissa Bean , who defeated  Philip Crane , the  House of Representatives ' longest-serving Republican. Though the  Tribune  endorsed  George Ryan  in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal. \n In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the  Libertarian Party  candidate, former New Mexico Governor  Gary Johnson  for president, over Republican  Donald Trump  and Democrat  Hillary Clinton . [106] \n Tribune Company [ edit ] \n Main article:  Tribune Media Company \n The  Chicago Tribune  is the founding business unit of  Tribune Company  (since renamed  Tribune Media Company ), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owns the  WGN  radio station (720\u00a0AM) and  WGN-TV  (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the  Los Angeles Times \u2014which displaced the Tribune as the company's largest property\u2014and the  Chicago Cubs   baseball  team. The Cubs were sold in 2009, the newspapers spun off in 2014. \n Tribune Company owned the New York  Daily News  from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate  Robert Maxwell . The founder of the  News , Capt.  Joseph Medill Patterson , was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of  Tribune  editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of  simplified spelling , another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper  Newsday \u2014founded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter (and Medill's great-granddaughter),  Alicia Patterson \u2014to Long Island cable TV company  Cablevision . \n Since 1925, the  Chicago Tribune  has been housed in the  Tribune Tower  on North  Michigan Avenue  on the  Magnificent Mile . The building is  neo-Gothic  in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the  Tribune . The Tribune Tower is owned by Tribune Media. Tribune Tower once housed the physical storefront of the Chicago Tribune Store, but more recently the store has switched to an online presence. [107] \n Columnists [ edit ] \n Current [ edit ] \n Amy Dickinson \n David Haugh \n Blair Kamin \n John Kass \n Clarence Page \n Michael Phillips \n Phil Rosenthal \n Mary Schmich \n Eric Zorn \n Melissa Harris \n Past [ edit ] \n William Armstrong \n Skip Bayless \n Claudia Cassidy \n Steve Daley \n Mike Downey \n Bob Greene \n Vernon Jarrett \n Hugh Keough \n Ann Landers \n Ring Lardner \n Charles Madigan \n Steve Neal \n Jack Mabley \n Mike Royko \n Gene Siskel \n Arch Ward \n 2008 redesign [ edit ] \n The September 2008 redesign (discussed here [108]  on the  Tribune 's web site) was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting. [109]  Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style. \n Zell ownership and bankruptcy [ edit ] \n In December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate  Sam Zell  in an $8.2\u00a0billion deal. Zell was the company's new chairman. [110]  A year after going private, following a $124\u00a0million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13\u00a0billion and assets of $7.6\u00a0billion. [111] \n As part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor  Rod Blagojevich . Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired. [112] \n In the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a \"fraudulent transfer\" of wealth. [113] \n The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock. [114]  Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company, [114] [115]  the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500\u00a0million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company. [116] \n The Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company's plan included selling off many of its assets. [116] \n Tribune Publishing divestment [ edit ] \n Tribune Publishing , owning the  Chicago Tribune ,  Los Angeles Times , and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed  Tribune Media Company . [117]  Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017. [117] [118] \n Spinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%. [118]  Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties. [117] \n Prices [ edit ] \n The  Tribune  prices are: $1.50 or $1.99/Daily, $3.50 or $3.99/Sunday/Thanksgiving Day. The  Tribune  on weekdays was $1.50 until early 2017, the current newsrack price, when it was raised to $1.99. Price is higher outside Cook & adjacent counties.
