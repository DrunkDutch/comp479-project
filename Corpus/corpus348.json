Run a system disk scan in the Norton Antivirus suite. For instance Norton has a tool called \"Windoctor\" that makes repairs automatically. It is suggested that if you remove Norton for another free antivirus program, they retain Norton Utilities/ WinDoctor and Speed Disk for defragging.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c2\\/Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c2\\/Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 2 \n Always run a scan on anything you download before you open it.  Remove programs that you don't use or need. Too many programs clog up the machine. Do periodic defragging. Anytime you download or remove programs, music, etc. plus the normal creation of files, it fragments the computer and slows and confuses its proper functions. \"When system files are overwritten, such as .sys, .dll, .ocx, .ttf, .fon, and .exe files, system performance becomes unpredictable, programs behave erratically, and the operating system fails\".\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e0\\/Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e0\\/Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Restore-DLL-Files-on-Your-Computer-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n If it is determined that if you have one or more missing DLL files, that can be identified, and they can be replaced.
