Check minimum admission requirements \n For the degree you are seeking: \n Canadian and international students \u00a0applying to Doctorate (PhD), Master\u2019s degree, Diploma, or Certificate programs \n Or , for your specific situation: \n Visiting students  \u2013 to enrol in a course(s) that counts towards a degree at another institution \u00a0 \n Independent students \u00a0\u2013 to enrol in graduate course(s) without seeking a degree \n 2. Check program-specific requirements \n You may need to submit additional forms, documents, portfolio, test scores, with your application, or secure a supervisor before you apply. Be sure to review the additional requirements specific to your\u00a0 program . \n The earlier you submit all required documents, the sooner Concordia can begin processing your application. During peak seasons, it may take several weeks to include hard copies of your documents to your file. \n 3. Check language requirements \n Determine if you must include proof of English proficiency with your application. \n Check our\u00a0 English language proficiency requirements . \n 4. Gather supporting documents \n During the application process, you will be asked to submit electronic copies of your supporting documents (including unofficial transcripts and test scores). Submit each document only once. If Concordia requires you to mail official documents, we will notify you. You can always upload documents after your application has been submitted. \n Documents you may need to include: \n Transcripts and Certificates\r\n Please upload  unofficial copies of transcripts , from all previous educational institutions, when you apply to Concordia because it speeds up the review of your application. \n If you are  currently enrolled in school : \n Submit the results of previous terms and a list of your current courses \n Include mid-year grades if they're available \n Uploaded transcripts, however, are not official transcripts.  Official transcripts  are documents sent directly from an institution to our Admissions Application Centre.  Unless otherwise specified, we request official transcripts only once you are admitted . \n Where to mail official transcripts (if we request them) : \n If you studied at institutions  in Canada or the United States  you can submit official transcripts in a sealed envelope. \n If you studied  outside of Canada or the United States , you must arrange to have your school mail an official transcript. \n In both cases, you must  send transcripts   directly to the Graduate Admission Application Centre. \n By mail: \n Concordia University \n Graduate Admissions \n Application Centre \n P.O.

After this time, candidates who wish to make a future application, will be required to submit updated letters of reference. \n Most departments require  three letters of reference . A suitable referee is an individual who is well-acquainted with your education and abilities. Referees should be academic in nature where possible. Professional referees will be accepted in situations where the applicant\u2019s experience is most relevant. You will need to supply the names of your referees in the online application. \n Academic Assessment forms \u00a0can be downloaded and given to your referees. \n Each  letter of reference and accompanying Academic Assessment form must be sent in a signed, sealed envelope (signed across the flap of the envelope). \n You can ask your referees to send them directly to the address below. \n Referees from a North American institution may send their official letter of reference directly to the  Graduate Program Assistant  in the prospective student\u2019s department. In order for the letters of reference to be considered official, referees must ensure that the letters of reference are emailed directly from their personal university email address. \n By mail: \n Concordia University \n Graduate Admissions \n Application Centre \n P.O.
