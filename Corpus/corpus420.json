Copyleft-style licensors seek \"continuous growth of a universally accessible technology commons\" from which they, and others, will benefit. [1] [2] \n Patentleft  is analogous to  copyleft , a license which allows distribution of a  copyrighted  work and derived works, but only under the same terms. \n Contents \n 1   Uses \n 2   Example \n 3   See also \n 4   References \n 5   Further reading \n 6   External links \n Uses [ edit ] \n The  Biological Innovation for Open Society  (BiOS) project implemented a patentleft system to encourage re-contribution and collaborative innovation of their technology. BiOS holds a patented technology for transferring genes in plants, and licenses the technology under the terms that, if a license holder improves the gene transfer tool and patents the improvement, then their improvement must be made available to all the other license holders. [3] \n The open patent idea is designed to be practiced by  consortia  of research-oriented companies [4]  and increasingly by  standards bodies . These also commonly use  open trademark  methods to ensure some compliance with a suite of compatibility tests, e.g.  Java ,  X/Open  both of which forbid use of the mark by the non-compliant. [ citation needed ] \n On October 12, 2001 the  Free Software Foundation  and Finite State Machine Labs Inc. (FSMLabs) announced a  GPL  - compliant open-patent license for FSMLabs'  software patent ,  US 5995745 \u00a0 . Titled the Open RTLinux patent license Version 2, it provides for usage of this patent in accordance with the GPL. [5] \n Example [ edit ] \n Person A has a patent, and licenses it under a patentleft license. \n Person B has two patents in her product and wants to use Person A's patents in that product. Person B also wants to charge royalties for her two patents. She decides to use Person A's patent, but now must license her patents, royalty-free, under the same terms as Person A's patent. \n Person C has three patents in his product and wants to use Person B's two patents in that product, but doesn't want to use Person A's patent. Person C also wants to charge royalties for his three patents. He decides to use Person B's patent, but now must license his patents, royalty-free, under the same terms as Person A's patent. \n See also [ edit ] \n Copyleft \n Patent troll \n Public domain \n Software patent \n Viral license \n Open content \n Open Invention Network \n Open Patent Alliance \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Hope, Janet (2008).
