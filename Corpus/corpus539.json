It was established in 1901 and was known by this name until 2010 (except for a brief period during the One Unit program of West Pakistan) The area became  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Province on April 19, 2010 when the Eighteenth Amendment was signed by President Asif Ali Zardari. \n The province covered an area of 70,709\u00a0km\u00b2, including much of the current Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but excluding the  princely states  of  Amb ,  Chitral ,  Dir ,  Phulra  and  Swat . The capital was the city of  Peshawar  and the province was composed of three divisions ( Peshawar ,  Dera Ismail Khan  and  Malakand ). Until 1947 the province was bordered by five princely states to the north, the minor states of the  Gilgit Agency  to the northeast, the province of  West Punjab  to the east, and the province of  Balochistan  to the south. Afghanistan lay to the northwest, with the tribal agencies forming a buffer zone. \n Contents \n 1   History \n 2   Demographics \n 3   Government \n 4   See also \n 5   References \n 6   External links \n History [ edit ] \n Most of the territory of this province was part of the  Durrani Empire  from the 18th century to around the 1820s, when the  Sikh  ruler or  Maharaja   Ranjit Singh , the former mayor of the Punjabi city of  Lahore , taking advantage of the internal chaos of the Afghan ruling family, declared independence and annexed it to his own empire based out of the Punjab. \n Later on, after the  Second Anglo-Sikh War  of 1848-1849, when the Punjab came under the control of British East India Company, this region along with the 'Frontier Tribal Areas' acted as a 'buffer' zone with Afghanistan. The Province was formally created in 1901 by the British administration, out of the North-Westerly areas of the originally  Pashtun  lands which were merged with old Punjab, initially under a  Chief Commissioner , and then a full-fledged Governor beginning circa 1938. \n At the  Partition of India , a referendum was held to decide the future of NWFP. Following a boycott of the vote by  Bacha Khan  and the  Khudai Khidmatgars , the NWFP became part of the new nation of  Pakistan . The province lasted until 1955 when it was merged into the new province of  West Pakistan , under the  One Unit  policy announced by  Prime Minister   Chaudhry Mohammad Ali .  Mianwali  and  Attock  were removed from it and merged with  Punjab . It was recreated after the dissolution of the One Unit system and lasted under its old nomenclature until April 2010, when it was renamed as the ' Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ' province. \n Demographics [ edit ] \n At independence there was a clear Muslim Pashtun majority in then North-West Frontier Province, although there were some small minorities of Hindus and Sikhs. The languages of the North-West Frontier Province included Pashto, Hindko, Kohistani and others, although most of the population spoke  Pashto . Prior to the arrival of the British, the  official language , for governmental uses and such, was Persian. \n Government [ edit ] \n The offices of  Governor  and  Chief Minister  of the North-West Frontier Province lasted until 14 October 1955. \n Tenure \n Governors of the North-West Frontier Province  [1] \n 14 August 1947 \u2013 8 April 1948 \n Sir George Cunningham \n 8 April 1948 \u2013 16 July 1949 \n Sir Ambrose Dundas Flux Dundas \n 16 July 1949 \u2013 14 January 1950 \n Sahibzada Mohammad Kursheed \n 14 January 1950 \u2013 21 February 1950 \n Mohammad Ibrahim Khan Jhagra  (acting) \n 21 February 1950 \u2013 23 November 1951 \n Ismail Ibrahim Chundrigar \n 24 November 1951 \u2013 17 November 1954 \n Khwaja Shahabuddin \n 17 November 1954 \u2013 14 October 1955 \n Qurban Ali Khan \n 14 October 1955 \n North-West Frontier Province dissolved \n Tenure \n Chief Ministers of the North-West Frontier Province  [1] \n Political Party \n 1 April 1937 \u2013 7 September 1937 \n Sir  Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum Khan \n Non-Party Government Nominee \n 7 September 1937 \u2013 10 November 1939 \n Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan  (1st time) \n Indian National Congress \n 10 November 1939 \u2013 25 May 1943 \n Governor's rule \n 25 May 1943 \u2013 16 March 1945 \n Sardar Aurangzeb Khan \n Muslim League \n 16 March 1945 \u2013 22 August 1947 \n Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan  (2nd time) \n Indian National Congress \n 14 August 1947 \n Independence of Pakistan \n 23 August 1947 \u2013 23 April 1953 \n Khan  Abdul Qayyum Khan \n Pakistan Muslim League \n 23 April 1953 \u2013 18 July 1955 \n Sardar Abdur Rashid Khan \n 19 July 1955 \u2013 14 October 1955 \n Sardar Bahadur Khan \n See also [ edit ] \n Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \n Federally Administered Tribal Areas \n References [ edit ] \n ^  a   b   Ben Cahoon, WorldStatesmen.org.  \"Pakistan Provinces\" .
