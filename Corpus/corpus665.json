With a visual  apparent magnitude  of \u22121.46, it is almost twice as bright as  Canopus , the next brightest star. The system has the  Bayer designation   Alpha   Canis Majoris  (\u03b1 CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is a  binary star  system, consisting of a white  main-sequence  star of  spectral type  A0 or A1, termed  Sirius A , and a faint  white dwarf  companion of spectral type DA2, called  Sirius B . The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.2 and 31.5  AU . [24] \n Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic  luminosity  and its proximity to  Earth . At a distance of 2.6  parsecs  (8.6  ly ), as determined by the  Hipparcos  astrometry satellite, [2] [25] [26]  the Sirius system is one of Earth's  near neighbours . Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years. [27] \n Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun ( M \u2609 ) and has an  absolute visual magnitude  of 1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun [12]  but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or  Rigel . The system is between 200 and  300 million  years old. [12]  It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a  red giant  before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a  white dwarf  around  120 million  years ago. [12] \n Sirius is also known colloquially as the \" Dog Star \", reflecting its prominence in its  constellation ,  Canis Major  (Greater Dog). [18]  The  heliacal rising  of Sirius marked the flooding of the  Nile  in  Ancient Egypt  and the \" dog days \" of summer for the  ancient Greeks , while to the  Polynesians  in the  Southern Hemisphere  the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the  Pacific Ocean . \n Contents \n 1   Observational history \n 1.1   Kinematics \n 1.2   Distance \n 1.3   Discovery of a companion \n 1.4   Colour controversy \n 2   Visibility \n 3   System \n 3.1   Sirius A \n 3.2   Sirius B \n 3.3   Sirius star cluster \n 4   Etymology and cultural significance \n 4.1   Dogon \n 4.2   Serer religion \n 4.3   Modern significance \n 5   See also \n 6   Notes \n 7   References \n 7.1   Citations \n 7.2   Bibliography \n 8   External links \n Observational history [ edit ] \n Sirius \n Spdt \nin  hieroglyphs \n Sirius  ( bottom ) and the  Orion constellation  ( right ). Together, the three brightest stars of the northern winter sky\u2014Sirius,  Betelgeuse  ( top right ), and  Procyon  ( top left )\u2014can also be understood as forming the  Winter Triangle . \n The brightest star in the night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days [28]  before returning to the night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the  ecliptic  causes this  heliacal rising  to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the  solar year . This occurs at  Cairo  on 19 \u00a0 July ( Julian ), placing it just prior to the  summer solstice  and the onset of the  annual flooding  of the  Nile  during antiquity. [29] \n Owing to the flood's own irregularity, the extreme precision of the star's return made it important to the  ancient Egyptians , [29]  who worshipped it as the  goddess   Sopdet  ( Egyptian :  Spdt , \"Triangle\"; [a]   Greek :  \u03a3\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9\u03c2 ,  S\u014d\u0302this ), guarantor of the fertility of their land. [b]  The  Egyptian civil calendar  was apparently initiated to have its New Year \u201c Mesori \u201d coincide with the appearance of Sirius, although its lack of  leap years  meant that this congruence only held for four years until its date began to wander backwards through the months. The Egyptians continued to note the times of Sirius's annual return, which may have led them to the discovery of the 1460-year  Sothic cycle  and influenced the development of the  Julian  and  Alexandrian calendars . \n The ancient Greeks observed that the appearance of Sirius heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that it caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused. [30]  Due to its brightness, Sirius would have been noted to  twinkle  more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified certain emanations which caused its malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects was said to be \"star-struck\" ( \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ,  astrob\u00f3l\u0113tos ). It was described as \"burning\" or \"flaming\" in literature. [31]  The season following the star's reappearance came to be known as the  dog days . [32]  The inhabitants of the island of  Ceos  in the  Aegean Sea  would offer sacrifices to Sirius and  Zeus  to bring cooling breezes, and would await the reappearance of the star in summer. If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius' importance. [31]  The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around April 25, sacrificing a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess  Robigo  so that the star's emanations would not cause  wheat rust  on wheat crops that year. [33] \n Ptolemy  of Alexandria mapped the stars in Books\u00a0VII and VIII of his  Almagest , in which he used Sirius as the location for the globe's central meridian. He depicted it as one of six red-coloured stars (see the  Colour controversy  section below). The other five are class M and K stars, such as  Arcturus  and  Betelgeuse . [34] \n Bright stars were important to the ancient  Polynesians  for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of  Fiji  at 17\u00b0S and thus passes directly over the islands each night. [35]  Sirius served as the body of a \"Great Bird\" constellation called  Manu , with  Canopus  as the southern wingtip and  Procyon  the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. [36]  Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the  M\u0101ori , whose name  Takurua  described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the  winter solstice  was marked by celebration in  Hawaii , where it was known as  Ka'ulua , \"Queen of Heaven\". Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including  Tau-ua  in the  Marquesas Islands ,  Rehua  in New Zealand, and  Ta'urua-fau-papa  \"Festivity of original high chiefs\" and  Ta'urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai  \"Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies\" in Tahiti. [37]  The  Hawaiian people  had many names for Sirius, including  Aa  (\"glowing\"), [38]   Hoku-kauopae , [39]   Kau-ano-meha  (also  Kaulanomeha ), \"Standing-alone-and-sacred\", [39] [40]   Hiki-kauelia  or  Hiki-kauilia  (the navigational name),  Hiki-kau-lono-meha  (\"star of solitary Lono\", the astrological name), [41]   Kaulua  (also  Kaulua-ihai-mohai , \"flower of the heavens\"), [42]   Hiki-kauelia ,  Hoku-hoo-kele-waa  (\"star which causes the canoe to sail\", a marine navigation name), [43]  and  Kaulua-lena  (\"yellow star\"). [42]  The people of the  Society Islands  called Sirius variously  Taurua-fau-papa ,  Taurua-nui-te-amo-aha , and  Taurua-e-hiti-i-tara-te-feiai . Other names for Sirius included  Palolo-mua  ( Futuna ),  Mere  ( Mangaia ),  Apura  ( Manihiki ),  Taku-ua  ( Marquesas Islands ), and  Tokiva  ( Pukapuka ). [39]  In the cosmology of the  Tuamotus , Sirius had various names, including  Takurua-te-upuupu , [39]   Te Kaha  (\"coconut fibre\"), [44]   Te Upuupu , [45]   Taranga , [46]  and  Vero-ma-torutoru  (\"flaming and diminishing\"). [47] \n The indigenous  Boorong  people of northwestern Victoria named Sirius as  Warepil . [48] \n Kinematics [ edit ] \n In 1718,  Edmond Halley  discovered the  proper motion  of the hitherto presumed \"fixed\" stars [49]  after comparing contemporary  astrometric  measurements with those given in Ptolemy's  Almagest . The bright stars  Aldebaran ,  Arcturus  and Sirius were noted to have moved significantly; Sirius had progressed 30  arc minutes  (about the diameter of the Moon) southwards in 1,800 years. [50] \n In 1868, Sirius became the first star to have its velocity measured, the beginning of the study of celestial  radial velocities . Sir  William Huggins  examined the spectrum of the star and observed a  red shift . He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40\u00a0km/s. [51] [52]  Compared to the modern value of \u22125.5\u00a0km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun. \n Distance [ edit ] \n In his 1698 book  Cosmotheoros ,  Christiaan Huygens  estimated the distance to Sirius at 27664 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun (about 0.437 light years, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5 arcseconds). [53]  There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the  parallax  of Sirius: by  Jacques Cassini  (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including  Nevil Maskelyne ) [54]  using  Lacaille 's observations made at the  Cape of Good Hope  (4 seconds); by  Piazzi  (the same amount); using  Lacaille 's observations made at  Paris , more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape (no sensible parallax); by  Bessel  (no sensible parallax). [55] \n Scottish astronomer  Thomas Henderson  was the first to gain some meaningful value using his observations made in 1832\u20131833 and South African astronomer  Thomas Maclear 's observations made in 1836\u20131837, and was published in 1839. The value of the parallax was 0.23  arcseconds , and error of the parallax was estimated not to exceed a quarter of a second, or in Henderson's words, \"On the whole we may conclude that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than half a second in space; and that it is probably much less.\" [56]  Astronomers adopted a value of 0.25 arcseconds for much of the 19th century. [57]  It is now known to have a parallax of  0.3792 \u00b1 0.0016  arcseconds and therefore a distance of  1/0.3792 \u2245 2.637  parsecs, showing Henderson's measurement to be accurate. \n Discovery of a companion [ edit ] \nA simulated image of Sirius A and B using  Celestia \n In 1844, the German astronomer  Friedrich Bessel  deduced from changes in the proper motion of Sirius that it had an unseen companion. [58]  On January 31, 1862, American telescope-maker and astronomer  Alvan Graham Clark  first observed the faint companion, which is now called Sirius B, or affectionately \"the Pup\". [59]  This happened during testing of an 18.5-inch (470\u00a0mm) aperture  great refractor  telescope for  Dearborn Observatory , which was the largest refracting telescope lens in existence at the time, and the largest telescope in the United States. [60]  Sirius B's sighting was confirmed on March 8 with smaller telescopes. [61] \n The visible star is now sometimes known as Sirius A. Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in the Sirius system have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been confirmed. The best fit to the data indicates a six-year orbit around Sirius A and a mass of 0.06\u00a0M \u2609 . This star would be five to ten magnitudes fainter than the white dwarf Sirius\u00a0B, which would make it difficult to observe. [62]  Observations published in 2008 were unable to detect either a third star or a planet. An apparent \"third star\" observed in the 1920s is now believed to be a background object. [63] \n In 1915,  Walter Sydney Adams , using a 60-inch (1.5\u00a0m) reflector at  Mount Wilson Observatory , observed the  spectrum  of Sirius B and determined that it was a faint whitish star. [64]  This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf, the second to be discovered. [65]  The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by  Robert Hanbury Brown  and  Richard Q. Twiss  in 1959 at  Jodrell Bank  using their stellar  intensity interferometer . [66]  In 2005, using the  Hubble Space Telescope , astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, 12,000 kilometres (7,500\u00a0mi), with a mass 102% of the Sun's. [67] \n Colour controversy [ edit ] \n Around AD 150, the Greek astronomer of the Roman period  Claudius Ptolemy  described Sirius as reddish, along with five other stars,  Betelgeuse ,  Antares ,  Aldebaran ,  Arcturus  and  Pollux , all of which are of orange or red hue. [68]  The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer  Thomas Barker , squire of  Lyndon Hall  in  Rutland , who prepared a paper and spoke at a meeting of the  Royal Society  in London in 1760. [69]  The existence of other stars changing in brightness gave credence to the idea that some may change in colour too;  Sir John Herschel  noted this in 1839, possibly influenced by witnessing  Eta Carinae  two years earlier. [70]   Thomas Jefferson Jackson See  resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892, and a final summary in 1926. [71]  He cited not only Ptolemy but also the poet  Aratus , the orator  Cicero , and general  Germanicus  as calling the star red, though acknowledging that none of the latter three authors were astronomers, the last two merely translating Aratus' poem  Phaenomena . [72]   Seneca  had described Sirius as being of a deeper red than Mars. [73]  Not all ancient observers saw Sirius as red. The 1st-century poet  Marcus Manilius  described it as \"sea-blue\", as did the 4th century  Avienus . [74]  It was the standard white star in ancient China, and multiple records from the 2nd century BC up to the 7th century AD all describe Sirius as white. [75] [76] \n In 1985, German astronomers Wolfhard Schlosser and Werner Bergmann published an account of an 8th-century  Lombardic  manuscript, which contains  De cursu stellarum ratio  by St.  Gregory of Tours . The Latin text taught readers how to determine the times of nighttime prayers from positions of the stars, and Sirius is described within as  rubeola \u00a0\u2014 \"reddish\". The authors proposed this was further evidence Sirius B had been a red giant at the time. [77]  Other scholars replied that it was likely St. Gregory had been referring to Arcturus. [78] [79] \n The possibility that  stellar evolution  of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be responsible for this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. [73]  An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. [80]  Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic  scintillations  of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon. [73] \n Visibility [ edit ] \nThe image of Sirius A and Sirius B taken by the  Hubble Space Telescope . The white dwarf can be seen to the lower left. [81]  The  diffraction spikes  and concentric rings are  instrumental effects . \n With an  apparent magnitude  of \u22121.46, Sirius is the brightest star system in the night sky, almost twice the brightness of the second brightest star,  Canopus . [82]  It is not as bright as the  Moon ,  Venus , or  Jupiter ; at times,  Mercury  and  Mars  are also brighter than Sirius. [83]  Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only  observers north of 73 degrees  latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13\u00b0 above the horizon from  Saint Petersburg . [84]  Sirius, along with  Procyon  and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three  vertices  of the  Winter Triangle  to observers in the  Northern Hemisphere . [85]  Due to its  declination  of roughly \u221217\u00b0, Sirius is a  circumpolar star  from latitudes south of 73\u00b0 S. From the  Southern Hemisphere  in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. [86]  Due to  precession  (and slight  proper motion ), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be \u221267\u00b0 and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia. \n Sirius can be observed in daylight with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. [87]  These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius. \n The orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3\u00a0 arcseconds  and a maximum of 11\u00a0arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A  periastron  occurred in 1994 [c]  and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope. [88] \n At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6\u00a0ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight  nearest stars  to the  Solar System  (not including the Sun), [89]  and is the fifth closest stellar system to ours (again not including the Sun). [89]  This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as  Alpha Centauri  and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as Canopus, Rigel or Betelgeuse. [90]  It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun. [12]  The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is Procyon, 1.61 parsecs (5.24\u00a0ly) away. [91]  The  Voyager 2  spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four  Jovian planets  in the Solar System, is expected to pass within 4.3 light-years (1.3\u00a0pc) of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years.

The bright source is Sirius B. Credit: NASA/SAO/CXC. \n Sirius is a binary star system consisting of two white stars orbiting each other with a separation of about 20 AU [d]  (roughly the distance between the Sun and  Uranus ) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a  main-sequence  star of  spectral type  early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940\u00a0 K . [13]  Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. [93]  The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. [93]  The system emits a  higher than expected level of infrared radiation , as measured by  IRAS  space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. [91] [94]  The  Chandra X-ray Observatory  image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source. [95] \n In 2015, Vigan and colleagues used the  VLT Survey Telescope  to search for evidence of substellar companions, and were able to rule out the presence of giant planets 11 times more massive than Jupiter at 0.5 au distance from Sirius A, 6\u20137 times the mass of Jupiter at 1\u20132 au distance, and down to around 4 times the mass of Jupiter at 10 au distance. [96] \n Sirius A [ edit ] \nAn artist's impression of Sirius A and Sirius B. Sirius A is the larger of the two stars. \nComparison of Sirius A and Sun (to scale) \n Sirius A has a mass of 2\u00a0M \u2609 . [11] [12] [97]  The radius of this star has been measured by an  astronomical interferometer , giving an estimated angular diameter of 5.936\u00b10.016\u00a0 mas . The  projected rotational velocity  is a relatively low 16\u00a0km/s, [15]  which does not produce any significant flattening of its disk. [98]  This is at marked variance with the similar-sized  Vega , which rotates at a much faster 274\u00a0km/s and bulges prominently around its equator. [99]  A weak  magnetic field  has been detected on the surface of Sirius A. [100] \n Stellar models suggest that the star formed during the collapsing of a  molecular cloud , and that after  10 million  years, its internal energy generation was derived entirely from nuclear reactions. The core became  convective  and used the  CNO cycle  for energy generation. [98]  It is predicted that Sirius A will have completely exhausted the store of hydrogen at its core within a billion (10 9 ) years of its formation. At this point it will pass through a  red giant  stage, then settle down to become a white dwarf. \n Sirius A is classed as an  Am star  because the spectrum shows deep metallic  absorption lines , [101]  indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron. [91] [98]  The spectral type has been reported as A0mA1 Va, which indicates that it would be classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am stars. [7]  When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by  \n [ \n Fe \n H \n ] \n = \n 0.5 \n {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\left[{\\frac {\\ce {Fe}}{\\ce {H}}}\\right]=0.5} \n , [14]  which is equivalent to 10 0.5 , meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to be true of the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface. [98] \n Sirius B [ edit ] \nThe orbit of Sirius B around A as seen from Earth (slanted ellipse). The wide horizontal ellipse shows the true shape of the orbit (with an arbitrary orientation) as it would appear if viewed straight on. \n With a mass nearly equal to the Sun's, Sirius B is one of the more massive  white dwarfs  known (1.02\u00a0M \u2609 ); it is almost double the 0.5\u20130.6\u00a0M \u2609  average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth's. [67]  The current surface temperature is 25,200\u00a0K. [12]  Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over more than two billion years. [102] \n A white dwarf forms only after the star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a red-giant stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, around 120 million years ago. The original star had an estimated 5\u00a0M \u2609 [12]  and was a  B-type star  (roughly B4\u20135) [103] [104]  when it was still on the main sequence. While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius B may have enriched the  metallicity  of its companion. \n This star is primarily composed of a carbon\u2013oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star. [12]  This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity. [105]  The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen\u2014the element with the lowest mass\u2014and no other elements are seen in its spectrum. [106] \n Sirius star cluster [ edit ] \n In 1909,  Ejnar Hertzsprung  was the first to suggest that Sirius was a member of the  Ursa Major Moving Group , based on his observations of the system's movements across the sky. The Ursa Major Group is a set of 220 stars that share a common motion through space and were once formed as members of an  open cluster , which has since become gravitationally unbound. [107]  Analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius's membership in the group to be questionable: the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500\u00b1100\u00a0million years, whereas Sirius, with metallicity similar to the Sun's, has an age that is only half this, making it too young to belong to the group. [12] [108] [109]  Sirius may instead be a member of the proposed Sirius Supercluster, along with other scattered stars such as  Beta Aurigae ,  Alpha Coronae Borealis ,  Beta Crateris ,  Beta Eridani  and  Beta Serpentis . [110]  This is one of three large clusters located within 500 light-years (150\u00a0pc) of the Sun. The other two are the  Hyades  and the  Pleiades , and each of these clusters consists of hundreds of stars. [111] \nA bust of  Sopdet , Egyptian goddess of Sirius and the fertility of the  Nile ,  syncretized  with  Isis  and  Demeter \n Etymology and cultural significance [ edit ] \n See also:  Winter Triangle \n The most commonly used proper name of this star comes from the Latin  S\u012brius , from the  Ancient Greek   \u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2  ( Seirios , \"glowing\" or \"scorcher\"), [112]  although the Greek word itself may have been imported from elsewhere before the  Archaic period , [113]  one authority suggesting a link with the Egyptian god  Osiris . [114]  The name's earliest recorded use dates from the 7th century BC in  Hesiod 's poetic work  Works and Days . [113]  In 2016, the  International Astronomical Union  organized a  Working Group on Star Names  (WGSN) [115]  to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 [116]  included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included  Sirius  for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. [117] \n Sirius has over 50 other designations and names attached to it. [82]  In  Geoffrey Chaucer 's essay  Treatise on the Astrolabe , it bears the name Alhabor, and is depicted by a hound's head. This name is widely used on medieval  astrolabes  from Western Europe. [19]  In  Sanskrit  it is known as  Mrgavyadha  \"deer hunter\", or  Lubdhaka  \"hunter\". As Mrgavyadha, the star represents  Rudra  ( Shiva ). [118] [119]  The star is referred as  Makarajyoti  in  Malayalam  and has religious significance to the pilgrim center  Sabarimala . [120]  In Scandinavia, the star has been known as  Lokabrenna  (\"burning done by Loki\", or \"Loki's torch\"). [121]  In the  astrology  of the  Middle Ages , Sirius was a  Behenian fixed star , [122]  associated with  beryl  and  juniper . Its astrological symbol   was listed by  Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa . [123] \n Many cultures have historically attached special significance to Sirius, particularly in relation to dogs. It is often colloquially called the \"Dog Star\" as the brightest star of  Canis Major , the \"Great Dog\" constellation. \n It was classically depicted as  Orion 's dog. The Ancient Greeks thought that Sirius's emanations could affect dogs adversely, making them behave abnormally during the \"dog days,\" the hottest days of the summer. The Romans knew these days as  dies caniculares , and the star Sirius was called Canicula, \"little dog.\" The excessive panting of dogs in hot weather was thought to place them at risk of desiccation and disease. In extreme cases, a foaming dog might have  rabies , which could infect and kill humans they had bitten. [31]   Homer , in the  Iliad , describes the approach of  Achilles  toward  Troy  in these words: \n Sirius rises late in the dark, liquid sky \nOn summer nights, star of stars, \nOrion's Dog they call it, brightest \nOf all, but an evil portent, bringing heat \nAnd fevers to suffering humanity. [124] \n In Iranian mythology, especially in  Persian mythology  and in  Zoroastrianism , the ancient religion of  Persia , Sirius appears as  Tishtrya  and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishtar of  New Persian  poetry). Beside passages in the  sacred texts  of the  Avesta , the  Avestan  language  Tishtrya  followed by the version  Tir  in  Middle  and New Persian is also depicted in the  Persian  epic  Shahnameh  of  Ferdowsi . Due to the concept of the  yazatas , powers which are \"worthy of worship\", Tishtrya is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of  apaosha , the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya is depicted as a white horse. [125] [126] [127] [128] \n In  Chinese astronomy  the star is known as the star of the \"celestial wolf\" ( Chinese  and  Japanese : \u5929\u72fc  Chinese romanization : Ti\u0101nl\u00e1ng;  Japanese romanization : Tenr\u014d; [129] ) in the  Mansion of J\u01d0ng  (\u4e95\u5bbf). Many nations among the indigenous peoples of North America also associated Sirius with canines; the  Seri  and  Tohono O'odham  of the southwest note the star as a dog that follows mountain sheep, while the  Blackfoot  called it \"Dog-face\". The  Cherokee  paired Sirius with Antares as a dog-star guardian of either end of the \"Path of Souls\". The  Pawnee  of Nebraska had several associations; the Wolf (Skidi) tribe knew it as the \"Wolf Star\", while other branches knew it as the \"Coyote Star\". Further north, the Alaskan  Inuit  of the  Bering Strait  called it \"Moon Dog\". [130] \n Several cultures also associated the star with a bow and arrows. The ancient Chinese visualized a large bow and arrow across the southern sky, formed by the constellations of  Puppis  and Canis Major. In this, the arrow tip is pointed at the wolf Sirius. A similar association is depicted at the  Temple of Hathor  in  Dendera , where the goddess  Satet  has drawn her arrow at  Hathor  (Sirius). Known as \"Tir\", the star was portrayed as the arrow itself in later Persian culture. [131] \n Sirius is mentioned in  Surah ,  An-Najm  (\"The Star\"), of the  Qur'an , where it is given the name  \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0650\u0651\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649  (transliteration:  a\u0161-\u0161i\u2018r\u0101  or  ash-shira ; the leader). [132]  The verse is: \" \u0648\u0623\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0650\u0651\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649 \", \"That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star).\" (An-Najm:49) [133]   Ibn Kathir  said in his commentary \"that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship.\" [134]  The alternate name  Aschere , used by  Johann Bayer , is derived from this. [18] \n In  Theosophy , it is believed the  Seven Stars of the  Pleiades  transmit the  spiritual energy  of the  Seven Rays  from the  Galactic Logos  to the  Seven Stars of the  Great Bear , then to Sirius. From there is it sent via the Sun to the god of Earth ( Sanat Kumara ), and finally through the seven  Masters of the Seven Rays  to the human race. [135] \n Dogon [ edit ] \n See also:  Nommo \n The  Dogon people  are an  ethnic  group in  Mali , West Africa, reported by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible without the use of telescopes. In 1938  Marcel Griaule  produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the  \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes  (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books  Conversations with Ogotemm\u00eali  1965 and  The Pale Fox  1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B.  Robert Temple 's 1976 book  The Sirius Mystery , credits them with knowledge of the four Galilean moons of  Jupiter  and the rings of  Saturn . This has been the subject of controversy and speculation. \n Yoonir , symbol of the universe in  Serer religion . [136] [137] \n Doubts have been raised about the validity of Griaule and Dieterlein's work. [138] [139]  In a 1991 article in  Current Anthropology  anthropologist Walter van Beek concluded after his research among the Dogon that, \"Though they do speak about  sigu tolo  [which is what Griaule claimed the Dogon called Sirius] they disagree completely with each other as to which star is meant; for some it is an invisible star that should rise to announce the  sigu  [festival], for another it is Venus that, through a different position, appears as  sigu tolo . All agree, however, that they learned about the star from Griaule.\" [140] \n Noah Brosch  explained in his book  Sirius Matters  that the cultural transfer of relatively modern astronomical information could have taken place in 1893, when a French expedition arrived in Central West Africa to observe the total eclipse on April 16. \n Serer religion [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Serer religion  and  Saltigue \n In the  religion  of the  Serer people  of  Senegal ,  the Gambia  and  Mauritania , Sirius is called  Yoonir  from the  Serer language  (and some of the  Cangin language  speakers, who are all ethnically Serers). The star Sirius is one of the most important and sacred stars in  Serer religious cosmology  and symbolism. The Serer high priests and priestesses, ( Saltigues , the hereditary \"rain priests\" [141] ) chart  Yoonir  in order to forecast rain fall and enable Serer farmers to start planting seeds. In Serer religious cosmology, it is the symbol of the universe. [136] [137] \n Modern significance [ edit ] \n See also:  Sirius in fiction \n Sirius is a frequent  subject  of  science fiction , [142]  and has been the subject of poetry. [143]   Dante  and  John Milton  reference the star, while  Tennyson 's poem  The Princess  describes the star's  scintillation : \n ..the fiery Sirius alters hue \nAnd bickers into red and emerald. [144] \n Other modern references: \n Plans for using  solar sail  propulsion for interstellar travel have targeted Sirius as the star system fastest to arrive at from Earth. [145]  While Alpha Centauri and others are closer, the brightness of Sirius provides the best braking power to arrive with the least travel time. \n Sirius is featured on the coat of arms of  Macquarie University , and is the name of its alumnae journal. [146] \n The name of the North American  satellite radio  company, Satellite CD Radio, Inc., was changed to  Sirius Satellite Radio  in November 1999, being named after \"the brightest star in the night sky\". [147] \n Composer  Karlheinz Stockhausen , who wrote a piece called  Sirius , has been claimed to have said on several occasions that he came from a planet in the Sirius system. [148] [149]  To Stockhausen, Sirius stood for 'the place where music is the highest of vibrations' and where music had been developed in the most perfect way. [150] \n Astronomer Noah Brosch has speculated that the name of the character  Sirius Black  from the  Harry Potter  stories, who has a unique ability to transform into a black dog, might have been inspired by \"Sirius B\". [143] \n Sirius is one of the 27 stars on the  flag of Brazil , where it represents the state of  Mato Grosso . [151] \n The Swedish  football  team  IK Sirius  from  Uppsala , who currently plays in the top tier  Allsvenskan , is named after the star system. [152] \n Vehicles: \n Seven ships of Great Britain's  Royal Navy  have been called  HMS\u00a0 Sirius  since the 18th century, with  the first  being the  flagship  of the  First Fleet  to Australia in 1788. [153] \n The  Royal Australian Navy  subsequently named a vessel  HMAS\u00a0 Sirius  in honor of the flagship. [154] \n American vessels include the  USNS\u00a0 Sirius  as well as a monoplane model\u2014the  Lockheed Sirius , the first of which was flown by  Charles Lindbergh . [155]  The name was also adopted by  Mitsubishi Motors  for the  Mitsubishi Sirius engine  in 1980. [156] \n See also [ edit ] \n Star portal \n Sothic cycle \n Notes [ edit ] \n ^   Compare the meaning of the Egyptian name with Sirius's completion of the  Winter Triangle   asterism , joining the other two brightest stars of the northern winter sky,  Betelgeuse  and  Procyon . \n ^   As Sirius is visible together with the constellation of  Orion , the Egyptians worshipped Orion as the god  Sah , the husband of Sopdet, with whom she had a son, the sky god  Sopdu . The goddess Sopdet was later  syncretized  with the goddess  Isis , Sah was linked with  Osiris , and Sopdu was linked with  Horus . The joining of Sopdet with Isis would allow  Plutarch  to state that \"The soul of Isis is called Dog by the Greeks\", meaning Sirius worshipped as Isis-Sopdet by Egyptians was named the Dog by the Greeks and Romans. The 70-day period of the absence of Sirius from the sky was understood as the passing of Sopdet-Isis and Sah-Osiris through the  Egyptian underworld .
