It was founded in 2007 with headquarters in  Phoenix, Arizona . [1]  The company\u2019s current vehicles include the  Rally Fighter  and their 3D-printed Strati and Swim vehicles. The company develops vehicles using  3D Printing  and utilizes vehicle designs provided by the online community. In 2016, the company introduced an autonomous electric-powered shuttle named Olli. \n Contents \n 1   Community \n 2   Rally Fighter \n 3   Strati \n 4   LM3D Swim \n 5   Olli \n 6   Locations \n 7   See also \n 8   References \n 9   External links \n Community [ edit ] \n Local Motors' website is a community focusing on vehicle innovation. The content is created by the users who discuss designing, engineering, and building innovative vehicles. Members contribute their own ideas and projects which are discussed with the community. [2] \n Co-creation is a technique used by Local Motors,  General Electric , and  LEGO  to enhance new product development. [3] [4]  Select organizations have partnered with the company to facilitate co-creation of their products including  US Army , [5]   Domino\u2019s , [6]  and  Airbus . [7]  Local Motors uses Co-designing type of customer co-creation in which the selective process is made by its community and some features such as frame and structure are scoped by the company. Firstly, users create drawing designs and the decorative ideas on their own style. Although the users are novices or experts, all users can participate in this step. After that users present their designs on the website, the best design selected by people in the community will be developed by the company. Finally, the company will launch the co-designing car into the market. Using Co-creation method, company gains customer\u2019s engagement and loyalty. [8] \n One of the biggest community driven competitions was hosted by Local Motors in collaboration with  Airbus . [9] \n Rally Fighter [ edit ] \n The Rally Fighter  [10]  was the first model produced by Local Motors and is an Open sourced vehicule . The car was introduced in 2010 after 12 months of development, which constitutes a record Time to Market compared to the automobile industry standards, by applying innovative technologies and crowd sourcing techniques. [11]  As the company describes it, the Rally Fighter is \"a fully capable off-road prerunner, with the amenities and luxuries of an every-day on road vehicle\". [12] \n Strati [ edit ] \n Main article:  Strati (automobile) \n In collaboration with Cincinnati Incorporated and  Oak Ridge National Laboratory  Local Motors manufactured Strati, the world's first  3D printed   electric car . [13]  The printing took 44 hours to complete, and was witnessed by a live audience at the 2014  International Manufacturing Technology Show  in  McCormick Place ,  Chicago . [14]  The car consists of 50 individual parts, far less than a traditional vehicle (which is manufactured with roughly 30,000 parts). [15]  The Strati was designed by Michele Ano\u00e8, [16]  a member of the Local Motors community, and is produced in small quantities to serve strategic partnerships, such as with  NXP Semiconductors . [17] \n LM3D Swim [ edit ] \n In 2015, the company debuted a 3D-printed car named the LM3D Swim. [18]  It was designed by Kevin Lo, a member of the Local Motors community. [19]  The materials used are 80 percent ABS plastic and 20 percent carbon fiber. The vehicle uses technology provided by  IBM  that offered IoT connectivity. [20]  The Swim is currently on display at the company\u2019s location in  National Harbor ,  Maryland . \n Olli [ edit ] \n In 2016, the company unveiled an autonomous, electric-powered bus. [21] [22]  The vehicle was designed by Edgar Sarmiento, initially named the \"Berlino\" from the Urban Mobility Challenge: Berlin 2030. [23]  The vehicle was built by Local Motors and has  IBM Watson  technology installed to provide a personalized experience for riders. The vehicle was demonstrated live to their online audience on Facebook Live [24]  at a media event in National Harbor. The vehicle is still undergoing development. \n Olli was manufactured in  Chandler ,  Arizona  using additive manufacturing techniques, including 3D Printing. [25]  The company has not announced pricing yet. \n Miami-Dade County , the State of  Nevada  and the Danish  Vesthimmerland Municipality  expressed interest in using Olli on their roadways. [26] [27] [28] \n Locations [ edit ] \n Local Motors operates five locations in  Phoenix ,  Knoxville ,  Las Vegas ,  National Harbor , and  Berlin . The company also hosts educational events that are focused on technology, science, and manufacturing topics. People can visit their retail locations in Phoenix, Knoxville, and National Harbor to purchase sustainable and locally-sourced merchandise. [29] \n As of February 2017, Local Motors has closed its  Chandler ,  Las Vegas  and  Knoxville  locations.
