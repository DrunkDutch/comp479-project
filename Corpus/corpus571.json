Tankers, ferries and trawlers turned out all along the east coast to salute her. In the English Channel, she had a memorable encounter with HMS London, the Royal Navy's newest vessel.  London  signalled the message  \"The Navy's newest ironclad is in company with the oldest... I hope we look as good as you at your age\" \n On June 16th 1987, 58 years after she left Portsmouth in a terrible state,  Warrior  made her triumphant return. As she came slowly towards the narrow entrance to Portsmouth Harbour an armada of small boats greeted her, guns fired, klaxons sounded, crowds cheered, fireworks exploded, and thousands of red, white and blue balloons filled the air. \n It could have been when, as the pride of the fleet, she had first stirred the country's imagination. \n After an hour of careful manoeuvring, she entered her berth. At 5:45pm the tow rope was dropped and\u00a0 Warrior  was home to stay - taking her place within Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. \n Stay connected \n CONTACT US \n Tel:  +44 (0) 23 9283 9766 \n Email:  enquiries@historicdockyard.co.uk \n \u00a9 2015 HMS Warrior Preservation Trust - Registered in England No. 936870. \nRegistered Charity Number 256756.
