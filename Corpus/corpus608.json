Nor do I know what a deletion review looks like or what the rules for posting there are. Please don't kick me out, I just wanted to express that the \"we agree with the portuguese wikipedia! argument is no longer valid. She did exist, was a recognized, acclaimed and toponymical-ubiquitious poet, as the Portuguese and German wikipedias now acknowledge. So maybe someone could help me with the uphill effort of keep submitting(no other term for it) articles on Portuguese language poets only to see them deleted as vanity-something-or-other, which is almost funny as almost all of those I have tried to add to the English language wikipedia have been long dead.

Ward3001  ( talk ) 16:15, 21 May 2008 (UTC) \n Suspected Sockpuppet [ edit ] \n  You have been accused of  sockpuppetry , which means that someone suspects you of using multiple Wikipedia accounts for prohibited purposes. Please make yourself familiar with the  notes for the suspect , then respond to the evidence at  Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Domaleixo\u200e . Thank you.  Kman543210  ( talk ) 15:18, 1 November 2008 (UTC) \n December 2010 [ edit ] \n  Welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the encyclopedia, but when you add or change content, as you did to the article  Status of religious freedom by country ,  please cite a  reliable source  for the content of your edit. This helps maintain our policy of  verifiability . Take a look at  Wikipedia:Citing sources  for information about how to cite sources and the  welcome page  to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Thank you.  I've redone your change re Portugal. The previously cited source was a dead link; I've replaced that with a live link and reconformed the article assertion to info in that source.

When  editing an article on Wikipedia  there is a small field labeled \" Edit summary \" under the main edit-box. It looks like this: \n The text written here will appear on the  Recent changes  page, in the  page revision history , on the  diff page , and in the  watchlists  of users who are watching that article. See  m:Help:Edit summary  for full information on this feature. \n Filling in the edit summary field greatly helps your fellow contributors in understanding what you changed, so please always fill in the edit summary field. If you are adding a section, please do not just keep the previous section's header in the Edit summary field \u2013 please fill in your new section's name instead. Thank you. -  220   of   Borg  18:27, 1 August 2012 (UTC) \n All edits marked as minor? [ edit ] \n  Thank you for  your contributions . Please remember to mark your edits as \"minor\" only if they truly are minor edits. In accordance with  Help:Minor edit , a minor edit is one that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute. Minor edits consist of things such as typographical corrections, formatting changes, or rearrangement of text without modification of content. Additionally, the  reversion  of clear-cut  vandalism  and test edits may be labeled \"minor\". Thank you. -  220   of   Borg  19:02, 1 August 2012 (UTC) \n -  Final 'nag', did you mean to put the text at the top of the  Kellie Waymire  page  here ?

Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited  Ignatius of Loyola , you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page  Basque Country  ( check to confirm \u00a0|\u00a0 fix with Dab solver ).

As much as the political name may include \"Uni\u00e3o de freguesias\", this is likely a temporary term. Until a final decision has been made by the IGP, there is no clear indication that those names are valid beyond the legality of the politico-administrative context. As you should be aware, most of the  freguesia  articles refer to the geographic context and not the political alone. People are not going to be using that affectation when referring to merged regions: these civil parishes will continue to exist as separate geographic areas, even if the political evolution continue. Since the IGP is the arbitrator of geographic context, the use of  Uni\u00e3o de freguesia  in article namespaces implies a subject matter that does not exist. I realize that Wikipedia PT has not arbitrated on this subject (and they themselves do not arbitrate on Wikipedia EN), but it is premature to start creating long-winded names, when they will likely change with the IGP ruling. Even then, Wikipedia EN (and I refer you to  Wikipedia:Article titles ) states that article names should be natural, concise and consistent. Further, the intended creation of  Uni\u00e3o de  article names has the affect of creating non-existent pages or  red-link  pages for items that may never result in article in the foreseeable future. Regardless, I apologize for reverting in total, since changes to the presidents and party affiliations are naturally important to content (a bug exists in the Rollback functionality). Regarding this subject (administratively united parishes) I suggest continuing the conversation on  Wikipedia:WikiProject Portuguese geography  in the appropriate sub-heading.  ruben jc   ZEORYMER  ( talk ) 20:07, 8 December 2013 (UTC) \n WP:ES [ edit ] \n Hi there.
