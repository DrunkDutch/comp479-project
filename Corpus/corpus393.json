It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic,  ductile   metal  in the  boron group . By mass, aluminium makes up about 8% of the  Earth's crust ; it is the third most abundant element after  oxygen  and  silicon  and the most abundant metal in the crust, though it is less common in the mantle below. The chief  ore  of aluminium is  bauxite . Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that  native specimens  are rare and limited to extreme  reducing  environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different  minerals . [5] \n Aluminium is remarkable for its low  density  and its ability to resist  corrosion  through the phenomenon of  passivation . Aluminium and its  alloys  are vital to the  aerospace  industry [6]  and important in  transportation  and building industries, such as building facades and window frames. [7]  The  oxides  and  sulfates  are the most useful compounds of aluminium. [6] \n Despite its prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium  salts   metabolically , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. [8]  Because of these salts' abundance, the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest, and studies continue. \n Contents \n 1   Physical characteristics \n 1.1   Nuclei and isotopes \n 1.2   Electron shell \n 1.3   Bulk \n 2   Chemistry \n 2.1   Inorganic compounds \n 2.1.1   Rarer oxidation states \n 2.1.1.1   Aluminium(I) \n 2.1.1.2   Aluminium(II) \n 2.2   Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides \n 3   Natural occurrence \n 4   History \n 4.1   Early history \n 4.2   Establishing nature of alum \n 4.3   Synthesis of metal \n 4.4   Rare metal \n 4.5   Electrolytic production \n 4.6   Mass usage \n 5   Etymology \n 5.1   Spelling \n 6   Production and refinement \n 6.1   Bayer process and Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult processes \n 6.2   Aluminium chloride electrolysis process \n 6.3   Aluminium carbothermic process \n 6.4   Recycling \n 7   Applications \n 7.1   General use \n 7.2   Aluminium compounds \n 7.2.1   Alumina \n 7.2.2   Sulfates \n 7.2.3   Chlorides \n 7.2.4   Niche compounds \n 7.3   Aluminium alloys in structural applications \n 8   Biology \n 9   Health concerns \n 9.1   Occupational safety \n 9.2   Alzheimer's disease \n 10   Effect on plants \n 11   Biodegradation \n 12   See also \n 13   Notes \n 14   References \n 15   Bibliography \n 16   Further reading \n 17   External links \n Physical characteristics \n Nuclei and isotopes \n Main article:  Isotopes of aluminium \n Aluminium's  atomic number  is 13. Of aluminium isotopes, only one is stable:  27 Al. It is the only  isotope that has existed on Earth in its current form since the creation of the planet . It is essentially the only isotope representing the element on Earth, which makes aluminium a  mononuclidic element  and practically equates its  standard atomic weight  to that of the isotope. Such a low standard atomic weight of aluminium [a]  has some effects on the properties of the element (see  below ). \n All other isotopes are  radioactive  and could not have survived; the most stable isotope of these is  26 Al ( half-life \u00a0720,000 years).  26 Al is produced from  argon  in the  atmosphere  by  spallation  caused by  cosmic ray  protons. Aluminium isotopes are useful in dating. The ratio of  26 Al to  10 Be  has been used to study transport, deposition,  sediment  storage, burial times, and erosion on 10 5  to 10 6  year time scales. [9]   Cosmogenic   26 Al was first applied in studies of the Moon and meteorites. Meteoroid fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial  26 Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding drastically reduces  26 Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that  26 Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of  26 Al was responsible for the melting and  differentiation  of some  asteroids  after their formation 4.55 billion years ago. [10] \n The remaining isotopes of aluminium, with mass numbers ranging from 21 to 43, all have half-lives well under an hour. Three  metastable  states are known, all with half-lives under a minute. [11] \n Electron shell \n An aluminium atom has 13 electrons, arranged in an  electron configuration  of [ Ne ]3s 2 3p 1 , with three atoms beyond a stable noble gas configuration. Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions (see  below ). \n At  standard temperature and pressure , aluminium atoms (when not affected by atoms of other elements) form a  face-centered cubic crystal system  bound by  metallic bonding  provided by atoms' outermost electrons; hence aluminium (at these conditions) is a metal. This crystal system is shared by some other metals, such as  lead  and  gold ; however, since atoms of these elements are significantly heavier while distances between atoms of an element is nowhere as long, aluminium is significantly lighter than these two. \n Bulk \nEtched surface from a high purity (99.9998%) aluminium bar, size 55\u00d737 mm \n Aluminium is a relatively soft, durable, lightweight,  ductile , and  malleable   metal  with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. It is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of  visible light  and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far  infrared  radiation. The  yield strength  of pure aluminium is 7\u201311  MPa , while  aluminium alloys  have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa. [12]  Aluminium has about one-third the  density  and  stiffness  of  steel . It is easily  machined ,  cast ,  drawn  and  extruded . \n Aluminium atoms are arranged in a  face-centered cubic  (fcc) structure. Aluminium has a  stacking-fault energy  of approximately 200 mJ/m 2 . [13] \n Aluminium is a good  thermal  and  electrical conductor , having 59% the conductivity of copper, both thermal and electrical, while having only 30% of  copper's  density. Aluminium is capable of  superconductivity , with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2  kelvin  and a critical magnetic field of about 100  gauss  (10  milliteslas ). [14]  Aluminium is the most common material for the fabrication of superconducting  qubits . [15] \n Chemistry \n See also:  Category:Aluminium compounds . \n Corrosion  resistance can be excellent because a thin surface layer of  aluminium oxide  forms when the bare metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further  oxidation , [16]  in a process termed  passivation . The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to  galvanic  reactions with alloyed  copper . [12]  This corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals. \n In highly acidic solutions, aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen, and in highly alkaline ones to form  aluminates \u2014 protective passivation under these conditions is negligible. Primarily because it is corroded by dissolved  chlorides , such as common  sodium chloride , household plumbing is never made from aluminium. [17] \n However, because of its general resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of  silver-colored  paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest  reflectance  of any metal in the 200\u2013400\u00a0nm ( UV ) and the 3,000\u201310,000\u00a0nm (far  IR ) regions; in the 400\u2013700\u00a0nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by  tin  and  silver  and in the 700\u20133000\u00a0nm (near IR) by  silver ,  gold , and  copper . [18] \n Aluminium is  oxidized  by  water  at temperatures below 280\u00a0\u00b0C to produce  hydrogen ,  aluminium hydroxide  and heat: \n 2 Al + 6 H 2 O \u2192 2 Al(OH) 3  + 3 H 2 \n This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. However, commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer, which inhibits the reaction, and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal. [19] \n Inorganic compounds \n The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The  coordination number  of such compounds varies, but generally Al 3+  is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless. [20] \n All four  trihalides  are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides,  aluminium fluoride  (AlF 3 ) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF 3  is related to the compactness of the  fluoride  ion, six of which can fit around the small Al 3+  center. AlF 3  sublimes (with cracking) at 1,291\u00a0\u00b0C (2,356\u00a0\u00b0F). With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are  dimeric  or  polymeric  with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist.  Acidification  of the oxides or  hydroxides  affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centers that feature both halide and  aquo ligands . When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as  [AlF(H \n2 O) \n5 ] 2+ ,  AlF \n3 (H \n2 O) \n3 , and  [AlF \n6 ] 3\u2212 . In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [Al 13 O 4 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12 ] 7+ . \nAluminium hydrolysis as a function of pH. [ citation needed ]  Coordinated water molecules are omitted. \n Aluminium forms one stable oxide with the  chemical formula  Al 2 O 3.  It can be found in nature in the mineral  corundum . [21]  Aluminium oxide is also commonly called  alumina . [22]   Sapphire  and  ruby  are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are  boehmite  and  diaspore . There are three trihydroxides:  bayerite ,  gibbsite , and  nordstrandite , which differ in their crystalline structure ( polymorphs ). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful. \n Aluminium carbide  (Al 4 C 3 ) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1,000\u00a0\u00b0C (1,832\u00a0\u00b0F). The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give  methane . The  acetylide , Al 2 (C 2 ) 3 , is made by passing  acetylene  over heated aluminium. \n Aluminium nitride  (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides, it features tetrahedral Al centers. It can be made from the elements at 800\u00a0\u00b0C (1,472\u00a0\u00b0F). It is air-stable material with a usefully high  thermal conductivity .  Aluminium phosphide  (AlP) is made similarly; it hydrolyses to give  phosphine : \n AlP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 Al(OH) 3  + PH 3 \n Rarer oxidation states \n Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al 3+  centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al 3+  species. \n Aluminium(I) \n AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition  AlI  is unstable at room temperature, converting to triiodide: [23] \n 3 \n AlI \n \u27f6 \n AlI \n 3 \n + \n 2 \n Al \n {\\displaystyle {\\ce {3AlI->{AlI3}+2Al}}} \n A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic  adduct  formed with  triethylamine ,  Al 4 I 4 (NEt 3 ) 4 . Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al 2 O and Al 2 S. Al 2 O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al 2 O 3 , with silicon at 1,800\u00a0\u00b0C (3,272\u00a0\u00b0F) in a  vacuum . [23]  Such materials quickly  disproportionate  to the starting materials. \n Aluminium(II) \n Very simple Al(II) compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of Al metal with oxidants. For example,  aluminium monoxide , AlO, has been detected in the gas phase after explosion [24]  and in stellar absorption spectra. [25]  More thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula R 4 Al 2  which contain an Al-Al bond and where R is a large organic  ligand . [26] \n Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides \n Main article:  Organoaluminium compound \nStructure of  trimethylaluminium , a compound that features five-coordinate carbon. \n A variety of compounds of empirical formula AlR 3  and AlR 1.5 Cl 1.5  exist. [27]  These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centers formed by dimerization with some R or Cl bridging between both Al atoms, e.g. \" trimethylaluminium \" has the formula Al 2 (CH 3 ) 6  (see figure). With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium compounds exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as  triisobutylaluminium . Such compounds [ which? ]  are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly  pyrophoric . Few analogues exist between  organoaluminium  and  organoboron  compounds other than [ clarification needed ]  large organic groups. \n The important [ clarification needed ]  aluminium hydride is  lithium aluminium hydride  (LiAlH 4 ), which is used in as a reducing agent in  organic chemistry . It can be produced from  lithium hydride  and aluminium trichloride: \n 4 LiH + AlCl 3  \u2192 LiAlH 4  + 3 LiCl \n Several useful derivatives of LiAlH 4  are known, e.g.  sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate . The simplest hydride,  aluminium hydride  or alane, remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH 3 ) n , in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula (BH 3 ) 2 . \n Natural occurrence \n See also:  List of countries by bauxite production \nBauxite, a major aluminium ore. The red-brown color is due to the presence of  iron  minerals. \n Stable aluminium is created when  hydrogen  fuses with  magnesium , either in large stars or in  supernovae . [28]  It is estimated to be the 14th most common element in the Universe, by mass-fraction. [29]  However, among the elements that have odd atomic numbers, aluminium is the third most abundant by mass fraction, after hydrogen and nitrogen. [29] \n In the  Earth's crust , aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by mass) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon). [20]  The Earth's crust has a greater abundance of aluminium than the rest of the planet, primarily in aluminium silicates. In the Earth's  mantle , which is only 2% aluminium by mass, these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by  silica  and magnesium oxides. Overall, the Earth is about 1.4% aluminium by mass (eighth in abundance by mass). Aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the Earth than in the Solar system and Universe because the more common elements (hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, carbon as hydrocarbon) are volatile at Earth's proximity to the Sun and large quantities of those were lost. \n Because of its strong affinity for oxygen, aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates.  Feldspars , the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen  fugacity  environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes. [30]  Native aluminium has been reported in  cold seeps  in the northeastern  continental slope  of the  South China Sea . Chen  et al.  (2011) [31]  propose the theory that these deposits resulted from  bacterial   reduction  of tetrahydroxoaluminate Al(OH) 4 \u2212 . [31] \n Aluminium also occurs in the minerals  beryl ,  cryolite ,  garnet ,  spinel , and  turquoise . [32]  Impurities in Al 2 O 3 , such as  chromium  and  iron , yield the  gemstones   ruby  and  sapphire , respectively. \n Although aluminium is a common and widespread element, not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the  ore  bauxite (AlO x (OH) 3\u20132 x ). Bauxite occurs as a  weathering  product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions. [33]  Bauxite is mined from large deposits in Australia, Brazil, Guinea, and Jamaica; it is also mined from lesser deposits in China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and Suriname. \n History \nThe statue of  Anteros  in  Piccadilly Circus , London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues cast in aluminium. \n Main article:  History of aluminium \n Early history \n Aluminium metal was unknown to ancient people. The only possibility [34] [35]  of an occurrence of the metal was recorded by Roman historian  Pliny the Elder ; [b]  however, this claim has been disputed. [36] \n The history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of  alum . First written record of alum, made by  Greek  historian  Herodotus , dates back to the 5th century BCE. [37]  The ancients are known to have used alum as dyeing mordants and for city defense. [37]  After the  Crusades , alum, a good indispensable in European fabric industry, [38]  was a subject of international commerce; [39]  it was imported to Europe from the eastern Mediterranean until the mid-15th century. [40] \n Establishing nature of alum \n The nature of alum remained unknown. Around 1530, Swiss physician  Paracelsus  identified alum as separate from  vitriole  (sulfates), suggesting it was a salt of an earth of alum. [41]  In 1595, German doctor and chemist  Andreas Libavius  demonstrated that alum and  green  and  blue  vitriole  were formed by the same acid but different earths; [42]  for the undiscovered earth that formed alum, he proposed the name \"alumina\". [41]  In 1722, German chemist  Friedrich Hoffmann  announced his belief that alum was a distinct earth. [43]  In 1728, French chemist  \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire  suggested that alum was formed by an unknown earth and the sulfuric acid. [43] \n In 1754, German chemist  Andreas Sigismund Marggraf  synthesized the earth of alum by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding  potash . [43]  In 1758, French chemist  Pierre Macquer  wrote that alumina [c]  resembled a metallic earth. [44]  In 1782, French chemist  Antoine Lavoisier  wrote he considered highly probable that alumina was an oxide of a metal which had an affinity for oxygen so strong no known reducing agents could overcome it. [45]  In 1783, Lavoisier replaced the dominant  phlogiston theory  with the idea of oxygen combustion and stated that metallic earths were  oxides  of their metals. [46]  Swedish chemist  J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius  suggested in 1815 [47]  the formula AlO 3  for alumina. [48]  The correct formula, Al 2 O 3 , was established by the German chemist Eilhard Mitscherlich in 1821; this helped Berzelius determine the correct atomic weight of the metal, 27. [48] \n Friedrich W\u00f6hler , the chemist who first thoroughly described the aluminium metal \n Synthesis of metal \n Attempts to produce the aluminium metal date back to 1760. [44]  The first successful attempt, however, was completed in 1824 by Danish physicist and chemist  Hans Christian \u00d8rsted . He reacted  anhydrous  aluminium chloride with  potassium   amalgam , yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin. [49] [50]  He presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in 1825. [51]  \u00d8rsted was mostly engaged with electromagnetism and gave little importance to his discovery; [52]  a different source suggests he could not continue his research because of financial reasons. [53] \n German chemist  Friedrich W\u00f6hler  visited \u00d8rsted in 1827. \u00d8rsted told W\u00f6hler he did not intend to continue his research on aluminium extraction. W\u00f6hler was engaged with the problem and investigated it on his return from Denmark. After repeating \u00d8rsted's experiments, W\u00f6hler did not identify any aluminium. [52]  (The reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in 1921.) [54]  He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium. [50]  In 1845, he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal. [54] \nThe 100 ounces (2.8\u00a0kg) capstone of the  Washington Monument  ( Washington, D.C. , United States) was made in 1884 from aluminium. At the time, it was the largest piece of aluminium ever cast. [55] \n Rare metal \n As W\u00f6hler's method could not yield great quantities of aluminium, the metal remained rare; its cost exceeded that of gold. [52] \n French chemist  Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville  announced an industrial method of aluminium production in 1854 at the  Paris Academy of Sciences . [56]  Aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium, which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium, which W\u00f6hler had used. [57]  Subsequently, bars of aluminium were exhibited for the first time to the general public at the  Exposition Universelle of 1855 . [58]  In 1856, Deville along with companions established the world's first industrial production of aluminium. [56]  From 1855 to 1859, the price of aluminium dropped by an order of magnitude, from US$500 to $40 per pound. [59]  Even then, aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample. [60] \n At the  next fair in Paris in 1867 , the visitors were presented aluminium wire and foil; by the time of the  next fair in 1878 , aluminium had become a symbol of the future. [61] \n Electrolytic production \n Aluminium was first synthesized electrolytically in 1854 by Deville and German chemist  Robert Wilhelm Bunsen . Their electrolysis methods did not become the basis for industrial production of aluminium because electrical supplies were inefficient at the moment; this would only change with the invention of the  dynamo  by Belgian engineer  Z\u00e9nobe-Th\u00e9ophile Gramme  in 1870 and the  three-phase current  by Russian engineer  Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky  in 1889. [62] \nAluminium factory in  Griesheim , Germany, constructed in 1915 \n The first industrial large-scale production method was independently developed by French engineer  Paul H\u00e9roult  and American engineer  Charles Martin Hall ; it is now known as the  Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process . H\u00e9roult long could not find enough interest in his invention as demand for aluminium was still small; he started industrial production of aluminium bronze in  Neuhausen am Rheinfall  in 1888. H\u00e9roult sold his patents in a year; the buyers appointed him to the position of director of a smelter in  Is\u00e8re , which would produce on a large scale aluminium bronze at the initiation and pure aluminium in a few months. At the same time, Hall invented the same process and successfully tested it. He then sought to employ it for a large-scale production; for that, however, the existing smelters refused to adopt the new technique. He started the  Pittsburgh Reduction Company  in 1888 where he initiated mass production of aluminium. In the coming years, this technology was improved and new factories were constructed. [63] \n The Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process converts alumina into the metal; Austrian chemist  Carl Joseph Bayer  discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina, now known as the  Bayer process , in 1889. Modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the Bayer and Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult processes. The Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process was further improved in 1920 by a team led by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm S\u00f6derberg; this improvement greatly increased the world output of aluminium. [64] \n Mass usage \n Give me 30,000 tonnes of aluminium, and I will win the  war . \n \u201c \n \u201d \n Soviet leader  Joseph Stalin  in writing to U.S. president  Franklin Roosevelt  in 1941 [65] \n Prices of aluminium did drop and aluminium had become widely used in jewelry, everyday items, eyeglass frames, and optical instruments by the early 1890s. Aluminium tableware began to be produced in the late 19th century and gradually supplanted copper and cast iron tableware in the first decades of the 20th century.  Aluminium foil  was also popularized at that time. Aluminium is soft and light; it was soon discovered, however, that alloying it with other metals could increase its hardness while preserving the low density. Aluminium's ability to form alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, aluminium bronze is applied to make flexible bands, sheets, and wire and is widely employed in the shipbuilding and aviation industries. [66]  During the  World War I , major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes. They often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems. [67]  Aviation during that time employed a new aluminium alloy,  duralumin , invented in 1903 by German materials scientist  Alfred Wilm . [68] \nWorld production of aluminium since 1900 \n By the mid-20th century, aluminium had become a part of everyday lives, also becoming an essential component of houseware. [69]  During the mid-20th century, aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material, with buildings using for both basic construction and interior, [70]  and advanced its use in military engineering, for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines. [65]  In the beginning of the second half of that century, the  space race  began.  Earth's first artificial satellite , launched in 1957, consisted of two separate aluminium semi-spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have been made of aluminium. [64]  The  aluminium can  was invented in 1956 and employed as a storage for drinks in 1958. [71] \n Throughout the 20th century, the production of aluminium rose rapidly: while the world production of aluminium in 1900 was 6,800 metric tons, the annual production first exceeded 100,000 metric tons in 1916; 1,000,000 tons in 1941; 10,000,000 tons in 1971. [72]  In the 1970s, the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity; it entered the  London Metal Exchange , the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world, in 1978. [64]  The output continued to grow: the annual production of aluminium exceeded 50,000,000 metric tons in 2013. [72] \n The price for aluminium declined from $721 per metric ton in 1900 to $331 in 1942. [72]  Extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies. However, the need to exploit lower-grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs (above all, energy) increased the net cost of aluminium. [73]  Prices began to grow in 1948. [72]  After aluminium became an exchange commodity, aluminium has been traded for  United States dollars  and its price fluctuated along with the exchange rates of the currency. [74]  In 2000, a metric ton of aluminium cost $1,640; in 2015, it cost $1,940 (all prices in contemporary dollars rather than  international ). [72] \n Etymology \n Aluminium is named after alumina, or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature. The word \"alumina\" comes from \"alum\", the mineral from which it was collected. The word \"alum\" comes from  alumen , a  Latin  word meaning \"bitter salt\". [75]  The word  alumen  stems from the  Proto-Indo-European  root  *alu-  meaning \"bitter\" or \"beer\". [76] \n British chemist  Humphry Davy , who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal, is credited as the person who named aluminium. [d]  In 1808, he suggested the metal be named  alumium . [78]  This suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from France, Germany, and Sweden, who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide, alumina, from which it would be isolated. [45]  In 1812, Davy chose  aluminum , thus producing the modern name. [79]  It is, however, spelled differently nowadays in the Northern America and most other countries:  aluminum  is in use in the U.S. and Canada while  aluminium  is in use elsewhere. [80] \n Spelling \n The  -ium  suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and  strontium  (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, element names ending in  -um  were not unknown at the time; for example,  platinum  (known to Europeans since the 16th century),  molybdenum  (discovered in 1778), and  tantalum  (discovered in 1802). The  -um  suffix is consistent with the universal spelling  alumina  for the  oxide  (as opposed to aluminia); compare to  lanthana , the oxide of  lanthanum , and  magnesia ,  ceria , and  thoria , the oxides of  magnesium ,  cerium , and  thorium , respectively. \n In 1812, British scientist  Thomas Young [81]  wrote an anonymous review of Davy's book, in which he objected to  aluminum  and proposed the name  aluminium : \"for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound.\" [82]  This name did catch up: while the  -um  spelling was occasionally used in Britain, the American scientific language used  -ium  from the start. [83]  Most scientists used  -ium  throughout the world in the 19th century; [84]  it still remains the standard in most other languages. [80]  In 1828, American\u00a0lexicographer  Noah Webster  used exclusively the  aluminum  spelling in his  American Dictionary of the English Language . [85]  In the 1830s, the  -um  spelling started to gain usage in the United States; by the 1860s, it had become the more common spelling there outside science. [83]  In 1892, Hall used the  -um  spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal, despite his constant use of the  -ium  spelling in all the patents he filed between 1886 and 1903. It was subsequently suggested this was a typo rather than intended. [80]  By 1890, both spellings had been common in the U.S. overall, the  -ium  spelling being slightly more common; by 1895, the situation had reversed; by 1900, aluminum had been twice as common as aluminium; during the following decade, the  -um  spelling dominated American usage. [86]  In 1925, the  American Chemical Society  adopted this spelling. [86] \n The  International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry  (IUPAC) adopted  aluminium  as the standard international name for the element in 1990. [87]  In 1993, they recognized  aluminum  as an acceptable variant; [87]  the same is true for the most recent  2005 edition of the IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry . [88]  IUPAC official publications use the  -ium  spelling as primary but list both where appropriate. [e]   English Wikipedia  follows this standard by  adopting  the \"aluminium\" spelling as the sole legitimate spelling in chemistry-related articles. \n Production and refinement \n See also:  List of countries by aluminium production \n Extrusion  billets of aluminium \n Bayer process and Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult processes \n Bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) by the  Bayer process . [8]  Relevant  chemical equations  are: \n Al 2 O 3  + 2 NaOH \u2192 2 NaAlO 2  + H 2 O \n 2 H 2 O + NaAlO 2  \u2192 Al(OH) 3  + NaOH \n 2  Al(OH) 3  \u2192  Al 2 O 3  + 3  H 2 O \n The intermediate, sodium aluminate, with the simplified formula NaAlO 2 , is soluble in strongly alkaline water, and the other components of the ore are not. Depending on the quality of the bauxite ore, twice as much waste (\" Bauxite tailings \") as alumina is generated. \n The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the  Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process . In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a molten (950 and 980\u00a0\u00b0C (1,740 and 1,800\u00a0\u00b0F)) mixture of  cryolite  (Na 3 AlF 6 ) with  calcium fluoride  is  electrolyzed  to produce metallic aluminium: \n Al 3+  + 3 e \u2212  \u2192 Al \n The liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off, and usually cast into large blocks called  aluminium billets  for further processing. Carbon dioxide is produced at the carbon anode: \n 2 O 2\u2212  + C \u2192 CO 2  + 4 e \u2212 \n The carbon anode is consumed by reaction with oxygen to form carbon dioxide gas, with a small quantity of  fluoride  gases. In modern smelters, the gas is filtered through alumina to remove fluorine compounds and return aluminium fluoride to the  electrolytic  cells. The anode (i.e. the reduction cell) must be replaced regularly, since it is consumed in the process. The cathode is also eroded, mainly by electrochemical processes and liquid metal movement  induced  by intense electrolytic currents. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear. \n Aluminium electrolysis with the  Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult  process consumes a lot of energy. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15\u00b10.5  kilowatt-hours  per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56\u00a0 MJ /kg). Some smelters achieve approximately 12.8\u00a0kW\u00b7h/kg (46.1\u00a0MJ/kg). (Compare this to the  heat of reaction , 31\u00a0MJ/kg, and the  Gibbs free energy  of reaction, 29\u00a0MJ/kg.) Minimizing line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200  kiloamperes ; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350\u00a0kA. \n The Hall\u2013Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the  Hoopes process . This process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%. [8] [90] \n Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the US. [87]  Aluminium producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive\u2014such as the United Arab Emirates with its large natural gas supplies, [91]  and Iceland [92]  and Norway [93]  with energy generated from  renewable sources . The world's largest  smelters  of alumina are located in the People's Republic of China, Russia and the provinces of  Quebec  and  British Columbia  in Canada. [94] [95] \nAluminium spot price 1987\u20132012 \n In 2005, the People's Republic of China was the top producer of aluminium with almost a one-fifth world share, followed by Russia, Canada, and the US, reports the  British Geological Survey . \n Over the last 50 years, Australia has become the world's top producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina (before being overtaken by China in 2007). [94] [96]  Australia produced 77 million  tonnes  of bauxite in 2013. [97]  The Australian deposits have some refining problems, some being high in silica, but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine. [98] \n Aluminium chloride electrolysis process \n The high energy consumption of Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process motivated the development of the electrolytic process based on  aluminium chloride . The pilot plant with 6500 tons/year output was started in 1976 by  Alcoa . The plant offered two advantages: (i) energy requirements were 40% less than plants using the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process, and (ii) the more accessible  kaolinite  (instead of  bauxite  and  cryolite ) was used for feedstock. Nonetheless, the pilot plant was shut down. The reasons for failure were the cost of aluminium chloride, general technology maturity problems, and leakage of the trace amounts of toxic  polychlorinated biphenyl  compounds. [99] [100] \n Aluminium chloride process can also be used for the co-production of  titanium , depending on titanium contents in  kaolinite . \n Aluminium carbothermic process \n The non-electrolytic  aluminium  carbothermic  process of aluminium production would theoretically be cheaper and consume less energy. However, it has been in the experimental phase for decades because the high operating temperature creates difficulties in material technology that have not yet been solved. [101] [102] \n Recycling \nAluminium  recycling code \n Main article:  Aluminium recycling \n Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. According to the  International Resource Panel 's  Metal Stocks in Society report , the global  per capita  stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics etc.) is 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb). Much of this is in more-developed countries (350\u2013500\u00a0kg (770\u20131,100\u00a0lb) per capita) rather than less-developed countries (35\u00a0kg (77\u00a0lb) per capita). Knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling. \n Recovery of the metal through  recycling  has become an important task of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium  beverage cans  brought it to public awareness. \n Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as  dross  (ash-like oxide). [103]  An aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross, with values reported below 1%. [104]  The dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium. \n Europe has achieved high rates of aluminium recycling ranging from 42% of beverage cans, 85% of construction materials, and 95% of transport vehicles. [105] \n Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections. Another important use is  extrusion . \n White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially. [106]  The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others,  hydrogen ,  acetylene , and  ammonia ), which spontaneously ignites on contact with air; [107]  contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, the waste is used as a filler in  asphalt  and  concrete . [108] \n Applications \n This section  needs additional citations for  verification .

(August 2014)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n General use \n Aluminium is the most widely used  non-ferrous metal . [109]  The global production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes. It exceeded that of any other metal except  iron  (837.5 million tonnes). [110] \n Aluminium is almost always alloyed, which markedly improves its mechanical properties, especially when  tempered . For example, the common  aluminium foils  and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium. [111]  The main  alloying  agents are  copper ,  zinc ,  magnesium ,  manganese , and  silicon  (e.g.,  duralumin ) with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight. [112] \nHousehold  aluminium foil \nAluminium-bodied  Austin  \"A40 Sports\"  (c. 1951) \n Aluminium can \n Some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in: \n Transportation [113]  ( automobiles , aircraft,  trucks ,  railway cars , marine vessels,  bicycles , spacecraft, etc.) as sheet, tube, and castings. \n Packaging [114]  ( cans , foil, frame of etc.). \n Food and beverage containers, because of its resistance to corrosion. \n Construction ( windows ,  doors ,  siding , building wire, sheathing, roofing, etc.). [115] \n A wide range of  household  items, from  cooking utensils  to  baseball bats  and  watches . [116] \n Street lighting  poles, [117]  sailing ship  masts ,  walking poles . \n Outer shells and cases for consumer electronics and photographic equipment. \n Electrical transmission lines  for power distribution (\"creep\" and oxidation are not issues in this application as the terminations are usually multi-sided \"crimps\" which enclose all sides of the conductor with a gas-tight seal). \n MKM steel [118]  and  Alnico  magnets. [119] \n Super purity aluminium (SPA, 99.980% to 99.999% Al), used in electronics and  CDs , and also in wires/cabling. \n Heat sinks  for  transistors ,  CPUs , and other components in electronic appliances. \n Substrate material of  metal-core copper clad laminates  used in high brightness  LED lighting . \n Light reflective surfaces and  paint . \n Pyrotechnics ,  solid rocket  fuels, explosives and  thermite \n Production of hydrogen gas by reaction with water or  sodium hydroxide . [120] \n In alloy with magnesium to make aircraft bodies and other transportation components. \n Cooking utensils, because of its resistance to corrosion and light-weight. [121] \n Coins  in such countries as France, Italy, Poland, Finland, Romania, Israel, and the former Yugoslavia struck from aluminium or an aluminium-copper alloy. [122] [123] \n Musical instruments. Some guitar models sport aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments, usually either chrome or black.  Kramer Guitars  and  Travis Bean  are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium, which gives the instrument a very distinctive sound. Aluminium is used to make some  guitar resonators  and some electric guitar speakers. [124] \n Aluminium is usually alloyed \u2013 it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness. The strength of aluminium alloys is abruptly increased with small additions of scandium, zirconium, or hafnium. [125]  A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by  physical vapor deposition  or (very infrequently)  chemical vapor deposition  or other chemical means [ which? ]  to form  optical coatings  and  mirrors . \n Aluminium compounds \n Because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity, the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications. \n Alumina \n Main article:  Aluminium oxide \n Aluminium oxide  (Al 2 O 3 ) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale. The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium. In 2013, about 10% of the domestic shipments in the United States were used for other applications. [126]  One major use is to absorb water where it is viewed as a contaminant or impurity. Alumina is used to remove water from hydrocarbons in preparation for subsequent processes that would be poisoned by moisture. \n Aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes; e.g. the  Claus process  to convert  hydrogen sulfide  to sulfur in  refineries  and to  alkylate   amines . Many industrial  catalysts  are  \"supported\"  by alumina, meaning that the expensive catalyst material (e.g.,  platinum ) is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina. \n Being a very hard material ( Mohs hardness  9), alumina is widely used as an abrasive; being extraordinarily chemically inert, it is useful in highly reactive environments such as  high pressure sodium  lamps. \n Sulfates \n Several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application.  Aluminium sulfate  (Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 \u00b7(H 2 O) 18 ) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms. About half of the production is consumed in  water treatment . The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a  mordant , in  fire extinguishers , in  fireproofing , as a  food additive  ( E number  E173), and in  leather tanning . Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called  ammonium alum , (NH 4 )Al(SO 4 ) 2 \u00b712H 2 O, is used as a  mordant  and in leather tanning, [127]  as is aluminium potassium sulfate ([Al(K)](SO 4 ) 2 )\u00b7(H 2 O) 12 . The consumption of both alums is declining. [ why? ] \n Chlorides \n Aluminium chloride  (AlCl 3 ) is used in  petroleum   refining  and in the production of  synthetic rubber  and polymers. Although it has a similar name,  aluminium chlorohydrate  has fewer and very different applications, particularly as a colloidal agent in water purification and an  antiperspirant . It is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal. \n Niche compounds \n This article  needs additional citations for  verification .

[128] \n Aluminium borate  (Al 2 O 3 \u00b7B 2 O 3 ) and  aluminium fluorosilicate  (Al 2 (SiF 6 ) 3 ) are used in the production of  glass ,  ceramics , synthetic  gemstones . \n Aluminium phosphate  (AlPO 4 ) used in the manufacture of glass, ceramic,  pulp  and paper products,  cosmetics , paints,  varnishes , and in dental  cement . [129] \n Aluminium hydroxide  (Al(OH) 3 ) is used as an  antacid , and mordant; it is used also in  water  purification, the manufacture of glass and ceramics, and in the  waterproofing   fabrics . [130] [131] \n Lithium aluminium hydride  is a powerful reducing agent used in  organic chemistry . [132] [133] \n Organoaluminiums  are used as  Lewis acids  and cocatalysts. [134] \n Methylaluminoxane  is a cocatalyst for  Ziegler-Natta   olefin   polymerization  to produce  vinyl polymers  such as  polyethene . [135] \n Aqueous aluminium ions (such as aqueous aluminium sulfate) are used to treat against fish parasites such as  Gyrodactylus salaris . \n In many  vaccines , certain aluminium salts serve as an immune  adjuvant  (immune response booster) to allow the  protein  in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant. \n Aluminium alloys in structural applications \n Main article:  Aluminium alloy \n Aluminium foam \n This section  does not  cite  any  sources .

(August 2014)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ( ANSI ) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ( DIN  and  ISO ). \n The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation. \n One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their  fatigue  strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined  fatigue limit , meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. Engineers must assess applications and design for a  fixed and finite life  of the structure, rather than infinite life. \n Another important property of aluminium alloys is sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Manual  blow torch  operations require additional skill and experience. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting. The lower  melting point s of aluminium alloys make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling\u2014in effect  annealing  the stresses. \n The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded use in rocketry, even in combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500\u00a0K. The  Agena  upper stage engine used regeneratively cooled aluminium in some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region. \n Another alloy of some value is  aluminium bronze  (Cu-Al alloy). \n Biology \n\" Bauxite tailings \" storage facility in  Stade , Germany. The aluminium industry generates about 70 million tons of this waste annually. \nSchematic of Al absorption by human skin. [136] \nThere are five major Al forms absorbed by human body: the free solvated trivalent cation (Al 3+ (aq) ); low-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (LMW-Al 0 (aq) ); high-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (HMW-Al 0 (aq) ); low-molecular-weight, charged, soluble complexes (LMW-Al(L) n +/\u2212 (aq) ); nano and micro-particulates (Al(L) n(s) ). They are transported across cell membranes or cell epi-/ endothelia  through five major routes: (1)  paracellular ; (2)  transcellular ; (3)  active transport ; (4) channels; (5) adsorptive or receptor-mediated  endocytosis . [136] \n Despite its widespread occurrence in the Earth crust, aluminium has no known function in biology. Aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic,  aluminium sulfate  having an  LD 50  of 6207\u00a0mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500\u00a0grams for an 80\u00a0kg (180\u00a0lb) person. [8]  The extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce. \n Health concerns \n In very high doses, aluminium is associated with altered function of the  blood\u2013brain barrier . [137]  A small percentage of people are  allergic  to aluminium and experience  contact dermatitis ,  digestive  disorders,  vomiting  or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as  antiperspirants  and antacids. In those without allergies, aluminium is not as toxic as  heavy metals , but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in amounts greater than 40\u00a0mg/day per kg of  body mass . [138]  The use of aluminium  cookware  has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general, however excessive consumption of  antacids  containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels. [ citation needed ]  Consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption, [139]  and  maltol  has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues. [140]  Aluminium increases  estrogen -related  gene expression  in human  breast cancer  cells cultured in the laboratory. [141]  The estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as  metalloestrogens . \n There is little evidence that aluminium in antiperspirants causes skin irritation. [8]  Nonetheless, its occurrence in antiperspirants,  dyes  (such as aluminium  lake ), and food additives has caused concern. [142]  Although there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adults, [143]  some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal. [142]  Aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water. [144]  It is classified as a non-carcinogen by the  US Department of Health and Human Services . [138] \n In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium,  deferoxamine mesylate  may be given to help eliminate it from the body by  chelation . [145] \n Occupational safety \n Exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause  pulmonary fibrosis . The United States  Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) has set a  permissible exposure limit  of 15\u00a0mg/m 3  time weighted average (TWA) for total exposure and 5\u00a0mg/m 3  TWA for respiratory exposure. The US  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH)  recommended exposure limit  is the same for respiratory exposure but is 10\u00a0mg/m 3  for total exposure, and 5\u00a0mg/m 3  for fumes and powder. \n Fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode, posing another workplace hazard. [146] [147] \n Alzheimer's disease \n Aluminium has controversially been implicated as a factor in  Alzheimer's disease . [148]  According to the  Alzheimer's Society , the medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship between aluminium and Alzheimer's disease. [149]  Nevertheless, some studies, such as those on the  PAQUID cohort , [150]  cite aluminium exposure as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Some  brain plaques  have been found to contain increased levels of the metal. [151]  Research in this area has been inconclusive; aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the disease rather than a causal agent. [152] [153] \n Effect on plants \n Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acid soils. Although it is generally harmless to plant growth in pH-neutral soils, the concentration in acid soils of toxic Al 3+   cations  increases and disturbs root growth and function. [154] [155] [156] [157] \n Most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than  hydrogen ions . The acidity of the soil is therefore, a result of  hydrolysis  of aluminium compounds. [158]  The concept of \"corrected lime potential\" [159]  is now used to define the degree of base saturation in  soil testing  to determine the \" lime  requirement\". [160] [161] \n Wheat  has  developed  a  tolerance   to  aluminium, releasing  organic compounds  that bind to harmful aluminium  cations .  Sorghum  is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat. It was shown that sorghum's aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene, as for wheat. [162]  This adaptation is not found in all plants. \n Biodegradation \n A Spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus  Geotrichum candidum  consumes the aluminium in  compact discs . [163] [164]  Other reports all refer back to the 2001 Spanish report and there is no supporting original research. Better documented, the bacterium  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and the fungus  Cladosporium  resinae  are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not AV gas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium. [165]  However, these life forms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium; rather, the metal is corroded by microbe waste products.

[1] \n ^   \"One day a goldsmith in Rome was allowed to show the Emperor  Tiberius  a dinner plate of a new metal. The plate was very light, and almost as bright as silver. The goldsmith told the Emperor that he had made the metal from plain clay. He also assured the Emperor that only he, himself, and the Gods knew how to produce this metal from clay. The Emperor became very interested, and as a financial expert he was also a little concerned. The Emperor felt immediately, however, that all his treasures of gold and silver would decline in value if people started to produce this bright metal of clay. Therefore, instead of giving the goldsmith the regard expected, he ordered him to be beheaded.\" [34] \n ^   The terms \"earth of alum\" and \"alumina\" refer to the same substance. The difference in the text between the two is only justified by how the authors referred to it: the mentioned German-speaking authors used \"earth of alum\" ( Alaun-Erde ) while the French authors used  alumina . \n ^   However, Davy was not the first person to invent the name. In 1782, French chemist  Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau  suggested for the \"base\" of (i.e., the metallic element in)  alum  the name  alumine . [77]  Note that the French names of the metals that end on -um, but not -ium, in English do not include that ending; if the pattern is followed, the English translation of that name would be \"aluminum\". \n ^   For instance, see the November\u2013December 2013 issue of  Chemistry International : in a table of (some) elements, the element is listed as \"aluminium (aluminum)\".
