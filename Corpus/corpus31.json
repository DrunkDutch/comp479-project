We\u2019re proud to bring new choice books to the city of Montreal, from Elizabeth Strout and Ursula K. Le Guin to James Baldwin and Yukio Mishima. We may be a small store, but our customers agree that when they peruse our shelves, we offer a diverse, well-curated selection. We specialize in literature, poetry, science fiction and fantasy, science, history and biography, and dedicated sections for linguistics and books about Japan. \nWe are also happy to offer a lounge space for readers to come, read, and relax, as well as regular events ranging from readings and signings to book clubs and write-ins. We exist to help out the reading and writing communities of Montreal. \n \u00a0 \n Come by and say hello! \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Argo Bookshop \t      1915 rue Sainte-Catherine ouest \t      \t      \t      \t      Montreal\u00a0QC\u00a0\u00a0H3H 1M3\t       Canada   \n \u00a0 \n\t    Phone: 514.931.3442\t    \t       \n\t      \t      Fax: 514.658.3446\t    \n\t     Email:  aW5mb0BhcmdvYm9va3Nob3AuY2E= \n  Powered by  Bookmanager"}
