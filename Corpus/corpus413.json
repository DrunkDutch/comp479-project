The music is represented as discrete musical notes positioned in several  channels  at discrete chronological positions on a vertical timeline. A music tracker's user interface is usually number based. Notes, parameter changes, effects and other commands are entered with the keyboard into a grid of fixed time slots as codes consisting of letters, numbers and  hexadecimal  digits. [1]  Separate patterns have independent timelines; a complete song consists of a master list of repeated patterns. \n Later trackers departed from solely using module files, adding other options both to the sound synthesis (hosting generic synthesizers and effects or  MIDI  output) and to the sequencing (MIDI input and recording), effectively becoming general purpose sequencers with a different user interface. \n Music trackers like DefleMask and FamiTracker are commonly used to create  chiptunes . \n Contents \n 1   History \n 1.1   1987: origins on the Amiga \n 1.2   1990s: MS-DOS PC versions \n 1.3   2000s: Multiple platforms \n 1.4   2010s: Current state \n 2   Terminology \n 3   Use in professional music \n 4   Selected list of music trackers \n 4.1   Windows, macOS, and Linux \n 4.2   Interpreted platforms \n 4.3   Atari ST / STE / Falcon \n 4.4   Commodore 8 bit machines (C64 / Plus/4 / C16) \n 4.5   Amiga \n 4.6   DOS \n 4.7   Other operating systems \n 5   See also \n 6   Further reading \n 7   External links \n 8   References \n History [ edit ] \nSchism Tracker with a classical  text mode  based  GUI , typical for trackers of the 1980s and 1990s, playing a module from the video game  Bejeweled  by Finnish composer  Skaven . \n Demoscene \n Concepts \n Chiptune \n Demo \n Intro \n Demoparty \n Effects \n Demogroup \n Compo \n Diskmag \n Module file \n Tracker \n Alternative demo platforms \n Amiga \n Atari ST \n Commodore 64 \n ZX Spectrum \n Current  parties \n Alternative Party \n Assembly \n The Gathering \n Revision \n X \n Past parties \n Breakpoint \n The Party \n Websites \n Scene.org \n Mod Archive \n Magazines \n TraxWeekly \n Static Line \n Scene World \n Hugi \n Software \n OpenMPT \n ProTracker \n Scream Tracker \n FastTracker 2 \n Impulse Tracker \n Renoise \n MilkyTracker \n Tracker musicians \n Demosceners \n v \n t \n e \n 1987: origins on the Amiga [ edit ] \n The term tracker derives from  Ultimate Soundtracker ; the first tracker software. [2]   Ultimate Soundtracker  was written by Karsten Obarski and released in 1987 by EAS Computer Technik for the  Commodore Amiga . [3]   Ultimate Soundtracker  was a commercial product, but soon  shareware   clones  such as  NoiseTracker  appeared as well. The general concept of step-sequencing samples numerically, as used in trackers, is also found in the  Fairlight CMI  sampling workstation of the early 1980s. Some early tracker-like programs appeared for the  MSX  ( Yamaha CX5M ) and  Commodore 64 , before 1987, such as  Sound Monitor , but these did not feature sample playback, instead playing notes on the computer's internal synthesizer. Later, in Rock Monitor 3 and 4 they implemented sample player, usually with short drum samples loaded in RAM memory. \n The first trackers supported four pitch and volume modulated channels of 8-bit  PCM   samples , a limitation derived from the Amiga's  Paula  audio chipset and the commonplace  8SVX  format used to store sampled sound. However, since the notes were samples, the limitation was less important than those of synthesizing music chips. [4] \n 1990s: MS-DOS PC versions [ edit ] \n During the 1990s, tracker musicians gravitated to the PC as software production in general switched from the Amiga platform to the PC. Although the IBM and compatibles initially lacked the hardware sound processing capabilities of the Amiga, with the advent of the  Sound Blaster  line from  Creative , PC audio slowly began to approach  CD  Quality ( 44.1\u00a0kHz/16\u00a0bit/Stereo ) with the release of the  SoundBlaster 16 . \n Another sound card popular on the PC tracker scene was the  Gravis Ultrasound , which continued the hardware mixing tradition, with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage. For a time, it offered unparalleled sound quality and became the choice of discerning tracker musicians. Understanding that the support of tracker music would benefit sales, Gravis gave away some 6000 GUS cards to participants. Coupled with excellent developer documentation, this gesture quickly prompted the GUS to become an integral component of many tracking programs and software. Inevitably, the balance was largely redressed with the introduction of the  Sound Blaster AWE32  and its successors, which also featured on-board RAM and  wavetable  (or  sample  table) mixing. \nScreenshot of  Scream Tracker  3.21, a popular Tracker for the PC during the 1990s \n The responsibility for  audio mixing  passed from hardware to software (the main  CPU ), which gradually enabled the use of more and more channels. From the typical 4 MOD channels of the Amiga, the limit had moved to 7 with  TFMX  players and 8, first with  Oktalyzer  and later with the vastly more popular  OctaMED  (all Amiga programs), then 32 with  ScreamTracker  3 and  FastTracker 2  on the PC and on to 64 with  Impulse Tracker  (PC) and MED SoundStudio (Amiga and later PC). An Amiga tracker called Symphonie Pro even supported 256 channels. \n As such, hardware mixing did not last. As processors got faster and acquired special multimedia processing abilities (e.g.  MMX ) and companies began to push  Hardware Abstraction Layers , like DirectX, the AWE and GUS range became obsolete.  DirectX ,  WDM  and, now more commonly,  ASIO , deliver high-quality sampled audio irrespective of hardware brand. \n There was also a split off from the sample based trackers taking advantage of the OPL2/OPL3 chips of the Sound Blaster series. Adlib Tracker II and many others survive to this day. All Sound Tracker was able to combine both the FM synthesis of the OPL chips and the sample based synthesis of the EMU-8000 chips in the Sound Blaster AWE series of cards as well as MIDI output to any additional hardware of choice. \n 2000s: Multiple platforms [ edit ] \n Tracker music could be found in  computer games  of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as the  Unreal  series ,  Deus Ex ,  Crusader: No Remorse ,  Jazz Jackrabbit  and  Hitman: Codename 47 . Tracker software continues to develop. Some of the early Amiga trackers such as  ProTracker  and OctaMED have received various updates, mostly for porting to other platforms.  ProTracker  having resumed development in 2004, with plans for releasing version 5 to Windows and  AmigaOS , but only version 4.0 beta 2 for AmigaOS has been released. Other cross-platform trackers include  Renoise ,  MilkyTracker  and  SunVox . \n Buzz ,  OpenMPT , Renoise,  Psycle , and others offer features undreamed-of back in the day (improved signal-to-noise ratios, automation,  VST  support, internal  DSPs  and multi-effects, multi I/O cards support etc.). \n In 2005, FamiTracker, a tracker for the  NES  and Famicom, was officially released. As of version 0.5 beta, it is so far the only tracker for the system with full expansion audio support including the  Sunsoft 5B . \n Renoise , a popular tracker in the 2000s and 2010s. \n During 2007,  Renoise  and  OpenMPT  were presented in  Computer Music Magazine  as professional and inexpensive alternative to other music production software. [5] \n 2010s: Current state [ edit ] \n In 2010, Modplug Tracker ( OpenMPT ) and Renoise were two of the most popular and actively developed trackers. \n Four new trackers,  Aodix , Buz\u00e9, Radium, and SVArTracker, had extended the tracker concept with new features such as piano roll, tickless events, and graphical automation. \n The development of  Jeskola Buzz  was resumed and regularly updated until January 2016. [6] \n In 2011, DefleMask was released, a multi-system  chipmusic  tracker, supporting SEGA Genesis, SEGA Master System, Nintendo Game Boy, Yamaha's SMAF, among other systems. [7] \n Sonant Live  and  Bassoontracker  are two trackers running in the web browser. \n Adlib Tracker II has been steadily updated and has become  open source . [8] \n Terminology [ edit ] \n See also:  Module file \n There are several elements common to any tracker program: samples, notes, effects, tracks (or channels), patterns, and orders. \n A  sample  is a small digital sound file of an instrument, voice, or other sound effect. Most trackers allow a part of the sample to be looped, simulating a  sustain  of a note. \n A  note  designates the frequency at which the sample is played back. By increasing or decreasing the playback speed of a digital sample, the pitch is raised or lowered, simulating instrumental notes (e.g. C, C#, D, etc.). \n An  effect  is a special function applied to a particular note. These effects are then applied during playback through either hardware or software. Common tracker effects include volume,  portamento ,  vibrato ,  retrigger , and  arpeggio . \n A  track  (or  channel ) is a space where one sample is played back at a time. Whereas the original  Amiga  trackers only provided four tracks, the hardware limit, modern trackers can mix a virtually unlimited number of channels into one sound stream through software mixing. Tracks have a fixed number of \"rows\" on which notes and effects can be placed (most trackers lay out tracks in a vertical fashion). Tracks typically contain 64 rows and 16 beats, although the beats and tempo can be increased or decreased to the composer's taste. \n A basic drum set could thus be arranged by putting a bass drum at rows 0, 4, 8, 12 etc. of one track and putting some hihat at rows 2, 6, 10, 14 etc. of a second track. Of course bass and hats could be interleaved on the same track, if the samples are short enough. If not, the previous sample is usually stopped when the next one begins. Some modern trackers simulate  polyphony  in a single track by setting the \"new note action\" of each instrument to cut, continue,  fade  out, or  release , opening new mixing channels as necessary. \n A  pattern  is a group of simultaneously played tracks that represents a full section of the song. A pattern usually represents an even number of  measures  of music composition. \n An  order  is part of a sequence of patterns which defines the layout of a song. Patterns can be repeated across multiple orders to save tracking time and file space. \n There are also some tracker-like programs that utilize tracker-style sequencing schemes, while using real-time sound synthesis instead of samples. Many of these programs are designed for creating music for a particular synthesizer chip such as the OPL chips of the Adlib and SoundBlaster sound cards, or the sound chips of classic home computers. \n Tracker music is typically stored in  module files  where the song data and samples are encapsulated in a single file. Several module file formats are supported by popular music player programs such as  Winamp  or  XMMS . Well-known formats include  MOD ,  MED ,  S3M ,  XM  and  IT . Many of these formats can also be imported into existing trackers, allowing to view arrangement, instrumentation and the use of effect commands. This also makes the self-teaching of music composition using trackers easier and allows to extract instruments for later use in own songs, which was very common. [9] \n Use in professional music [ edit ] \n The  hardcore techno  scene has had many releases originally written using trackers and released on CD and vinyl. [10]  Notable artists include  Nasenbluten , Noisekick,  Neophyte  and  Deadmau5 . [11] [12] [13] \n Also in  video game soundtracks  tracker music was used by notable artists as  Andrew Sega ,  Alexander Brandon ,  Dan Gardop\u00e9e  and  Peter Hajba .  Video game developer   Nicklas Nygren  used  Fast Tracker 2  in his early works (e.g.  Knytt Stories [14] ) to compose the  video game music .
