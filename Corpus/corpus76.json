And \n Communicating what \u2013 practical steps we can take to put workable solutions around those elements \n An Economic Capital framework helps ensure that a financial institution remains safe and sound by capturing the risks to which a global portfolio is exposed, where it adequately capitalizes for those risks. Such frameworks typically rely on quantitative models and analytical tools, and work across multiple teams to capture qualitative elements that inform the risk view.\u00a0 By applying the three principles listed above, I continue to be able to construct a framework that captures the key risk drivers, both at a portfolio and unique deal level, understand and correctly apply the quantitative tools needed to analyze those risks, and develop and clearly articulate solutions that mitigate those risks. \n What do you value most from your Economics experience? \n The two things that I value most about economics are the multi-disciplinary aspect of it, and the insight it gave me into decision-making.\u00a0 Both of those aspects provided me with the incredible fuel with which I could grasp on to new and ever-changing topics, and rapidly gain insights and intuitions into those topics. \n Is there a particular memory that stands out from your time at Concordia? \n I particularly cherish my memories as they related to organized student life at Concordia.\u00a0 I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to be President of the Economic Graduate Students Association, and to participate in several CIREQ student conferences, as well as joining CIRANO as a student researcher.\u00a0 Those experiences were anchors that added significant color and depth to my overall student experience. \n What advice would you give to someone considering graduate studies in Economics? \n Economics provides an excellent avenue through which students can develop critical thinking, and a sense of underlying factors that drive the behaviour of a variety of actors in a complex system.\u00a0 Whether it be getting a strong sense of behaviour through microeconomics and/or game theory, understanding transmission mechanisms through macroeconomics, using statistical tools to capture dynamics through econometrics, or understanding how all of the above are used to put together workable policies, economics can provide you with the raw skills to tackle any number of issues, no matter how they come!\u00a0 So take advantage of this multi-disciplinary aspect of economics to explore and expand your knowledge-base.\u00a0 \n Alumni profiles Carlos A.
