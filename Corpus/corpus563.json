It is used for  maintenance of the Wikipedia project  and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not  articles , or it groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. \nThis is a  hidden category . It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding  user preference 'Show hidden categories'  is set. \n Articles in this category contain  statements that may become dated  originating from 2013. The statements may need to be updated, removed or edited for perspective. Articles containing older statements are more likely to be dated. This is  not  a backlog; not all articles in this category will need updating at this point in time. \n Use  {{ As of }}  to mark all individual statements that may become dated, this will automatically add them to the appropriate categories. Wherever possible, use  {{ Update after }}  to mark exactly when statements will need updating in addition to using  {{ As of }} . \n See also [ edit ] \n Special:Search/ \"as of 2013\"  for a more complete list. \n Wikipedia:As of  for details of dealing with statements that date quickly. \n Wikipedia:Avoid statements that will date quickly  for guidelines on using precise language when dealing with information that may date quickly. \n Category:Wikipedia articles in need of updating  and the accompanying  {{ Update after }}  template. \n Pages in category \"Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2013\" \n The following 200 pages are in this category, out of approximately 1,861 total.
