(\u201cToshl\u201d) governing your online and offline use of the software and collection of services (\u201cServices\u201d) offered by Toshl.com, its mobile applications, and related services (collectively the \u201cSite\u201d). \n Show non-binding sidenotes \n Hide non-binding sidenotes \n We\u2019ve added these side notes as help with the understanding of the legalese, perhaps even comic relief to help you from turning into a Kafkaesque cockroach before you get to the end. \n Keep in mind though that these are only comments, you are agreeing to the main legal text, NOT these side notes. \n By using the Site, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Site.  By clicking the \u201cI AGREE\u201d button or accessing or using any part of the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. \n To use Toshl you have to agree to these terms. \n Internet technology, and the applicable laws, rules and regulations change frequently. We reserve the right to make changes to these Terms of Service at any time.  Continued access and/or use of the Site in any manner constitutes assent to any existing and new Terms of Service  that may be posted on the Site. \n These terms can change, if they do, we\u2019ll post them here. \n 1. Toshl.com \n Toshl Finance is a service that helps people keep track of personal finances with apps on multiple mobile and desktop platforms. Know your finances.  Have fun! \n 2. Eligibility \n To be eligible to use the Site and sign up for any of its Services, you must be at least 13 years of age and eligible to form a binding contract in your country of residence.  \n You must be at least 13 to go on this Toshl ride. Not because there\u2019s anything especially kinky going on here, but because you need to be a certain age to be bound by contracts in most countries. \n 3. Free Toshl Account \n Toshl offers users the opportunity to register for a Free Toshl Account, which offers basic features to registered users free of charge.  To register and activate your Free Toshl Account, you must either:\n Provide  a unique password to access your account, a valid email address and the confirmation of it validity by clicking on a link sent by email; or \n Log-in using your: \n Google email address and Google+ profile in accordance with Google\u2019s  Terms of Service  and  Privacy Policy \n Facebook account in accordance with Facebook\u2019s Terms of Service and Data Use Policy; or \n When you register we\u2019ll need at least a valid email address and a password from you. \n If you log in with any of the third party services you need to be cool with their Terms and Privacy as well. \n 4. Upgrading Account to Toshl Pro \n At any time, users may opt to upgrade their account to become a Toshl Pro Member, which will enable additional and improved features (\u201cMember Services\u201d) not available to Free Toshl Account holders. \n You can register for free and use your free account as long as you want. \n We also offer an upgrade to Toshl Pro membership to get some nice extra features. \n Toshl Pro is a subscription. You can sign up for a monthly, yearly or 3-yearly one. If it expires and you haven\u2019t renewed, you\u2019re back to the free account. \n The subscription will usually automatically renew after the period is up. We\u2019ll send you an email to warn you before it does. You can cancel the automatic renewal at any time in the Settings. \n Sometimes we offer discounts, they\u2019re only valid for the first purchase, not the later renewals. \n To become a Toshl Pro Member:\n Toshl Pro Members must first pay a monthly, annual or 3-year subscription fee (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d), which allows Toshl Pro Member\u2019s use of the Services during the applicable subscription period. \n Payment of the Subscription Fee creates a recurring payment obligation.  Toshl Pro Member subscriptions will be automatically renewed, unless the Toshl Pro Member terminates the Member Services prior to its expiration.  Toshl will notify the Toshl Pro Member of the impending subscription renewal and fee by email prior to the subscription renewal date. \n When upgrading to Toshl Pro, Toshl may offer promotional discounts on the price of its Subscription Fee. Such discounts are valid only for the first subscription period .  Subsequent subscriptions will be subject to Toshl\u2019s standard Toshl Pro Member Subscription Fee for the applicable subscription period. \n 30-Day Money Back Guarantee:  Toshl Pro Members may terminate their initial subscription at any time during the first 30 days following payment of the Subscription Fee (\u201cTrial Period\u201d).  In the event of termination during the Trial Period, Toshl Pro Members who subscribe on a monthly or annual subscription basis are entitled to a full refund of the Subscription Fee. Toshl Pro Members who subscribe to a 3-year subscription will receive a refund of the Subscription Fee, less the cost of the Toshl T-shirt and related shipping costs. \n If you cancel within the first 30 days and it\u2019s your first time with Toshl Pro we\u2019ll refund your money automatically. \n With iOS and Windows Phone in-app purchases, we sadly don\u2019t get the direct control over the refunds, so their support service needs to be contacted too. They usually comply just fine, if not we\u2019ll work something out. \n If you get the 3-year plan with the T-shirt, you can\u2019t get the same 30-day refund, because we already sent you the T-shirt. If you want the refund, we\u2019ll deduct the T-shirt price and shipping. \n 5. Account Integrity and Security \n In establishing either a Toshl Free or Toshl Pro Member account, you represent that all registration information is truthful and accurate, and you agree to maintain the accuracy of such information. \n You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any passwords associated with your account.   You must notify Toshl immediately if you believe your password or account has been obtained or may be accessed or used by any unauthorized person or entity. \n You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all use and activities that occur under your account. \n You\u2019re responsible to keep your password secret and follow good security practices. \n If the shit hits the fan, let us know right away so we can try to help you. \n 6. Terminating Subscriptions \n Toshl Pro Members may choose to terminate their subscription to Member Services by: \n Terminating the automatic subscription renewal.  By exercising this option, Toshl Pro Members will be able to continue to use the Member Services until the expiration of their subscription.  At the expiration of the subscription, Toshl Pro Members will then revert to a Free Toshl Account, and will no longer have access to additional features and improvements provided to Toshl Pro Members; or \n Deleting your account.  Deleting your existing account will cancel the subscription to Member Services, the automatic renewal and all data associated with the Toshl Pro Member Account.  To access Services offered through a Toshl Free Account, users will have to register for a new account. \n You can cancel the automatic subscription renewal whenever you want. Toshl Pro will still be valid until the original expiration date. \n You can also delete the account, which will also stop the automatic renewal and also delete all your data. \n If a user terminates their account after the 30-Day Trial Period, Toshl Pro Members will not be entitled to a refund of any portion of the Subscription Fee paid. \n We won\u2019t give you partial refunds if you cancel after the 30-day trial period. \n 7.
