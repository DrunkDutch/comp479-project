[1] \n A  permissive software license , sometimes also called  BSD-like  or  BSD-style  license, [2]  is a  free software   software licence  with minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed. Examples include the  MIT Licence ,  BSD licences ,  Apple Public Source License  and the  Apache licence . As of 2016, [update]  the most popular free software license is the permissive MIT license.

[5]   GitHub 's  choosealicense  website described the MIT permissive license as, \"lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide  attribution  back to you and don\u2019t hold you  liable .\" [6]   California Western School of Law 's newmediarights.com defined them as follows: \"The \u2018BSD-like\u2019 licenses such as the BSD, MIT, and Apache licenses are extremely permissive, requiring little more than attributing the original portions of the licensed code to the original developers in your own code and/or documentation.\". [2] \n Other terms [ edit ] \n Copycenter [ edit ] \n Copycenter  is a term originally used to explain the  modified BSD licence , a permissive free software license. The term was presented by  Kirk McKusick , a  computer scientist  famous for his work on BSD, during one of his speeches at  BSDCon  1999. It is a  word play  on  copyright ,  copyleft  and  copy center . \n The way it was characterized politically, you had copyright, which is what the big companies use to lock everything up; you had copyleft, which is free software's way of making sure they can't lock it up; and then  Berkeley  had what we called \u2018copycenter\u2019, which is \u2018take it down to the copy center and make as many copies as you want.\u2019 \n \u2014\u2009 Kirk McKusick ,  BSDCon  1999 [7] \n The liberty to 'make as many copies as you want' is in fact also provided by all copyleft licenses. However, unlike both copyleft licenses and copyright law, permissive free software licenses do not control the license terms that a derivative work falls under. \n Comparison to public domain [ edit ] \n Further information:  Public domain software  and  Public domain like license \n CC0 , copyright  waiver  and copyfree license [8] \n Computer Associates Int'l v. Altai  used the term \"public domain\" to refer to works that have become widely shared and distributed under permission, rather than work that was deliberately put into the public domain. However, permissive licenses are not actually equivalent to releasing a work into the  public domain . \n Permissive licenses often do stipulate some limited requirements, such as that the original authors must be credited ( attribution ). If a work is truly in the public domain, this is usually not legally required, but a United States  copyright registration  requires disclosing material that has been previously published, [9]  and attribution may still be considered an ethical requirement in  academia . \n Comparison to copyleft [ edit ] \n Further information:  Copyleft \n A major difference between the set of permissive and copyleft free software licenses is that when the software is being redistributed (either modified or unmodified), permissive licenses don't enforce the redistributor to open the modified source code.  Copyleft  (\"sharealike\") licenses enforce the publication of the source code under the copyleft license. [10] [11]  Some people argue that copyleft licenses see the world as \"evil\" and therefore enforce \"freedoms\" (\"availability of source code\") while permissive licenses see the world as \"good\", therefore just allowing good actions and hoping for giving back in form of source code. [12]  Permissive licenses don't try to guarantee that future generations of the software will remain free and publicly available, in contrast to licenses which have reciprocity / share-alike requirements which try to enforce this. \n The  FreeBSD  project argues on the advantages of permissive licenses for companies and commercial use-cases: they place only  \"minimal restrictions on future behavior\"  and aren't  \"legal time-bombs\" , unlike copyleft licenses. [13] \n Also permissive licenses have often an excellent  licence compatibility , [14] [15]  in comparison to copyleft licenses who can't be always freely combined and mixed. [16] [17]  However, most GPLv2 licensed software allows to upgrade to the terms of later versions of the GPL, achieving by that a somewhat better inter-GPL compatibility. Also, some copyleft licenses have exception clauses that allow combining them with software that is under different licenses or license versions. [18] \n License compatibility [ edit ] \n Main article:  License compatibility \nLicense compatibility between common  FOSS   software licences  according to  David A. Wheeler  (2007): the vector arrows denote a one directional compatibility, therefore better compatibility on the left side (\"permissive licenses\") than on the right side (\"copyleft licences\"). [19] \n In general permissive licenses show a good  licence compatibility  with most other software licenses in most situations. [14] [15] \n Due to their non-restrictiveness most permissive software licenses are even compatible with copyleft licenses, which are incompatible with most other licenses. Copyleft licenses don't allow the addition of additional restrictive clauses which would be often required in a combined work made from copyleft code and other licensed code. Only some older permissive licenses have clauses requiring advertising materials to credit the copyright holder which made them incompatible with copyleft licenses, for instance the  4-clause BSD license , the  PHP Licence , and the  OpenSSL License . Popular modern permissive licenses, as the  MIT Licence , the 3-clause  BSD licence , and the  Zlib Licence , don't include advertising clauses and are compatible with many copyleft licenses. \n Some licenses do not allow derived works to add a restriction that says a redistributor cannot add more restrictions. Examples include the  CDDL  and  MsPL . However such restrictions also make the license incompatible with permissive free software licenses. \n Some licenses are permissive but do not qualify as free software licenses as defined by the  Free Software Foundation . \n Reception and adoption [ edit ] \n While always an important part of the FOSS license landscape, in the 2010s years several authors noted a raising popularity of the permissive licenses in contrast to the copyleft license. [20] [21] [22] [23] \n As of 2015, [update]  the MIT licence, a permissive license, is the most popular license in the FOSS domain before a copyleft one, the second placed  GPLv2 .

GPL Advantages and Disadvantages [..] 12. Conclusion \nIn contrast to the GPL, which is designed to prevent the proprietary commercialization of Open Source code, the BSD license places minimal restrictions on future behavior. This allows BSD code to remain Open Source or become integrated into commercial solutions, as a project's or company's needs change. In other words, the BSD license does not become a legal time-bomb at any point in the development process. \nIn addition, since the BSD license does not come with the legal complexity of the GPL or LGPL licenses, it allows developers and companies to spend their time creating and promoting good code rather than worrying if that code violates licensing. \u00a0 \n ^  a   b   \"Licence Compatibility\" .

Permissive licenses (BSD, MIT, X11, Apache, Zope) are generally compatible and interoperable with most other licenses, tolerating to merge, combine or improve the covered code and to re-distribute it under many licenses (including non-free or \u201cproprietary\u201d). \u00a0 \n ^  a   b   Hanwell, Marcus D.

Permissive licensing simplifies things One reason the business world, and more and more developers [...], favor permissive licenses is in the simplicity of reuse. The license usually only pertains to the source code that is licensed and makes no attempt to infer any conditions upon any other component, and because of this there is no need to define what constitutes a derived work. I have also never seen a license compatibility chart for permissive licenses; it seems that they are all compatible. \u00a0 \n ^   \"Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses\u00a0\u2013 Is GPLv3 compatible with GPLv2?\" . gnu.org . Retrieved  2014-06-03 .  No. Some of the requirements in GPLv3, such as the requirement to provide Installation Information, do not exist in GPLv2. As a result, the licenses are not compatible: if you tried to combine code released under both these licenses, you would violate section 6 of GPLv2. However, if code is released under GPL \"version 2 or later,\" that is compatible with GPLv3 because GPLv3 is one of the options it permits. \u00a0 \n ^   Landley, Rob.  \"CELF 2013 Toybox talk\" .  landley.net .
