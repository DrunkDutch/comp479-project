We try to offer opportunities to work closely as part of a research team to as many of our graduate students as possible, and through teaching assistantships, some students work closely with professors to further develop their professional skills. \n The\u00a0 Graduate Student Resource Center \u00a0is a space dedicated exclusively to our graduate students, offering them a place to make and call their own. \n Doctoral program \n Education (PhD) \n Masters' programs \n Applied Linguistics (MA) \n Child Studies (MA) \n Educational Studies (MA) \n Educational Technology (MA) \n Graduate diplomas \n Instructional Technology   (Diploma) \n Adult Education   (Diploma) \n Certificate programs \n TESL: Teaching English as Second Language (Certificate) \n Adult Education   (Certificate) \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About the Faculty \n Academics \n Research & graduate studies \n Student services \n Alumni \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
