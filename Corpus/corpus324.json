The  proposed amendments would allow credit ratings of a Canadian office of a DRO to  continue to be used for regulatory purposes in the EU. \n To ensure that NI  25-101 continues to reflect the International Organization of Securities  Commissions (IOSCO)  Code of Conduct  Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies  (the Code), the proposed amendments  also reflect new provisions in the March 2015 version of the Code.  \n \u201cThe IOSCO Code  offers a robust framework to protect the integrity of the credit rating  process, ensure investors and issuers are treated fairly, and safeguard  confidential information that rated issuers provide to credit rating  organizations,\u201d said Louis Morisset, CSA Chair and President and CEO of the  Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers. \u201cWe believe it is important that Canadian  rules reflect the high standards of the IOSCO Code.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \n CSA staff are  also proposing to amend  National Instrument 44-101  Short Form Prospectus Distributions  and  National Instrument 44-102  Shelf Distributions  to recognize the  credit ratings of Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (Kroll), but only for the purposes  of the alternative eligibility criteria for issuers of asset-backed securities  to file a short form prospectus or shelf prospectus, respectively. The proposed  amendments also address other matters. \n Kroll would only  be designated as a DRO if the proposed rule amendments are enacted as final  rule amendments and come into effect following any necessary Ministerial  approvals. At this time, CSA staff do not anticipate proposing that Kroll be  designated as a DRO for purposes of other credit rating provisions in  securities rules and policies.  \n Stakeholders are  invited to submit their comments in writing by October 4, 2017.  \n The notice and  request for comment can be found on CSA members\u2019 websites. \nThe CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada\u2019s provinces  and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian  capital markets. \n - 30 - \n For more information: \n Kristen\n            Rose \n            Ontario Securities Commission \n            416-593-2336 \n Hilary McMeekin \n            Alberta Securities Commission \n            403-592-8186 \n Alison Walker \n            British Columbia Securities Commission \n            604-899-6713  \n            Sylvain Th\u00e9berge \n            Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers \n            514-940-2176\n Jason (Jay) Booth \n            Manitoba Securities Commission \n            204-945-1660 \n Andrew\n            Nicholson \n            Financial and Consumer Services \n            Commission, New Brunswick \n            506-658-3021\n David Harrison \n            Nova Scotia Securities Commission \n            902-424-8586\n            Janice Callbeck \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            P.E.I \n            902-368-6288\n            John O\u2019Brien \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            Newfoundland and Labrador \n            709-729-4909\n            Rhonda Horte \n            Office of the Yukon Superintendent \n            of Securities \n            867-667-5466\n            Jeff Mason \n            Nunavut Securities Office \n            867-975-6591 \n Tom\n            Hall \n            Northwest Territories Securities Office \n            867-767-9305\n            Shannon McMillan \n            Financial and Consumer Affairs \n            Authority of Saskatchewan \n            306-798-4160\n Contact  | \n                                     Legal  |\n                                     Legislation  |\n                                     Accessibility  |\n                                     Fran\u00e7ais \n \u00a9 Ontario Securities Commission 2017 \n Government of Ontario \n JavaScript is disabled or not supported by this browser.
