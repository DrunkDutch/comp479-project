It publishes news, reviews, and guides on issues such as  computer hardware  and  software , science,  technology policy , and video games. Many of the site's writers are postgraduates and some work for  research institutions . Articles on the website are written in a less-formal tone than those in traditional journals. \n Ars Technica  was privately owned until May 2008, when it was sold to  Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital , the online division of Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications. Cond\u00e9 Nast purchased the site, along with two others, for $25 million and added it to the company's  Wired  Digital group, which also includes  Wired  and, formerly,  Reddit . The staff mostly works from home and has offices in  Boston ,  Chicago ,  London ,  New York City , and  San Francisco . \n The operations of  Ars Technica  are funded primarily by  online advertising , and it has offered a paid subscription service since 2001. The website generated controversy in 2010, when it experimentally prevented readers who used  advertisement-blocking  software from viewing the site. \n Contents \n 1   History \n 2   Content \n 3   Staff \n 4   Revenue \n 4.1   Advertisement block \n 5   See also \n 6   Notes \n 7   References \n 8   External links \n 9   Further reading \n History [ edit ] \n Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes created the  Ars Technica   website  and  limited liability company  in 1998. [3] [4]  Its purpose was to publish  computer hardware - and  software -related news articles and guides; [5]  in their words, \"the best multi- OS ,  PC  hardware, and tech coverage possible while\u00a0... having fun, being productive, and being as informative and as accurate as possible\". [6]  \"Ars technica\" is a  Latin  phrase that translates to \"technological art\". [5]  The website published news, reviews, guides, and other content of interest to computer enthusiasts. Writers for  Ars Technica  were geographically distributed across the United States at the time; Fisher lived in his parents' house in  Boston ,  Massachusetts , Stokes in  Chicago ,  Illinois , and the other writers in their respective cities. [4] [7] \n On May 19, 2008,  Ars Technica  was sold to Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital, the online division of  Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications . [a]  The sale was part of a purchase by Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital of three unaffiliated websites costing $25 million in total:  Ars Technica ,  Webmonkey , and  HotWired .  Ars Technica  was added to the company's  Wired  Digital group, which included  Wired  and  Reddit . In an interview with  The New York Times , Fisher said other companies offered to buy  Ars Technica  and the site's writers agreed to a deal with Cond\u00e9 Nast because they felt it offered them the best chance to turn their \"hobby\" into a business. [9]  Fisher, Stokes, and the eight other writers at the time were employed by Cond\u00e9 Nast, with Fisher as  editor-in-chief . [5] [10]  Layoffs at Cond\u00e9 Nast in November 2008 affected websites owned by the company \"across the board\", including  Ars Technica . [11] \n On May 5, 2015,  Ars Technica  launched its United Kingdom site to expand its coverage of issues related to the U.K. and Europe. [12]  The UK site began with around 500,000 readers and had reached roughly 1.4 million readers a year after its launch. [13]  In September 2017, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced that it was significantly downsizing its  Ars Technica  U.K. arm, and laid off all but one member of its permanent editorial staff. [14] \n Content [ edit ] \n The content of articles published by  Ars Technica  has generally remained the same since its creation in 1998 and are categorized by four types: news, guides, reviews, and features. News articles relay current events.  Ars Technica  also hosts OpenForum, a free  Internet forum  for the discussion of a variety of topics. \n Originally, most news articles published by the website were relayed from other technology-related websites.  Ars Technica  provided short commentary on the news, generally a few paragraphs, and a link to the original source. After being purchased by Cond\u00e9 Nast,  Ars Technica  began publishing more original news, investigating topics, and interviewing sources themselves. A significant portion of the news articles published there now are original. Relayed news is still published on the website, ranging from one or two sentences to a few paragraphs. \n Ars Technica ' s features are long articles that go into great depth on their subject. [15] [16]  For example, the site published a guide on  CPU   architecture  in 1998 named \"Understanding CPU caching and performance\". [17]  An article in 2009 discussed in detail the  theory ,  physics ,  mathematical proofs , and applications of  quantum computers . [18]  The website's 18,000-word review of  Apple Inc. 's  iPad  described everything from the product's packaging to the specific type of  integrated circuits  it uses. [19] \n Ars Technica  is written in a less-formal tone than that found in a traditional journal. [20] [21]  Many of the website's regular writers have postgraduate degrees, and many work for academic or private  research institutions . Website cofounder Jon Stokes published the computer architecture textbook  Inside The Machine  in 2007; [22]  John Timmer performed  postdoctoral research  in  developmental neurobiology ; [20]  Timothy Lee is a scholar at the  Cato Institute , a  public-policy institute , which has republished  Ars Technica  articles by him. [23] [24]  Biology journal  Disease Models & Mechanisms  called  Ars Technica  a \"conduit between researchers and the public\" in 2008. [25] \n On September 12, 2012,  Ars Technica  recorded its highest daily traffic ever with its  iPhone 5  event coverage. It recorded 15.3 million  page views , 13.2 million of which came from its live blog platform of the event. [26] \n Staff [ edit ] \n John Timmer is the science editor for  Ars. [27]  He also teaches  scientific writing  and  science journalism  at Stony Brook University and Weill Cornell Medical College. [28] [29] \n He earned his undergraduate degree from  Columbia University  and his PhD from  University of California, Berkeley  and worked as a postdoc at  Memorial Sloan Kettering . [27] [30]  During his postdoc, he started losing interest in practicing science, and started writing  freelance  articles about science, including for  Ars . [31] [30]  In 2008, when  Conde Nast  bought  Ars , he became the site's full-time science editor. [27] \n Revenue [ edit ] \n The cost of operating  Ars Technica  has always been funded primarily by  online advertising . [32]  Originally handled by Federated Media Publishing, selling advertising space on the website is now managed by Cond\u00e9 Nast. [10]  In addition to online advertising,  Ars Technica  has sold subscriptions to the website since 2001, now named Ars Premier subscriptions. Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and receive benefits including the ability to see exclusive articles, post in certain areas of the  Ars Technica  forum, and participate in live  chat rooms  with notable people in the computer industry. [33]  To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by  IBM , [32]  and the site's Exploring  Datacenters  section is sponsored by  data-management  company  NetApp . In the past,  Ars Technica  collected  shared revenue  from  affiliate marketing  by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of  Ars Technica -branded merchandise. [34] \n Advertisement block [ edit ] \n On March 5, 2010,  Ars Technica  experimentally blocked readers who used  Adblock Plus \u2014one of several computer programs that stop advertisements from being displayed in a  web browser \u2014from viewing the website. Fisher estimated 40% of the website's readers had the software installed at the time. The next day, the block was lifted, and the article \"Why  Ad Blocking  is devastating to the sites you love\" was published on  Ars Technica , persuading readers not to use the software on websites they care about: [32] [35] \n ...\u00a0blocking ads can be devastating to the sites you love. I am not making an argument that blocking ads is a form of stealing, or is immoral, or unethical\u00a0... It can result in people losing their jobs, it can result in less content on any given site, and it definitely can affect the quality of content. It can also put sites into a real advertising death spin. \n The block and article were controversial, generating articles on other websites about them, and the broader issue of advertising ethics. [36] [37]  Readers of  Ars Technica  generally followed Fisher's persuasion; the day after his article was published, 25,000 readers who used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on  Ars Technica  in their browser, and 200 readers had subscribed to Ars Premier. [32] \n In February 2016, Fisher noted, \"That article lowered the ad-block rate by 12 percent, and what we found was that the majority of people blocking ads on our site were doing it because other sites were irritating them.\" In response to an increasing use of ad blockers,  Ars Technica  intends to [update]  identify readers who filter out advertisements and ask them to support the site by several means.
