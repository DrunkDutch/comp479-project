See schedule    \t55 - Boulevard Saint-Laurent   Bus route extension to Henri-Bourassa station.     Ouvrir la section:  To learn more     Starting next August 28, the 55 \u2013 Boulevard Saint-Laurent bus line will be improved as its route will be extended to Henri-Bourassa station. This change eliminates the need for transfers between the 55 and 53 bus lines, in addition to providing an uninterrupted bus link with the Orange line along boulevard Saint-Laurent. Access to Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough, specifically the Chabanel area, will also be easier.   See schedule   Close      \t170 - Keller\u00a0   New terminus stop at the corner of Jean-Bourdon and Louis-Jadon to improve access for the residents of this area.   See schedule    \t178 - Pointe-Nord / \u00cele-des-Soeurs\u00a0   Extended bus route on Nuns\u2019 Island.     Ouvrir la section:  To learn more     Starting August 28, 2017, the route taken by the 178 \u2013 Pointe-Nord/\u00cele-des-S\u0153urs will be extended to run along Place du Commerce, chemin du Golf, boulevard Marguerite-Bourgeoys and boulevard de l\u2019\u00cele-des-S\u0153urs in both directions. Furthermore, the bus line\u2019s operating hours will be expanded from 6\u00a0am to 9\u00a0pm, with buses running more frequently during rush hour.   Thanks to these improvements, our customers on Nuns\u2019 Island will enjoy an enhanced transit experience with better access to services, less complicated routes and enhanced service to and from downtown, as well as better service on week nights.   The map below provides an overview of the new bus route:   S ee map     See schedule   Close      449 - Express Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies  \tet 428 - Express parcs industriels de l'est\u00a0   A simplified route for the 449 bus line and creation of the 428 bus line.     Ouvrir la section:  To learn more     With a view to providing its customers with better service, we created the new 428 bus line to exclusively serve the industrial parks in the east end of Montr\u00e9al during rush hour.\u00a0Transit users in the area will also appreciate the 449 bus line\u2019s simplified route, as it will now run in both directions on boulevard Perras throughout the day and ending at the Gare Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies. Moreover, the 428 bus line will be an alternative for those who use the 28 \u2013 Honor\u00e9-Beaugrand bus line to go in the industrial parks area.   See the map below for an overview of the new bus routes:   See map \u00a0     Such service enhancements mean a number of benefits for area residents and workers, including:   A faster route for commuters riding the 449 bus   Direct access to both industrial parks from Radisson station   Fewer stops between work and home   An additional option to go to the industrial parks area (428)   These new changes will take effect August 28, 2017.
