The format is widely used because of its broad compatibility and flexible feature set. While some simple actions like viewing, merging, and digital signing of pdf files is possible with free software, more complex editing will require the purchase of Adobe Acrobat. This guide will cover some of the more basic use cases for reading, creating, and editing .pdf files. \n Steps Edit \n Part One of Four: Creating and Editing PDF Files Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/05\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/05\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Determine how you will be using PDF files.  For complex editing and manipulation of PDF files, you will need to purchase Adobe Acrobat. If you just want to be able to open or export existing files as PDF files, then there are free options.\n Acrobat Reader, Foxit Reader, or Windows Reader App are a few free options for viewing .pdf files. \n You can create a document in a word processor like Word, or Google Docs and save it as .pdf file, but further manipulation of that PDF will not be possible without Acrobat. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 2 \n Create a PDF file from an existing file.  Open Adobe Acrobat and press  Tools > Create PDF . This is where you start when importing files to turn into a PDF or starting a new PDF from scratch.\n There are a number of import options to choose from, including importing a single or multiple files, a scanned file, a webpage, or the contents of your clipboard.\n Adobe limits its file support to Microsoft Office (2007 and later) or OpenOffice filetypes, as well as basic text (.txt, .rtf), image files, or other adobe products. \n Selecting a file will create a PDF copy of that file in the same location on your computer as the original file. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c5\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c5\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n Edit text in the imported file.  With the file now opened, press \u201cEdit PDF\u201d and select a highlighted box of text. You can either type out the changes you want or utilize the options in the Format section.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4f\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4f\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Edit images in the imported file.

Pressing the Insert tool reveals a menu with options similar to new PDF creation: \u201cInsert from File\u201d, \u201cWebpage\u201d, \u201cScanner\u201d, \u201cClipboard\u201d, or \u201cBlank Page\u201d. Any selection will add the new page to the end of the document.\n This menu can also be accessed from the \u201c+\u201d button next to any of the page thumbnails. This method will insert the new page in this location. \n You may insert any filetype supported by Acrobat. It will be integrated into the .pdf like importing any other file. \n Free users can still merge PDF files using a variety of online services. Typically the process involves uploading each file to the site, selecting the order, and downloading the merged file.\n In this case, usually all of the files must already be in the PDF format in order to be merged. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-9.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-9.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-9.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-9.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 5 \n Replace an existing page.  Click the thumbnail of the page you want to replace and press the \u201cReplace\u201d button. Browse to the location of the desired replacement page, select it, and press \"OK\" to confirm the page replacement.\n Multiple pages can be replaced with your page selection by selecting a page range from the box prior to confirmation. \n Note, the replacement page must be an Acrobat supported filetype. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c1\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-10.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-10.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c1\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-10.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-10.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 6 \n Rearrange the pages.  Select the thumbnail(s) of the page(s) you want to move and simply drag and drop them to the preferred location in the PDF. A blue line will indicate the area that you have selected to place them before dropping them.\n You can also select specific page ranges, or other options like all even/odd pages, from the \u201cSelect Page Range\u201d menu. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/92\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-11.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-11.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/92\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-11.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-11.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 7 \n Extract pages from a PDF.

There are a variety of tools to manipulate the form fields to ensure the digital form is just as accurate as a physical copy.\n If you want to add more fields, you can select the area and choose the desired type of field from the panel on the right. \n Signature fields that are not obviously defined can be missed by Acrobat\u2019s auto-scan. In the toolbar press the \u201cDigital Signature\u201d button to add one manually. Click and drag to select the area of the form you want to add a digital signature field. \n Existing fields can be easily edited by right-clicking (ctrl-click on Mac) a field and selecting  Properties\u2026 > Options . \n Any unwanted field can be removed with right-click > Delete. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a0\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-14.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-14.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a0\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-14.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-14.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n Preview the changes.  You can test your changes at any time by pressing the Preview button and filling out the form.\n Notice that the Preview button changes to Edit when you press it. This is because you have exited editing mode. You must re-enter editing mode to make further changes or complete your form. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-15.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-15.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-15.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-15.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Complete your form.

The recipient of a fillable form will need to have some kind of PDF viewing software in order to open a fillable form. Most free options, including Adobe Reader, will allow users to complete fillable forms.\n For signatures, the most comprehensive solution Adobe Reader. When opening the file, Adobe Reader will detect the signature field and prompt the user to add a signature. The user can scan or capture an image of their digital signature, draw a signature with the mouse, or type the name and allow the software to make a digital approximation. \n Advertisement \n Part Four of Four: Working with PDF Security Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e9\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-17.jpg\\/v4-460px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-17.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e9\\/Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-17.jpg\\/v4-760px-Work-With-PDF-Files-Step-17.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Add a password to restrict viewing access.

Click on it when you get the results of your search. Now drag your .pdf file onto the Google Drive page  to upload the file. This may take awhile, depending on the file's size. When it's done uploading, click once on the file to highlight it, then flick on \"More\"..then \"Open With\"...then \"Google Docs\". When it's done opening, you can download the file to your computer by clicking on \"File\", then \"Download As\", and choose \"Microsoft Word\". That's it! \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 0 \n How can I download a .pdf in my iPhone? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n One way you can achieve this is to email the .pdf file to yourself and open the Mail app on your phone. You can tap the document and once you're viewing the document, tap the icon that looks like a square with an arrow inside of it pointing down. (If you can't see the icon, make sure the .pdf is open and tap the screen once to make the file name at the top appear.) Through this icon, you can save it as a .pdf to your phone. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 0 \n How can I create text in a PDF document? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n You can't create text in a PDF document. A PDF file is essentially a picture of text. You need to go back to the original document to change it. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 0 \n Can other pdf documents be inserted into a pdf file? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Yes, you can do this a couple of ways, but you will need the full version of Adobe Pro, or something similar. First, you can save a spreadsheet or word document as a PDF.  Once you save this as a PDF open the Tools and select \"Import Pages.\"\nA different option is to open a blank PDF. In the upper left corner, click on \"Create\" which opens a drop down window. From there, click on \"PDF Portfolio\". This basically opens a folder and you can add other documents to this including; PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, PowerPoints, Images, etc. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 0 \n I need to transfer an email PDF document into one I can type on.
