User agents include HTML browsers and other types\nof software that retrieve and render  Web content . A user agent that\n conforms  to these guidelines will\npromote accessibility through its own user interface and through other internal\nfacilities, including its ability to communicate with other technologies\n(especially  assistive technologies ).\nFurthermore, all users, not just users with disabilities, should find\nconforming user agents to be more usable. \n In addition to helping developers of HTML browsers and media players, this\ndocument will also benefit developers of assistive technologies because it\nexplains what types of information and control an assistive technology may\nexpect from a conforming user agent. Technologies not addressed directly by\nthis document (e.g., technologies for braille rendering) will be essential to\nensuring Web access for some users with disabilities. \n Status of this document \n This section describes the status of this document at the time of its\npublication. Other documents may supersede this document. The latest status of\nthis document series is maintained at the W3C. \n This is the 17 December 2002 Recommendation of \"User Agent Accessibility\nGuidelines 1.0.\" This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, the disability\ncommunity, software developers, and other W3C groups and interested parties,\nand has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable\ndocument and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative\nreference from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to\ndraw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment.\nThis enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. \n This document was produced by the  User\nAgent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group  ( UAWG ). The\ngoals of the UAWG are described in\n UAWG charter . The\ncomplete  list of\nchanges  to this document is available on the Web. \n The UAWG also provides additional resources to support this document (e.g.,\n Frequently Asked Questions\n(FAQ) about UAAG 1.0 , implementation reports, and test suites). Please\nconsult the  UAWG  home page for more\ninformation. \n Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on the\nWorking Group's  patent disclosure page  in\nconformance with W3C policy. \n The list of  errata  for\nthis document is available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/UAAG-errata.
