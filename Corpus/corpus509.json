It has been used in various languages, including English and Japanese since the early 1900s as a means by which members of the LGBT community can identify themselves and speak in code with brevity and speed to other LGBTs.

[2] [3] [4] \n Cultural research [ edit ] \n Since the advent of  queer studies  in universities, LGBT slang and argot has become a subject of academic research among  linguistic anthropology  scholars. [5] \n Cultural impact [ edit ] \n Many terms that originated as gay slang have become part of the popular  lexicon . For example, the word  drag  was popularized by  Hubert Selby, Jr.  in his book  Last Exit to Brooklyn . \"Drag\" has been traced back by the  Oxford English Dictionary  (OED) to the late 19th Century. Conversely, words such as  banjee , while well-established in a subset of gay society, have never made the transition to popular use. \n English [ edit ] \n The examples and perspective in this section  deal primarily with the United Kingdom and do not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject .

For example, in the 1960s and 1970s the terms \"cottage\" (UK) and \"tearoom\" (US) were used to denote public toilets used for sex. By 1999, this terminology had fallen out of use to the point of being greatly unrecognisable by members of the LGBT community at large. [6] \n United Kingdom [ edit ] \n During the first seven decades of the 20th century, a specific form of  Polari  was developed by gay men and lesbians in urban centres with established LGBT communities. [7] [8] \n Although there are differences, modern gay slang has adopted many Polari words, as detailed in the table below: \n Source:  Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang [9] \n Glossary of gay slang taken from Polari \n Word \n Approximate meaning \n basket \n the bulge of male genitals visible through clothing \n bear \n a large, often hairy man \n bumming \n the act of anal sex \n chicken /fox/ twink \n young man \n cottaging \n having or looking for sex in a public toilet \n cub \n a young bear \n gym bunny/Muscle Mary \n A person who works out merely for aesthetics \n Hada \n Blow-Job \n Kuda \n speaking \n howdy \n touching another male/female's behind \n Uros \n Anal Sex \n wolf \n a man who tends to fall evenly between a fox/twink and a bear/cub \n zhoosh \n style \n twink \n usually young or young-looking, bodily-hairless man \n North America [ edit ] \n The 1964 legislative report  Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida  contains an extensive appendix documenting and defining the homosexual slang of the time. \n Scruff launched a Gay Slang Dictionary app in January 2014. [10]  It includes commonly used slang in the United States from the gay community. Some of these cross over with the British slang, and some are only American. \n Source:  Scruff - Gay Slang Dictionary [11] \n Glossary of U.S. gay slang taken from Scruff \n Word \n Approximate meaning \n bear \n a large, often hairy man \n bear chaser \n a man who pursues bears \n bottom \n the receptive sexual partner, receives rather than gives \n Cub \n typically heavier, hairier, and younger gay man. \n daddy \n typically an older financially established gay man \n discreet \n gay man who is reserved, private, or secretive about his identity \n kink \n non-standard sexual activity, fetish, or interest. \n NSA \n no strings attached; casual sex. \n otter \n thinner, hairier gay man \n poz \n HIV positive person \n top \n the inserting sexual partner, gives rather than receives \n twink \n a small, often bodily-hairless guy \n H.

[2]  Although the literal English translation of  okoge  is  burnt rice that sticks to the bottom of a pot,  it is a reference to the Japanese equivalent to \"faggot\",  okama  (\u5fa1\u91dc, \u304a\u91dc, or \u5fa1\u7ac8; pot).
