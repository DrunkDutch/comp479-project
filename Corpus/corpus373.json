Since 2012, Russia maintains a centralized internet blacklist (known as the  \"single register\" ) maintained by the  Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media  ( Roskomnadzor ). The list is used for the  censorship  of individual  URLs ,  domain names , and  IP addresses . It was originally introduced to block sites that contain materials advocating  drug abuse  and  drug production , descriptions of suicide methods, and containing  child pornography . It was subsequently amended to allow the blocking of materials that are classified as  extremist , call for illegal meetings, or contain other content deemed illegal. [1]  These regulations have been frequently abused to block criticism of the federal government or local administration. [2] [3]  A law prohibiting \"abuse of mass media freedom\" implements a process for the shutting down of online media outlets.

[4] \n Russia was on  Reporters Without Borders  list of countries under surveillance from 2010 to 2013 [5]  and was moved to the Internet Enemies list in 2014. [6] \n Freedom House  deems Russia \"not free\" with a score of 65/100 (100 being less free) in its 2016  Freedom on the Net  report. [3] \n Since at least 2015, Russia collaborates with Chinese  Great Firewall  security officials in implementing its data retention and filtering infrastructure. [7] \n Agencies [ edit ] \nEmblem of  Roskomnadzor \n Media in the Russian Federation, including the internet, is regulated by  Roskomnadzor  ( Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications ) ,  a branch of the  Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communcations . \n Roskomnadzor, along with several other agencies such as the  Federal Drug Control Service , the  Federal Consumer Protection Service , and the office of the  Prosecutor General , can block certain classes of content without a court order: Calls for unsanctioned public actions, content deemed extremist, materials that violate copyright, information about juvenile victims of crime, child abuse imagery, information encouraging the use of drugs, and descriptions of suicide. [8]  Other content can be blocked with a court order. [8] \n Internet service providers  (ISPs) are held legally responsible for any illegal content that is accessible to their users (intermediary liability). [8] \n History [ edit ] \n Developments 2004\u20132012 [ edit ] \n In 2004 only a minority of Russians (8% of the population) had Internet access. [9]  In May 2008, some 32.7 million users in Russia had access to the Internet (almost 30% of the population). [10]  In 2012, 75.9 million Russians (53% of the population) had access. [11]  In December 2015, most part of country, 92.8 million Russians (70% of the population) have Internet access. [12] \n Following his visit to Russia in 2004,  \u00c1lvaro Gil-Robles , then  Commissioner for Human Rights  of  Council of Europe , noted the high quality of news and reaction speed of Russia's Internet media. Virtually all the main newspapers were available on-line, some even opting for Web as a sole information outlet. Russia's press agencies (including the most important  Ria-Novosti  and  Itar-Tass ) were also well represented in the Web. [9] \n In April 2008  Agence France-Presse  noted that, \"The Internet is the freest area of the media in Russia, where almost all television and many newspapers are under formal or unofficial government control\". [13] \n As reported by Kirill Pankratov in April 2009 in  The Moscow Times : \n Even discounting the chaotic nature of the web, there is plenty of Russian-language material on political and social issues that is well-written and represents a wide range of views. This does not mean, though, that most Russians are well-informed of the important political and social issues of today. But this is largely a matter of personal choice, not government restrictions. If somebody is too lazy to make just a few clicks to read and become aware of various issues and points of view, maybe he deserves to be fed bland, one-sided government propaganda. [14] \n In a November 2009  address to the Federal Assembly , then President of Russia  Dmitry Medvedev  acknowledged that Russia was ranked only as the world's 63rd country based on estimates of the level of communications infrastructure development. He stressed the necessity to provide broadband Internet access to the whole Russian territory in five years, and to manage the transition to digital TV, as well as the  4G  of cellular wireless standards. [15] \n In 2010  OpenNet Initiative  noted, that while \"the absence of overt state-mandated Internet filtering in Russia has led some observers to conclude that the Russian Internet represents an open and uncontested space\", the government had a consistent, strategic approach to taking control over the information in electronic media.  2007 cyberattacks on Estonia  and  cyberattacks during the Russo-Georgian War  (2008) may have been \"an indication of the government\u2019s active interest in mobilizing and shaping activities in Russian cyberspace\". \n Developments since 2012 [ edit ] \n Establishment and expansion of the blacklist [ edit ] \n First countywide judicial censorship measures were taken by the government in the wake of the  2011\u201313 Russian protests . This included the Internet blacklist law, implemented in November 2012. The criteria for inclusion in the blacklist initially included  child pornography ,  advocating suicide  and  illegal drugs . In 2013, the blacklist law was amended with content \"suspected in extremism\", \"calling for illegal meetings\", \"inciting hatred\" and \"violating the established order\". [16]  The law allowed for flexible interpretation and inclusion of a wide array of content. Popular opposition websites encouraging protests against the court rulings in  Bolotnaya Square case  were for example blocked for \"calling for illegal action\";  Dumb Ways to Die , a public transport safety video, was blocked as \"suicide propaganda\"; websites discussing federalization of Siberia \u2014 as \"attack on the foundations of the constitution\"; an article on a gay activist being fired from job as well as LGBT support communities \u2014 as \"propaganda of non-traditional sex relations\"; publishing  Pussy Riot  logo \u2014 as \"insult of the feelings of believers\"; criticism of overspending of local governor \u2014 \"insult of the authorities\"; publishing a poem in support of Ukraine \u2014 \"inciting hatred\" etc. [2] [3]  A separate class of materials blocked due to \"extremism\" are several religious publications, mostly  Muslim  and  Jehovah's Witnesses . Bans can be challenged in courts, and in some cases these appeals are successful. [17] [18] \n Increase in Internet censorship [ edit ] \n According to data published by the Russian Society for Internet Users founded by members of the  Presidential Council for Human Rights , instances of censorship increased by a factor of 1,5 from 2013 to 2014. The incidents documented include not only instances of Internet blocking but also the use of force to shut down Internet users, such as beatings of bloggers or police raids. [19] \n Human rights NGO  Agora  reported that instances of internet censorship increased ninefold from 2014 to 2015, rising from 1,019 to 9,022. [20] \n A ban on all software and websites related to circumventing internet filtering in Russia, including  VPN software , anonymizers, and instructions on how to circumvent government website blocking, was passed in 2017. [21] \n Proposals for further controls [ edit ] \n In 2015,  Russia's Security Council  proposed a number of further Internet controls to prevent hostile \"influence on the population of the country, especially young people, intended to weaken cultural and spiritual values\". Prevention of this \"influence\" also includes active countermeasures such as actions targeted at the population and young people of the states attempting to weaken Russia's cultural values. [22]  Another initiative proposes giving Roskomnadzor right to block any domain within the  .ru   TLD  without a court order. [23] \n In February 2016, the business daily  Vedomosti  reported on a draft law by the  Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications  titled \"On an Autonomous Internet System\". The bill calls for placing the domains  .ru  and  .\u0440\u0444  under government control and would make installation of the Russian state surveillance system  SORM  mandatory. [3] \n Monitoring [ edit ] \n Main article:  Mass surveillance in Russia \n SORM system [ edit ] \n Main article:  SORM \n Russia's  System of Operational-Investigatory Measures (SORM)  requires telecommunications operators to install hardware provided by the  Federal Security Service  (FSB). It allow the agency to unilaterally monitor users'  communications metadata  and content, including phone calls, email traffic and web browsing activity. [8]  Metadata can be obtained without a warrant. [8]  In 2014, the system was expanded to include social media platforms, and the  Ministry of Communications  ordered companies to install new equipment with  Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)  capability. [24] \n Data retention [ edit ] \n See also:  Yarovaya law \n The \"Bloggers law\" (passed July 2014) is an amendment to existing  anti-terrorism  legislation which includes  data localization  and  data retention  provisions. Among other changes, it requires all web services to store the user data of Russian citizens on servers within the country. Sites which did not comply with this requirement by September 2016 may be added to the internet blacklist. [25] [26]  Since August 2014, the law requires operators of free  Wi-Fi  hotspots (e.g. in restaurants, libraries, cafes etc.) to collect personal details of all users, identify them using passports, and store the data. [27] \n The \" Yarovaya law \" (passed July 2016) is a package of several legislative amendments which include extensions to data retention. Among other changes, it requires telecom operators to store recordings of phone conversations, text messages and users' internet traffic for up to 6 months, as well as metadata for up to 3 years. This data as well as \"all other information necessary\" is available to authorities on request and without a court order. [28] \n As of January 2018, companies registered in Russia as \"organizers of information dissemination\", such as online messaging applications, will not be permitted to allow unidentified users. [29] \n Mass media [ edit ] \n On Mass Media \n Federal Law No. 2121-1, \"On Mass Media\" \n Citation \n 2121-1 \n Date passed \n 27 December 1991 \n The federal telecommunications regulator  Roskomnadzor  can issue warnings to the editorial board of mass media and websites registered as mass media concerning \"abuse of mass media freedom.\" [3]  According to the \"Law on Mass Media\", such abuse can include \"extremist\" content, information on  recreational drug use , the propagation of cruelty and violence, as well as  obscene language . [3]   [30] \n If a media outlet receives two warnings within a year,  Roskomnadzor  can request a court order shutting down the media outlet entirely. [3] \n Internet blacklist [ edit ] \n On Amending Federal Law \"On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development and Other Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation\" \n Citation \n 139-FZ \n Date passed \n 11 July 2012 \n Date commenced \n 1 November 2012 \n Summary \n Implements a central Internet blacklist (\"single register\") \n Legislation [ edit ] \n In July 2012, Russia's  State Duma  passed a law requiring the establishment of an Internet  blacklist . The law took effect on 1 November 2012. [31]  The blacklist Is administered by the  Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media  (Roskomnadzor) and the  Federal Drug Control Service of Russia . [32] \n On Amending Federal Law \"On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection\" \n Citation \n 398-FZ \n Date passed \n 20 December 2013 \n Summary \n Allows additional categories of content to be blocked without a court order \n At the time of introduction the list was described as a means for the protection of children from harmful content; particularly content which glorifies drug usage, advocates suicide or describes suicide methods, or contains child pornography. [33]  In 2013 legislative amendments allowed the blocking of content \"suspected in extremism\", \"calling for illegal meetings\", \"inciting hatred\" and any other actions \"violating the established order\". [16]  This content can be blocked without a court order by the office of the Prosecutor General. [34] \n On Amending Federal Law \"On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection\" \n Citation \n 276-FZ \n Date passed \n 21 July 2017 \n Date enacted \n 29 July 2017 \n Date commenced \n 1 November 2017 \n Bill citation \n 195446-7 \n Summary \n Bans all software and websites related to circumventing internet filtering in Russia \n In July 2017, Vladimir Putin signed a bill, which took effect 1 November 2017, which bans all software and websites related to circumventing internet filtering in Russia, including  anonymizers  and  VPN  services which do not implement the blacklist, and instructional material on how to do so. [21] [35] \n Implementation [ edit ] \n The implementation of the blacklist is outlined in a  government  decree issued in October 2012. [36] \n Roskomnadzor  offers a website where users can check to see whether a given URL or IP address is in the blacklist, and can also report websites which contain prohibited materials authorities. After a submission is verified, Roskomnadzor will inform the website's owner and hosting provider. [37]  If the material is not removed within three days, the website will be added to the blacklist, and all Russian  ISPs  must block it. [38]  The full content of the blacklist initially was not available to the general public, [37]  although soon after it was implemented, a leaked list of blacklisted websites was published by a  LiveJournal  user on 12 November 2012. [39] \n The searchable blacklist interface was made available as a full list by activists. As of July 2017 it includes over 70,000 entries. [40] \n Reaction [ edit ] \n Russian Wikipedia  during its 2012 protest against the blacklist \n Reporters Without Borders  criticized the procedure by which entries are added to the blacklist as \"extremely opaque\", and viewed it as part of an attack on the freedom of information in Russia. [41]  In 2012, when the banned content only included child pornography, drugs and suicide, the human rights activists have expressed fear that the blacklist may be used to censor democracy-oriented websites [33]  (which indeed happened the next year). [16]  And a  Lenta.ru  editorial noted that the criteria for prohibited content are so broad that even the website of the ruling  United Russia  party could in theory be blacklisted. [42]  However, the idea was at that time generally supported by the Russian public: in a September 2012  Levada Center  survey, 63% of respondents had expressed support for \" Internet censorship \", [43] [44]  though any kind of censorship is banned under the Constitution of Russia. \n The  Electronic Frontier Foundation  has criticized the blacklist, stating: \"EFF is profoundly opposed to government censorship of the Internet, which violates its citizens right to freedom of expression... We are especially concerned about the censorship of independent news and opposing political views, which are essential to a thriving civil society. Russians who wish to circumvent government censorship can continue to read these websites via the  Tor Browser .\" [45] \n Instances of censorship [ edit ] \n A number of websites maintain lists of websites currently blocked in Russia, based on different sources of information. [46] [47] \n Notable instances of censorship: \n Prior to 2012 \nBlacklist entries as of June 2017 by agencies responsible for the entry \nIn 2004 Russia pressured  Lithuania , and in 2006  Sweden , into shutting down the  Kavkaz Center  website, a site that supports creation of a  Sharia state  in  North Caucasus  and hosts videos of terrorist attacks on Russian forces in the North Caucasus. [48] [49] [50] \n During the December 2008 demonstrations in  Vladivostok , [51]  it was reported by the Kontury news website that FSB officers issued a request that moderators of the  ru_auto  Internet community remove stories about the protests. The major reason, as reported by a moderator of the resource, was that repeating posts containing information about the protests worsened people's attitudes. The moderator in question requested bloggers to publish only unique posts about protest actions. [52] \n In December 2009, Internet provider  Yota , with over 100,000 subscribers [53]  blocked access to some Russian opposition Internet resources for its Moscow-based subscribers for a few days. This occurred after the chief prosecutor of St. Petersburg recommended that the company prevent access to extremist resources. The only Internet resource listed as extremist by the Ministry of Justice of Russia at the time was that of the Caucasian separatists,  KavkazCenter.ru . Since the evening of 6 December 2009,  Yota  allowed access to all previously blocked resources except  KavkazCenter.ru . [54] [55] \n 2012 \n On 8 April 2012, it was confirmed by Roskomnadzor that several  Russian  and  English Wikipedia  articles had been blacklisted. [56] \n In July 2012, the Russian  State Duma  passed the  Bill 89417-6 , which provided a blacklist of Internet sites. [57] [58]  The blacklist was officially launched in November 2012, despite criticism by major websites and NGOs. [33] \n The IP address of  Lurkmore.to  (Lurkomorye) was blocked on 11 November 2012 after a decision of the  Federal Drug Control Service of Russia ; the owner of the site told journalists he did not receive any communication from Roskomnadzor or the Federal Drug Control Service before the IP address was blacklisted. [59] [60]  Lurkmore.to was removed from the blacklist on 13 November 2012 after the website administrators deleted two marijuana-related articles. [61] \n The IP address of the  Librusec  online library was blacklisted on 11 November 2012. [62]  According to a leaked copy of the blacklist, it was blocked for a description of marijuana soup in a Russian translation of  The Anarchist Cookbook . [39]  The IP address was unblocked on 13 November after  The Anarchist Cookbook  was removed by Librusec administrators. [63] [64] \n 2013 \n On 31 March 2013 the  New York Times  reported that Russia was \"Selectively Blocking [the] Internet\". [65] \n On 5 April 2013, a spokesperson for Roskomnadzor confirmed that the Russian Wikipedia had been blacklisted because of the article, \" Cannabis smoking \". [66] [67] \n 2014 \n In March 2014, in the midst of the  Crimean crisis , the LiveJournal blog of  Alexei Navalny ,  Kasparov.ru  and  Grani.ru  were blocked by the government. These sites, which opposed the Russian government, were blocked for \"making calls for unlawful activity and participation in mass events held with breaches of public order.\" [68] \n December 2, 2014 \u2014 Supreme Court of the Russian Federation bans  jw.org \n In August 2014 a number of websites were blocked as the  war in Donbass  developed, including the Ukrainian news site,  Glavnoe.ua , [69]  a survey about the separation of the  Caucasus  from Russia [70]  and numerous announcements and commentaries about the \"march for Siberia federalisation\". [71] \n In 2014, a media blackout was launched against a  performance art  project called  Monstration  scheduled for 17 August. Roskomnadzor issued warnings to fourteen media outlets for reporting the announcement. [72]  The project was compared to  Euromaidan , which led to the  2014 Ukrainian revolution . \n In October 2014 Roskomnadzor blocked the  Internet Archive 's  Wayback Machine  site, well known for its  Archive.org  website. [73]  A number of websites listing blocked addresses was also blocked, including such as  Zapretno.info . \n In October and December 2014, a popular source code repository,  GitHub , was temporarily blocked for hosting a page containing (mostly) satirical suicide instructions, frequently used to troll the Russian censorship system. [74] \n In December 2014 a  Facebook  page protesting an event against the prosecution of  Alexey Navalny  was blocked in the Russian Federation. A Roskomnadzor representative stated that the page was blocked because it promoted an \"unsanctioned mass event\". [75] \n 2015 \n In January 2015 a number of  Bitcoin  related websites were blocked (including  bitcoin.org ) because \"it contributes to shadow economy\". [76]  In February,  Bitstamp  was unblocked. [77] \n In February 2015, Russia blacklisted \"Children-404\", a website providing Russia's  LGBT  teens with an outlet to anonymously share their personal experiences with one another, for allegedly violating the country's law against promoting homosexuality. [78] \n An on-line article by  Yulia Latynina  in  Novaya Gazeta  was blocked for unspecified \"extremism\", most likely a suggestion that \"Russian culture only became great when it mixed with European\". [79] \n After a Russian consumer protection watchdog OZPP published a warning for Russian tourists about possibility of being denied EU visas after visiting Crimea, [80]  explaining that from the international law point of view  Crimea is an occupied territory ,  Roskomnadzor  blocked the OZPP website \"for threatenting territorial integrity of Russian federation\". [81] \n In June 2015, some ISPs blocked the  Internet Archive  entirely following an order to censor a page contained within for containing \"extremist\" material. These blocks were a side effect of the site's use of  HTTPS  possibly being incompatible with how ISPs implement their filters. [82] \n On 21 July 2015 the official website of  Jehovah's Witnesses  was banned throughout the  Russian Federation . Jehovah's Witnesses say that the motion to ban them was originally filed on 7 August 2013 [83]  but was overturned after they voluntarily removed certain publications from the version of the site presented to Russian IP addresses. [84]  However, on December 2, 2014 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation overturned the Regional Court, stating that the Witnesses might choose to reinstate the materials they had volunteered to remove. [85] \n On the 12th of August 2015 the whole of  Reddit  was blocked in Russia by Roskomnadzor because of a post made by a Reddit user on the site. The post is a guide for growing  Psilocybe  mushrooms. The block was lifted on the next day after Reddit complied with Roskomnadzor's demand of blocking access from users in Russia to the specific post. [86] [87] \n As of August 2015 [update] , 4 Wikipedia articles remain blocked in Russia, and more than 25 were blocked for some time. Most of these articles are related to drugs and suicide. [88] \nRutracker.org blocked in Russia, 2016 \n On 25 January 2016 Rutracker.org, the biggest torrent tracker in Russia and CIS countries, with about 13 million users, was permanently blocked by Roskomnadzor as a result of a decision of the Moscow City Court. [89] \n 2016 \n On 28 January 2016, pages related to the  annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation  were blocked on  Archive.is  when accessed through non-encrypted traffic.  HTTPS  traffic to the website was blocked entirely. [90] \n On 4 August 2016, a Moscow court ruled that  LinkedIn  must be blocked in Russia because it stores the user data of Russian citizens outside of the country, in violation of the new data retention law. This ban was upheld on 10 November 2016. [91]  and the ban was officially issued by Roskomnadzor on 17 November 2016. [92] \n 2017 \n In 2017 an image of Putin as a \"gay clown\" was added as item 4071, [93]  as a result of a 2016 legal case against social media activist A. V. Tsvetkov.
