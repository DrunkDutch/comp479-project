Is this a 64-bit processor? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n This is, in fact, a 64-bit processor.  \n Thanks! \n 3 \n 1 \n Is there an easy way to install a 64-bit processor? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Yes, open up the PC. Look for a big fan. Unscrew the fan. Underneath the fan is a processor. Take out the processor. Put in a 64 bit processor (must purchase separately). Apply thermal paste. Put the fan back on. Close the computer. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 0 \n I have a 32-bit processor, how can I get a 64-bit processor? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n You buy one by going on Amazon and finding a chip that is compatible with your motherboard. Or delete Windows 32 by going into the Windows file on My PC and delete it. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 1 \n What is a 64 bit PC? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 2 \n So can you still play the game if you have Windows XP or not?
