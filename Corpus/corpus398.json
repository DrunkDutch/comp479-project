It was created to provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but at a lower price than a personal computer with a  CD-ROM  drive at the time. The cost savings were due to the lack of a  floppy drive ,  keyboard ,  mouse , and  monitor  (a standard television is used), and less  operating system  software. CD-i also refers to the multimedia Compact Disc standard used by the CD-i console, also known as  Green Book , which was developed by  Philips  and  Sony . \n In addition to games, educational and multimedia reference titles were produced, such as interactive encyclopedias and museum tours, which were popular before public  Internet  access was widespread. The CD-i was also one of the earliest  game systems to implement Internet features , including subscriptions, web browsing, downloading, e-mail, and online play. This was facilitated by the use of an additional hardware modem that Philips released in 1996 for $150. [4]  Competitors included the  Tandy VIS  and  Commodore CDTV . \n Work on the CD-i began in 1984 and it was first publicly announced in 1986. [5]  The first Philips CD-i player, released in 1991 and initially priced around US$700, [6]  was capable of playing interactive CD-i discs,  Audio CDs ,  CD+G  (CD+Graphics), Karaoke CDs,  Photo CDs  and  Video CDs  (VCDs), though the latter required an optional \"Digital Video Card\" to provide  MPEG-1  decoding. The CD-i was a  commercial failure , selling one million units across all manufacturers in seven years, and losing Philips $1 billion.

[7]  Early software releases focused heavily on educational, music, and self-improvement titles, with only a few games, many of them adaptations of  board games  such as  Connect Four . However, the system was handily beaten in the market for multimedia devices by cheap low-end  PCs , [8]  and the games were the best-selling software. By 1993 Philips encouraged MS-DOS and console developers to create games, introduced a $250 peripheral with more memory and support for full-motion video, and added a second controller port for multiplayer games to new consoles. [7] \n The attempts to develop a foothold in the games market were unsuccessful, as the system was designed strictly as a multimedia player and thus was under-powered compared to other gaming platforms on the market in most respects. [9]  Earlier CD-i games included entries in popular  Nintendo  franchises, although those games were not developed by Nintendo. Specifically, a  Mario  game (titled  Hotel Mario ), and three  Legend of Zelda  games were released:  Zelda's Adventure ,  Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon . Nintendo and Philips had established an agreement to co-develop a CD-ROM enhancement for the  Super Nintendo Entertainment System  due to licensing disagreements with Nintendo's previous partner Sony (an agreement that produced a prototype console called the  SNES-CD ). While Philips and Nintendo never released such a CD-ROM add-on, Philips was still contractually allowed to continue using Nintendo characters. \n Applications were developed using  authoring software  produced by OptImage. This included OptImage's Balboa Runtime Libraries and MediaMogul. The second company that produced authoring software was Script Systems; they produced ABCD-I. \n Philips also released several versions of popular TV  game shows  for the CD-i, including versions of  Jeopardy!  (hosted by  Alex Trebek ),  Name That Tune  (hosted by  Bob Goen ), and two versions of  The Joker's Wild  (one for adults hosted by  Wink Martindale  and one for kids hosted by  Marc Summers ). All CD-i games in North America (with the exception of  Name That Tune ) had  Charlie O'Donnell  as announcer. The Netherlands also released its version of  Lingo  on the CD-i in 1994. \n In 1993, American musician  Todd Rundgren  created the first music-only fully interactive CD,  No World Order , for the CD-i. This application allows the user to completely arrange the whole album in their own personal way with over 15,000 points of customization. \n CD-i has a series of learning games (\" edutainment \") targeted at children from infancy to adolescence. Those intended for a younger audience included  Busytown ,  The Berenstain Bears  and various others which usually had vivid cartoon-like settings accompanied by music and logic puzzles. \n Although extensively marketed by Philips, notably via  infomercial , [10]  consumer interest in CD-i titles remained low. By 1994, sales of CD-i systems had begun to slow, and in 1998 the product line was dropped. Philips had by then, already sold its gaming subsidiary, Philips Media BV to French publisher  Infogrames  in 1996. \n A large number of  full motion video  titles such as  Dragon's Lair  and  Mad Dog McCree  appeared on the system. One of these,  Burn:Cycle , is considered one of the stronger CD-i titles and was later ported to PC. The February 1994 issue of  Electronic Gaming Monthly  remarked that the CD-i's full motion video capabilities were its strongest point, and that nearly all of its best software required the MPEG upgrade card. [11] \n In 1996 Philips introduced CD-Online, a system which provided the CD-i with full internet access, including online shopping and support for networked multiplayer gaming on select CD-i games. Andy Stout, a writer for the official CD-i magazine, explained CD-Online: \n It is very much Internet-lite. The main advantages are that it's cheap - probably working out at a third of the cost of a PC or Mac solution - and incredibly user-friendly. The downside though is using a browser that doesn't support  Netscape , and coping with all the drawbacks of the machine's minuscule memory - you can only ever access 10 articles on  Usenet  at a time, it'll only support 80  bookmarks  maximum and for all that trouble all your saved games, preferences, and high scores will been written over in RAM. ... It's got the full access right now but with only about 40% of the functionality, which will probably be fine for people who don't know what they're missing. But the  virtual keyboard  is a complete nightmare to use ... [12] \n With the home market exhausted, Philips tried with some success to position the technology as a solution for kiosk applications and industrial multimedia.

Philips marketed several CD-i player models. \n The  CD-i player 200 series , which includes the 205, 210, and 220 models. Models in the 200 series are designed for general consumption, and were available at major home electronics outlets around the world. The Philips CD-i 910 is the American version of the CD-i 205, the most basic model in the series. \n The  CD-i player 300 series , which includes the 310, 350, 360, and 370 models. The 300 series consists of portable players designed for the professional market and not available to home consumers. [ clarification needed  (not available?) ]  A popular use was multimedia sales presentations such as those used by pharmaceutical companies to provide product information to physicians, as the devices could be easily transported by sales representatives. \n The  CD-i player 400 series , which includes the 450, 470, 490 models. The 400 models are slimmed-down units aimed at console and educational markets. The CD-i 450 player, for instance, is a budget model designed to compete with game consoles. In this version, an infrared remote controller is not standard but optional. \n The  CD-i player 600 series , which includes the 601, 602, 604, 605, 615, 660, and 670 models. The 600 series is designed for professional applications and software development. Units in this line generally include support for  floppy disk  drives,  keyboards  and other computer peripherals. Some models can also be connected to an emulator and have software testing and debugging features. \n There also exist a number of hard-to-categorize models, such as the FW380i, an integrated mini-stereo and CD-i player; the 21TCDi30, a television with a built-in CD-i device; and the CD-i 180/181/182 modular system, the first CD-i system produced. \n Other manufacturers [ edit ] \n In addition to Philips, several manufacturers produced CD-i players, including  Magnavox , [11]   GoldStar  /  LG Electronics , Digital Video Systems,  Memorex ,  Grundig ,  Saab Electric ,  Sony  (Intelligent Discman, a portable CD-i player),  Kyocera ,  NBS , Highscreen, and  Bang & Olufsen , who produced a television with a built-in CD-i device (Beocenter AV5). \n TeleCD-i and CD-MATICS [ edit ] \n Recognizing the growing need among marketers for networked multimedia, Philips partnered in 1992 with Amsterdam-based CDMATICS to develop TeleCD-i (also TeleCD). In this concept, the CD-i player is connected to a network such as  PSTN  or Internet, enabling data-communication and rich media presentation. Dutch grocery chain  Albert Heijn  and mail-order company  Neckermann  were early adopters and introduced award-winning TeleCD-i applications for their home-shopping and home-delivery services. CDMATICS also developed the special Philips TeleCD-i Assistant and a set of software tools to help the worldwide multimedia industry to develop and implement TeleCD-i. TeleCD-i is the world's first networked multimedia application at the time of its introduction. In 1996, Philips acquired source code rights from CDMATICS. \n Technical specifications [ edit ] \nA presentation controller for the Philips CD-i.

Dedicated video game consoles based on CD-ROM media include  Sega Mega Drive/Genesis  with  Sega Mega-CD/Sega CD  expansion,  3DO Interactive Multiplayer , and  NEC TurboDuo . \n Reception [ edit ] \n Although Philips had aggressively promoted CD-i, by August 1993  Computer Gaming World  reported that \"skepticism persists about its long-term prospects\" compared to other platforms like  IBM PC compatibles ,  Apple Macintosh , and  Sega Genesis . [16]  The magazine stated in January 1994 that despite Philips' new emphasis on games \"CD-i is still not the answer for hardcore gamers\", but the console \"is 'not quite dead, yet' and may yet surprise us all in the future\". It recommended the CD-i with video cartridge for those needing to buy a new console as \"The price is right and there is more software to support it\", but 3DO was probably better for those who could wait a few months. [7]  An early 1995 review of the system in  GamePro  stated that \"inconsistent game quality puts the CD-i at a disadvantage against other high-powered game producers.\" [17]  A late 1995 review in  Next Generation  criticized both Philips's approach to marketing the CD-i and the hardware itself (\"The unit excels at practically nothing except  FMV , and then only with the addition of a $200 digital video cartridge\"). The magazine noted that while Philips had not yet officially discontinued the CD-i, it was dead for all intents and purposes, citing as evidence the fact that though Philips had a large booth at the 1995  Electronic Entertainment Expo , there was no CD-i hardware or software on display.  Next Generation  scored the console one out of five stars. [10] \n After its discontinuation, retrospectively, the CD-i was overwhelmingly panned by critics about its graphics, games, and controls.  Microsoft  CEO  Bill Gates  admitted that initially he \"was worried\" about the CD-i due to Philips's heavy support for the device and its two-pronged attack on both the games console and PC markets, but that in retrospect \"It was a device that kind of basically got caught in the middle. It was a terrible game machine, and it was a terrible PC.\" [18]  The CD-i's various controllers were ranked the fifth worst video game controller by  IGN  editor Craig Harris. [19]   PC World  ranked it as fourth on their list of \"The 10 Worst Video Game Systems of All Time\". [20]  Gamepro.com listed it as number four on their list of  The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time. [21]  In 2008,  CNET  listed the system on its list of  The worst game console(s) ever.   [22]  In 2007,  GameTrailers  ranked the Philips CD-i as the fourth worst console of all time in its Top 10 Worst Console lineup. [23] \n Games that were most heavily criticized include  Hotel Mario ,  Link: The Faces of Evil ,  Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon , and  Zelda's Adventure . EGM's  Seanbaby  rated  The Wand of Gamelon  as one of the  worst video games of all time . [24]  However,  Burn:Cycle  was positively received by critics, and has often been held up as the standout title for the CD-i.
