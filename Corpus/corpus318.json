However,\u00a0 many may not be using this option yet so you should still check their app settings as I mentioned earlier and see if they are offering a dark theme option. \n Be sure to check out all of our  Windows 10 Anniversary Update Coverage . \n But, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on  Twitter  and  Google+ . \n 0 comments   \n Hide comments \n Comment  * \n More information about text formats \n Text format  \n Comments Plain text \n Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.
