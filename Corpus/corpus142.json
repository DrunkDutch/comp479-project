Besides your studies,  keeping on top of money  will be one of your biggest challenges. \n In short: you\u2019re going to have to  learn how to live on a budget ! Sound boring? It doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 but it is an essential part of succeeding at university. Why? Most of the cash you will spend is going to be borrowed money. Eventually, that borrowed money will have to be paid back. \n Budgeting will help you be better prepared to pursue your goals.\u00a0 \n Making a budget is not as hard as you may think it is. \u00a0 \n A budget is basically an  itemized summary  of likely  income  and  expenses  for a given period of time. Budgets help you determine whether you can buy that afternoon Venti Latte or head home and make your own instead. \u00a0 \n A budget provides you with a tangible, organized, and easily understood analysis of how much money you have coming in and going out. It\u2019s an invaluable tool to help you prioritize your spending and manage your money\u2014no matter how much or how little you have. \n \u00a0 \n Get started: plan your budget \n Let's start this process by organizing your money management into a few helpful steps. \n Learn the basic steps to making a budget \n Budgeting Buying on credit Banking and financial institutions Visit us for advice Basic steps to making a budget \n Connect with us \n Financial Aid & Awards Office \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
