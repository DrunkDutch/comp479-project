Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down.\n    Narrator:\n Joe Biden \n    Promise Me, Dad\n    By:\n                                Joe Biden\n                                374\n                                ratings\n    Narrator:\n                                Joe Biden\n    Duration:\n                            8 hrs and 53 mins\n    Format:\n                            Unabridged\n                            In November 2014, 13 members of the Biden family gathered on Nantucket for Thanksgiving, a tradition they had been celebrating for the past 40 years; it was the one constant in what had become a hectic, scrutinized, and overscheduled life. The Thanksgiving holiday was a much-needed respite, a time to connect, a time to reflect on what the year had brought, and what the future might hold.

Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.\n    Narrator:\n Edoardo Ballerini \n    Beautiful Ruins\n    By:\n                                Jess Walter\n                                10290\n                                ratings\n    Narrator:\n                                Edoardo Ballerini\n    Duration:\n                            12 hrs and 53 mins\n    Format:\n                            Unabridged\n                            The story begins in 1962.
