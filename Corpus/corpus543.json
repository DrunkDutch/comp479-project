The firm, a subsidiary of  Johnson & Johnson , is headquartered in  Leiden ,  Netherlands . Crucell shares were previously listed on the  Euronext  Amsterdam  exchange  and formed part of the  AMX index  until April 2011, when J&J completed a  tender offer  for the company. \n Contents \n 1   Technologies \n 2   History \n 3   Vaccine products \n 3.1   Paediatric \n 3.2   Travel and endemic \n 3.3   Respiratory \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n Technologies [ edit ] \n Crucell develops and licenses technologies related to the discovery and manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines, and gene therapy products. [3] \n History [ edit ] \n In 1993  Introgene , Crucell\u2019s predecessor, was established as a  spin-off  of  Leiden University . The company formed a partnership with  Genzyme  to collaborate on its vector technology and viral-based products. In 1999 the company founded  Galapagos Genomics  as a joint venture together with  Tibotec . In 2000 IntroGene acquired  U-Bisys  to form Crucell. \n In 2006, Crucell and Swiss Berna Biotech, Swedish SBL Vaccines and US-based Berna Products joined forces to become the sixth largest vaccine company worldwide, with their own clinical programs. \n On 7 January 2009 Crucell released a  press release  saying Crucell and  Wyeth  were in discussion on a merger of the two companies. On 26 January 2009 Crucell released another press release saying the discussions on a combination of Crucell and Wyeth was discontinued due to  Pfizer 's acquisition of Wyeth. \n On 28 September 2009  Johnson & Johnson  bought 18% stake in Crucell for \u20ac302 million in order to collaborate on the development of a  flu vaccine . [4]  This follows in the wake of Crucell's discovery of  CR6261 , a potent human antibody that neutralizes a broad range of influenza A viruses. J&J agreed to acquire the rest of the company in October 2010, taking its stake to over 95% by February 2011 [5]  and delisting the company from stock exchanges two months later. [6] \n Crucell has received U.S.  National Institutes of Health  (NIH) funding to develop Ad26.ZEBOV, a potential vaccine that would protect against both the  Ebola virus disease   hemorrhagic fever  (from the  Ebola virus ; the causative agent of the  2014 Ebola outbreak  in western Africa- the largest ever of the disease, with at least 1,000 deaths), and  Marburg hemorrhagic fever  (from the  Marburg virus ), which produces similar symptoms because both are hemorrhagic fever diseases. The prognosis for both, especially without early accurate diagnosis and modern treatments and care standards, is usually quite poor. The Ad26.ZEBOV potential vaccine followed by a second vaccine (MVA-BN from  Bavarian Nordic ) as  boost  completed Phase 1 trials in 2015 [7]  and Phase 2 trials were planned for 2016.
