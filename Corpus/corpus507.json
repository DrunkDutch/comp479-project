However, given that in one scene the Rodger Young is shown to be on a collision course with one of these asteroids, and that they are able to take evasive action after Carmen and Zander sight the asteroid visually would seem to suggest that the simpler explanation is that Director Paul Verhoeven just ignored the physics of the situation for cinematic effect or simply because that is what the plot required.   \n  10 of 10 found this interesting \n Interesting? \n Yes \n No \n |   Share this \n    Share this:  Facebook \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Twitter \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Permalink \n Hide\u00a0options \nThis was the final American film Paul Verhoeven supervised; he never really fully recovered from Showgirls (1995) and moved back to Europe after this movie.   \n  10 of 10 found this interesting \n Interesting? \n Yes \n No \n |   Share this \n    Share this:  Facebook \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Twitter \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Permalink \n Hide\u00a0options \nWhen Carmen Ibanez is taking the starship out of dock the first time, she flicks a switch to release the hoses attached to the docking platform.

Originally, it was clear that Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander.

These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should have been the one to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting it may have been a bad commercial decision not to change the film to accommodate this, the directors did cut a scene from after Zander's death where Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.   \n  11 of 11 found this interesting \n Interesting? \n Yes \n No \n |   Share this \n    Share this:  Facebook \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Twitter \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Permalink \n Hide\u00a0options \nIn the film, during live training, Djana'D (Tami Adrian George) shoots and kills Breckinridge accidentally, resulting in Rico's flogging.

Many of its symbols, such as the eagles on the Federal Armed Services uniforms, are actually based off of those used in 20th century American culture and military institutions. In any case, Paul Verhoeven admited using the Nazi Orpo flag as an inspiration for the Ferderation flag design.   \n  5 of 5 found this interesting \n Interesting? \n Yes \n No \n |   Share this \n    Share this:  Facebook \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Twitter \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Permalink \n Hide\u00a0options \nThe sport Johnny plays, which is a combination of football and gymnastics, is called \"jumpball.\" His team is \"the Tigers\" and Zanders' is \"the Giants.\"   \n  18 of 25 found this interesting \n Interesting? \n Yes \n No \n |   Share this \n    Share this:  Facebook \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Twitter \n    \u00a0 | \u00a0\n     Permalink \n Hide\u00a0options \nThe tune Ace plays while Johnny Rico is dancing with Diz is the Mexican song \"Las Golondrinas\" (The Swallows).
