Our mandate is to provide an overview of strong work from each semester, thus our selection for each issue continuously varies in concept, medium and style. Through a well-considered sequence and minimal layout  we are able to successfully integrate these diverse artworks into our printed exhibition space.  \nInterfold is produced with the assistance of: \n FASA Concordia \n CCSL \n CUAA \n BookArt \n Papeterie St. Armand \nInterfold can be found at: \n Fine Arts Reading Room (FARR) \n FASA Office \r\nVA lobby \n Argo Bookstore \n Artexte \n MFA MIXER \n Issue 12 \n Launch \n Issue 11 \n Launch \n Past Issues \n Issue: 10  \n Issue: 9 \n Issue 8 \n Issue 7"}
