Her Pegship  15:20, 21 December 2005 (UTC) \n Barmy! [ edit ] \n I think that, with the exceptions of the trio, Dumbledore, Hagrid, McGonagall and Snape, all of the cast should be listed alphabetically...

HTH HAND \u2014 Phil  |  Talk  10:18, 7 February 2006 (UTC) \n near the end of the 4th.\n They appeared in a photograph on Harry's bedside table in 3, and in the Priori Incantatem in 4.  Squidward2602  16:34, 27 March 2006 (UTC) \n Isaacs confirmed? [ edit ] \n Jason Isaacs is confirmed to play Lucius Malfoy? I thought he was likely though not confimed to return.... ForestH2   ( discuss  |  contribs ) \n Mess [ edit ] \n This page is a complete mess. First of all, Saunders Triplets did not play Harry Potter in all 5 films. It's needs a lot of cleanup and I plan to do some after I switch some minor things.  Treebark  22:09, 1 July 2006 (UTC) \n While I know you weren't aware of it, I think that you need to take a look at the page  prior to  the major clean-up I performed on it on 7 June, and also  before  it had categories. Also, I suppose it was rather ambiguous with the Saunders Triplets occupying a cell that spanned five columns, but I don't feel \"Baby Harry Potter\" merits its own row as we have the attribute '(y)' for younger, so I compromised and went with the way I did Hagrid as younger. I anticipate the changes you're going to make eagerly, but I just thought you should know the drastic changes it's gone through in three weeks' time. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 02:53, 2 July 2006 (UTC)\n As far I am concerned it looked really bad having, Baby Harry Potter as Saunders Triplets have 5 columns. Have you fixed all the young verisons?  ForestH2  |  +  |  \u221a+  |  \u221a  |  \u221a-  |  -  02:57, 2 July 2006 (UTC)\n you should probably note \"Saunders Triplets (Harry as a baby)\" because until I read this, I had no idea what that was a reference to.  \u2014Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  208.100.207.122  ( talk ) 23:49, 19 September 2007 (UTC) \n Remus is/was Hogwarts teacher [ edit ] \n I'd categorize Remus as staff of Hogwarts not as a member of the OoP. His role in PoA was significantly greater than his better cameo in OoP. Also Firenze was part of Hogwarts staff for a time, which should qualify him for entry in that category. Whether Moody should be moved to the staff section also is open for discussion as he didn't actually teach himself. -- Mirage GSM  10:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC) \n Requested move [ edit ] \n The following discussion is an archived discussion of the proposal.  Please do not modify it.  Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. \n List of Harry Potter films cast members  \u2192  List of Harry Potter films' cast members  \u2014 Gramatical error, alternatively  List of cast members in the Harry Potter films .

Please remember that this survey is  not a vote , and please provide an explanation for your recommendation. \n Survey - in support of the move [ edit ] \n Survey - in opposition to the move [ edit ] \n Oppose  The article name is fine as is. \"Harry Potter films\" is an adjectival phrase and so doesn't need to be made possessive. If we were only talking about a single film, for example, I don't think anyone would object to \" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  cast members\" and want to change it to \" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  's cast members\". \"Harry Potter films cast members\" is the same as the first construction, but plural. -- Shelf Skewed   talk  21:36, 13 April 2007 (UTC) \n Oppose  I agree that there is no grammatical error here, and thus in opposition to  this  move. I have comments below about other moves. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 03:51, 14 April 2007 (UTC) \n Discussion [ edit ] \n Add any additional comments: \n See the convention in  Category:Actors by drama television series . I think  List of Harry Potter cast members  would be best and no one would confuse it for the novels. \u2013 Pomte  00:49, 4 April 2007 (UTC) \n That sounds clear to me, until there's a Broadway musical. I support removing \"films\".  Dekimasu \u3088!  13:51, 9 April 2007 (UTC)\n When I renamed this page from  Harry Potter cast  I just wanted to be absolutely clear. I thought that throwing in the \"films\" wasn't that annoying, and it certainly straightened up any sort of weird doubts one might have. But if there's consensus for just the  List of Harry Potter cast members , that's okay with me. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 03:51, 14 April 2007 (UTC) \n The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the proposal.  Please do not modify it.  Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on this talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. \n While the title \"List of Harry Potter cast members\" may be acceptable to most participants in this debate, there is no compelling reason to move to that title, since there is no problem with the existing title.   It was  requested  that this article be renamed but there was no consensus for it be moved.  -- Stemonitis  06:33, 15 April 2007 (UTC) \n Pomfrey [ edit ] \n I saw Pomfrey in the 1st and 3rd movie two she is in the background also I saw Kate Bell,Angelina Johnson Oliver Wood and Alica Spinnet in the 3rd movie at the Imfirmary and the match. and I think Lee Jordan was in the background of the 4th. I don't know where to put this but I saw the back half of Fang in the 3rd movie when Harrys telling Hagrid it will be alright and Trever the Frog in Longbottom's hands when the Fat lady is singing \n key [ edit ] \n The key indicates various things, but not what dark grey is.  70.55.86.129  07:34, 4 July 2007 (UTC) \n Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott sources [ edit ] \n Um, all of the Hogwarts school students or at least more of them are listed as \"Will not be casted\" with a reference to  this  which says nothing about cutting any characters except for Luicus Malfoy in the Ministry of Magic. If someone could point me to the real source we are trying to get or something I missed in the article, please let me know.  Hornberry  14:35, 9 July 2007 (UTC) \n Hmm, it's not the most reliable of sources anyway, regardless of the fact that you're right, it doesn't mention any students; I'll remove it. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 23:00, 9 July 2007 (UTC) \n Sorry, I see now where the error was. The note \"will not be cast\" does not apply to all the cells in the section; just to the one whose row it's in. So, Bletchley will not be cast because the source confirms Quidditch is cut. Same with Pucey and Hooch. In any case, though, I'll change the source to a more reliable one which also confirms there's no Quidditch. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 23:02, 9 July 2007 (UTC) \n Elanor Columbus was seen in a cameo role in the 4th film, can someone edit and add her in GoF 219.74.73.237  17:50, 5 August 2007 (UTC)ray \n Sorry, it needs a source. Can you find a  verifiable   citation  to prove so? -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 21:33, 5 August 2007 (UTC) \n i can't find any internet source for the Eleanor Columbus cameo but I watched the film again today and she is indeed in it. After Harry has returned from the graveyard confrontation and Mr. Diggory is grieving over Cedric's body they show various shots of the crowd. One of them is a shot of Neville and next to him is indeed Eleanor Columbus. ( 84.196.130.213  ( talk ) 20:15, 31 October 2008 (UTC)) \n Deathly Hallows [ edit ] \n With the release of the seventh book, it is now possible to fill in the seventh column with dark/light grey cells, corresponding to which characters appear \"on-screen\" in the book. I'd be happy to make a start on this. Would this be appropriate?  Tesseran  05:18, 22 July 2007 (UTC) \n Personally I feel we shouldn't add a seventh column until all casting is confirmed for the sixth film. Then you could start to get confused with double darks for some characters, or a light and then a dark or a dark and then a light. Best to hold off, I'd say. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 21:34, 5 August 2007 (UTC) \n Nigel [ edit ] \n Why does Nigel have a dark grey cell? 68.6.83.188  01:16, 17 August 2007 (UTC) \n It's a light grey cell. He does not appear in the book. \n Do mentions of seeing people count as appearances? [ edit ] \n I would say no. If Harry sees somebody in passing, and that person has no other role (e.g. Cho in HBP), does that person \"appear\" in the book? Realistically, I think we can determine that the filmmakers aren't going to rehire Katie Leung just so that Harry can see her on the train, but in the Wikipedia way of thinking, what do other people think is the appropriate thing to do? -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 02:58, 12 September 2007 (UTC) \n Well I think it is a book appearance... But I dont know if Cho will be in the film version (as we know they love to cut stuff out). We'll probably not see her on the train, but you never know. And the thing about \"seeing people count as appearances\" isnt that the whole deal? I mean, she is seen on the train and therefore appear in the book, she is mentioned in \"real time\", not like \"Oh I saw Cho 5 weeks ago\" right?  Chandler talk  14:59, 17 September 2007 (UTC)\n I don't have the book handy, but I believe it's something like Harry saw Cho in the distance on the train or something. The reason I bring it up is because the HP Lexicon doesn't count it as an appearance in their  Readers' Guide . -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 16:53, 17 September 2007 (UTC)\n I have the book handy (though not english version), and it is something like: Everybody is trying to get a look at harry, except cho who runs into her compartment. Than harry goes past it and look in at cho to see that she is in a conversation with her friend.  Chandler talk  17:17, 17 September 2007 (UTC)\n \"The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming.\" So it is entirely feasbile that she could be in the film, (although not very likely) just as Harry walks to to the Slug Club. But Harry does see her, the next sentence says Harry looked into her compartment. So she \"does\" appear in the book. But yeah, things like the many mentions of Stan Shunpike do not count as an appearance.  Gran 2  17:19, 17 September 2007 (UTC)\n Very well then. We'll count it as an appearance. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 00:57, 18 September 2007 (UTC) \n To clarify, all the people who I added as being seen at Dumbledore's funeral are not simply mentions like, \"Harry said, 'Oh, I saw Umbridge a couple hours ago.'\" It's the narration of the book saying that Umbridge, and all the other people who I added, are present in the scene but without dialogue. They are seen by the narrator, not the characters. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 14:38, 27 September 2007 (UTC)can someone make jessie caves profile shes been in loads of projects im surprised nobodys made one before \n Katie Leung will resume her role as Cho Chang for a brief role. I'd say she would have a line but I think she should be put down regardless.  \u2014Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  213.202.174.150  ( talk ) 20:21, 2 June 2008 (UTC) \n Older versions of List [ edit ] \n For those interested as to what this list would have looked like had it been around at the release of films two through five, I have designed four subpages to document this. They can be found at  After 2 ,  After 3 ,  After 4  and  After 5 . At the release of the sixth film I will create another subpage. Please do not edit these pages with factual information; edits should only be made for spelling or formatting. Just something which had been interesting me for a while. It's pretty cool to go back and forth quickly between two pages (using apple+[ and apple+] for me) to show how things progressed between films. -- Fbv 65 e del  /  \u2611t  /  \u261bc  || 19:09, 23 September 2007 (UTC) \n Added some info on the first film as people would like to see what actors were cast at the time of the realease of film one, also wih the release of the sixth film I also updated that article as well.  pday2387  ( talk ) 11:05, 8 September 2009 (UTC) \n Person in 3rd movie [ edit ] \n There was a person in the 3rd movie.... he was the one that read to harry about \"the grim\"... i dont think he was in the book but he wasnt anyone from the other movies.... does any one know??  \u2014Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  Agarden  ( talk  \u2022  contribs ) 10:45, 22 January 2008 (UTC) \n I've read in a few places that his name is \"Bem\" and played by Ekow Quartey, but there's no source to confirm this, sorry. Ekow Quartey is in the IMDb credits for the film those he's credited as playing \"Boy #1\" I think. -- Fbv 65 e del  \u2014  t  \u2014  c  // 03:15, 27 January 2008 (UTC) \n Characters who could appear in two or more headers [ edit ] \n Based on a comment in the edit history, I've just been thinking about somebody like Quirrell who could appear under both the \"Hogwarts staff\" and \"Death Eaters\" headers -- what should we do with him? I mean, it would be nice to be complete under either of them, so should we list him twice? That might seem a little unprofessional though. I am still leaning towards Death Eaters but somebody who's only a film watcher would probably associate him more with Hogwarts staff. Any other thoughts? -- Fbv 65 e del  \u2014  t  \u2014  c  // 03:22, 27 January 2008 (UTC) \n No. Including them once is fine, just put them in the area that they are most associated with. As for Quirrell... I suppose he was a teacher for more of the film.  Gran 2  07:32, 27 January 2008 (UTC \n Slightly Creepy Boy = Michael Corner [ edit ] \n Though I don't have an \"official link\" or any source, Slightly creepy boy is in fact Michael Corner, the Ravenclaw guy that dated Ginny Weasley. He appears next to her in the Hog's Head part of the movie. Thought I should at least say it =/ \n Well, you think it's Michael Corner, and I think it's Michael Corner, but WB doesn't, and that's what makes him Slightly Creepy Boy. If we had a source, I'd change it in a heartbeat. But he's not called that (honestly, for all we know, he could just be John Smith who happens to have Corneresque traits), so we can't change it. Sorry! -- Fbv 65 e del  \u2014  t  \u2014  c  // 22:25, 2 February 2008 (UTC) \n If you've a source/citation, we'll be sure to put it up.  BlackPearl14 Pirate Lord-ess  23:19, 2 February 2008 (UTC) \n Colin Creevey [ edit ] \n You put a light grey header under colin creevey in \"Deathy Hallows\" but since colin hasn't appered in any movies after \"Chamber of secrets\" and the only time we see him in that book is when he's dead, it's very unlikely the actor will come back. they probably won't have a real person play colin's body, and it will probably be nigel that will die.  \u2014Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  67.150.175.194  ( talk ) 16:30, 27 February 2008 (UTC) \n You never know, everyone doubted Katie Leung would come back to be cast in a scene were she darts into her compartment when she see's Harry but yet they've been proved wrong. So you never know, there's still a possibility. -- Jammy  ( talk ) 17:58, 27 February 2008 (UTC) \n Bellatrix in goblet of fire [ edit ] \n Is it possible that bellatrix was cast for goblet of fire, but her scene was cut, and not released on the dvd?  \u2014Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  66.53.211.199  ( talk ) 16:38, 29 February 2008 (UTC) \n She was in Azkaban in the Goblet of Fire, so why would they add her in the movie? She first appears in Order of the Phoenix, and I wish you would stop asking questions about deleted scenes. -- Jammy  ( talk ) 20:30, 29 February 2008 (UTC) \n Editors shouldn't be answering questions like this one, just deleting them - they're off topic; the purpose of talkpages is to discuss improvements to the relevant articles.

Anchoress   \u00b7   Weigh Anchor   \u00b7   Catacomb  23:16, 4 March 2008 (UTC) \n Susie Shinner [ edit ] \n Susie Shinner redirects here, listed as the actress playing Lily Potter as a young woman in the  Potter family  article, but she isn't listed here.  Anchoress   \u00b7   Weigh Anchor   \u00b7   Catacomb  23:14, 4 March 2008 (UTC) \n I'll update the  Potter family  article. She was originally cast, according to a UK newspaper (forgot which one at the moment) and a studio still was released of her with Harry in the background; however she did not appear in the film nor its credits, and was not in any deleted scenes either. Thus technically he is not in the movie in any form, and there is no source other than photographic evidence, which does not give a definitive statement, to say what happened to her, unlike with, say, Rik Mayall (Peeves), where there exists a source to say he filmed scenes but none were ever distributed. I strongly suspect, in my own personal opinion, that Shinner shot scenes but they just were cut when they trimmed down that scene she was in. However, we'll have to wait for a source to confirm this before we write anything. -- Fbv 65 e del  \u2014  t  \u2014  c  // 02:17, 5 March 2008 (UTC) \n Jessie Cave as Lavender Brown!

Besides the fact that is character is virtually the same as Zacharias Smith in the books, the exact same character (same likeness and same voice actor) is called Zacharias Smith in the official video game.

I stayed for the credits afterwards and I'm pretty sure she was there, near the end, and the credits were in appearance order, so it's possible she appeared in the scene following Dumbledore's death where everybody lifts their wands to the skies. Can't be sure though.

Lizzie   Harrison  08:14, 7 April 2010 (UTC) \n Suggestion [ edit ] \n Could the list please be organised better. The sections are fine, but the placing of the characters in each sections lacks logic are all over the place. If you have a look at  Spider-Man_(film_series)#Cast_and_characters , the characters are staggered from order of first appearance, so it's like a medal table of sorts. First table is gold, second is silver, third is bronze, etc. It looks better, is logical, and would improve this article. A few film series used to be nice looking like this, but as more films came out, randoms added new characters and the whole thing just gets messy. Anyone else think it would be a good idea to rearrange the characters into something like this?

Harry Taylor is to reprise his role. This should be added. ( http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2010/5/24/first-photos-of-adult-harry-and-ginny-from-deathly-hallows-epilogue ) \n Also, Madam Rosmerta has a dark grey cell; indicating she appears in the DH book. Her name is not mentioned. The \"Battle of Hogwarts\" chapter mentions that \"several shopkeepers and owners of stores\" appear, yet the only one mentioned by name is Aberforth Dumbledore. I suggest her dark grey gell be changed to a light grey cell and still keep the \"will not appear\" text. Thanks!  Alex Douglas  ( talk ) 13:10, 26 May 2010 (UTC) \n Also, in  Goblet of Fire , the Weird Sisters appeared. Regardless, it must still be mentioned.

I think it is a good idea, but you must keep in mind that this will have to be actualized when the full credit comes out with the movies.

Have a good day!-- Stroppolo talk  23:19, 19 March 2010 (UTC)\n Due to the fact that not all actors in Hallows part 1 will necessarily be seen in Hallows part 2 and vice versa, I have added an additional column for Hallows part 2. (And btw, the encyclopedia isn't going to incrementally improve if good-faith edits are to be reverted with missing or misleading rationales given.) \nAlso note that all additions of actors names to the chart should be accompanied by a published source.-- 71.187.173.34  ( talk ) 05:59, 26 June 2010 (UTC) \n W/regard to a contributor's recent, pointless reversion of the extensive coding work already discussed within this talkpage section, I would like to give hi/r an opportunity to explain hi/rself before I turn to  wp:ani . In violation of WP's ideals of welcoming constructive contributions and cooperating well with collaborators, s/he neither responded to the guideline cited nor the commentary here on the talkpage. I would request that this individual please consider rebutting the application of appropriate policy and also to achieve consensus before further reversion of this meticulous and painstaking coding work.-- 68.197.105.51  ( talk ) 22:01, 27 June 2010 (UTC) \n I am not in opposition to the inclusion of two columns for  Deathly Hallows  given the nature of the two-part film adaptation. At this point, however, there has been no announcement regarding which actors/actresses will appear in which adaptations, and yet all are listed (as of the current revision) in both columns with the curious exception of Mrs. Cole (portrayed by Amelda Brown). Furthermore, there are uncited claims of a few actors returning to their roles; without sources, these assumptions cannot be made, and for some reason, the actors who do not have a Wikipedia page are linked anyway, creating the dead red link. Is this necessary? I await a response. And for the record, I have explained the nature of my edits in all my edit summaries, thus omitting the uncanny idea of negligence or a lack of civility.  Never Mystic  ( t c ) 00:34, 28 June 2010 (UTC) \n IMO the issue turns on what is/is not to be thought of as precipitous editing. Contributors had noticed the need and stepped in to provide this coding, which it appears agreed by all will eventually be necessary. Is adding this coding  precipitous?  The reason I don't believe it is, is because such coding simply ain't  click, click, and we're done --it takes a good hour- plus  of clicks along with figuring out the whys and wheres of making them; thus, leaving the coding in allows whomever to be added and even assigned to one column or the other with no need to invest hours of research/time to figure out how to do so (this is why basic editing guidelines are written the way they are, especially at  WP:PRESERVE ); and, yet, note that at present, to all extents and purposes, only one column is  used. \n As for precipitous additions of Amelda Brown et al, the discussion of whether to use single-column or double-column has absolutely zero relation to such questions. Per basic editing guidelines, the proper response to such unsupported contributions is either fact tag, if the information seems likely to be true, or else simply to remove them.  And, in point of fact,  Amelda Brown  had already been removed  prior  to Never Mystic's ( precipitous? ) deletion of the complex and eventually-needed coding for the double column . \n Peace out. (Btw, note that there is one place on the chart which doesn't perhaps have sourcing and, indeed, I've just \"fact tagged\" it.\u00a0:~) -- 71.187.173.34  ( talk ) 01:48, 28 June 2010 (UTC) \n --And fact-tagged \"Amelda Brown.\"-- 71.187.173.34  ( talk ) 01:54, 28 June 2010 (UTC)\n Never Mystic, I finally  get  your point that a column break implies a level of precision that at present we're lacking, hence I've put \"2010/2011\" together into a single column for the time being--nonetheless retaining the coding for an eventual 9th column, per the above commentary. Thanks and sorry.-- 71.187.173.34  ( talk ) 02:13, 28 June 2010 (UTC)\n It's fine. That's what these discussions are for and I see we've made good progress. In fact, the chart looks more organized, and, yes, is appropriate considering the lack of information released to the public pertaining to who is in which adaptation. The only concern of mine that remains is listing George Harris or Peter Perry among others because \"the information seems likely to be true\"\u2014we still don't know if it's \"likely\", and shouldn't have the information included in the article if it's not fact, which is a basic guideline of Wikipedia. I propose to remove all speculative information unless it can be substantially justified (and with a source, not \"likeliness\").  Never Mystic  ( t c ) 02:29, 28 June 2010 (UTC) \n Per above, I've removed the red links and all  unsourced claims .  Never Mystic  ( t c ) 19:49, 29 June 2010 (UTC) \n Time to restore DH split? [ edit ] \n Since  Deathly Hallows, Part 1  has been released, we should be able to find a reliable source listing its cast and split the last column accordingly. (Is  Yahoo! Movies  a reliable source, or is it user-edited like IMDb? What about  IMDb , once the film has opened? How about  Fandango ?) I can't seem to get the film's official site to load at the moment, but perhaps there's a cast list there. At any rate, I think that it should be possible to get a cast list from a reliable source, and re-split the column. \u2014 Josiah Rowe   ( talk  \u2022  contribs )  05:01, 28 November 2010 (UTC) \n Layout [ edit ] \n I am not sure why the layout had to be redone per film appearances (first through seventh/eighth), but doing so has made the list disorderly in that it was originally alphabetical. The way that  User:IAmTheCoinMan  edited it to me seems like a random preference of the material. Comments and/or concerns?  Never Mystic  ( t c ) 05:29, 10 July 2010 (UTC) \n I did it as all the the character section pages used to be like on multiple film series pages, it looks a lot better and is generally done by order of appearance/number of. See how  Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series)#Principal_cast  is done, the main characters are up the top as a result of this listing. same with  Spider-Man_(film_series)#Cast_and_characters . Don't you think it looks better and uses a more relevant way of listing characters, ie by the role of the characters rather then the order of letters in a alphabet. I know other stuff exists, and the same would go for the reverse of what I'm saying, but why should the character listing in a section be done on something as irrelevant as the orders of letters in an alphabet?

Also, Robert Hardy, Natalia Tena, Miriam Margoyles, Gemma Jones, David Bradley, and George Harris have all been in more than one film should we add them even though they are not that famous? I'm definitely adding John Cleese, as he is very famous and he appeared in the first two films.  Evil Genius77  ( talk ) 23:53, 16 August 2010 (UTC) \n I am of a new point on the matter after speaking with  Fae . I believe we should add Christie as well as Branagh, as both are Oscar and BAFTA nominees, but otherwise we should leave the list the same. I do not know if we should add Nighy, as he is a renowned actor, though has no such credentials as Christie and Branagh do.  Evil Genius77  ( talk ) 22:30, 18 August 2010 (UTC) \n Flitwick vs Macnair [ edit ] \n The reasoning behind not putting Warwick Davis's name in the Flitwick row in Prisoner of Azkaban was because he was credited as 'Wizard'. Why then is Peter Best in the Walden Macnair section in Prisoner if he was cast as 'Executioner'?  \u00a0 The Windler   talk \u00a0  05:19, 18 August 2010 (UTC) \n I think both have been retconned seeing as the Executioner is Walden Macnair in the novels, and since Flitwick and the Choir Conductor have been retconned to be the same person (see the Half-Blood Prince line \"Emergency Choir Practice\" on the way to Hogsmeade) I agree with you.

All sources (Casting Call Pro, IMDB) can be edited by himself. Interviews with him are unsourced. Also so far as I am aware studios don't regularly let uncredited extra's give interviews with large fansites.. \n Furthermore he has been caught out vandalizing the wikipedia page of his school in order to include him as the \"Eighth Earl of Norbury\" (which he demonstrably is noe) and also an actor from the Harry Potter films. It is obvious that this guy is editing wikipedia/other places in order to enhance his image as a largely unheard of actor, but Wikipedia should not play a part in his vanity. Thus I have removed him from the article until a source is found which is not manufactured by him. \n It would not be acceptable if I made a page saying I had a position then created a vanity page, thus editing yourself into other things for vanity's sake should not be allowed. \n Discussion here which highlights many of the problems with Castrianni's \"involvement\" and proof he has been involved in past wikipedia vandalism.  http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category_talk:Candidates_for_deletion#.22Lord.22_John_Paul_Castrianni   JamieHughes  ( talk ) 18:27, 10 May 2011 (UTC) \n In the \"ghosts\" section it says that one of the ghosts is Rowena Ravenclaw.

Topher385  ( talk ) 18:28, 10 August 2011 (UTC) \n New way to list cast [ edit ] \n I don't know if this contradicts any WP policies, this is just a more objective alternative to the current way of listing. I've devised a point system for the Harry Potter cast based on how they are billed in the CREDITS of the Harry Potter films. There are six levels: \n 6 points - Daniel Radcliffe, first billing. \n 5 points - Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, secondary (and alphabetical) billing. \n 4 points - cast members presented by themselves after the three principals in alphabetical order (for example, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, and Maggie Smith are listed in this section.) \n 3 points - cast members presented with one other cast member at a time after level three alphabetical order (for example, Tom Felton, Warwick Davis, and Mark Williams are listed in this section.) \n 2 points - cast members listed alphabetically after level four (this occurs only in Philosopher's Stone, when David Bradley and Tom Felton are listed after level 4, in Chamber of Secrets, when six adult cast members are listed after level 4, and in Goblet of Fire, when Stanislav Ianevski, Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, and Robert Pattinson are listed after level four.) \n 1 point - cast members credited only in the \"official\" credits used by IMDB, listed in order of appearance after the end of the \"fancy\" credits, if you will (for example, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch, and Devon Murray are credited solely in this section.) \n I have gone through the official credits for all of the films and created a master-list of all of the actors credited in each film, assigning them points based on their billing. I have changed the names of the characters from their credited names (which also occasionally change from film to film) to those used as the titles of articles on the Harry Potter Wiki. This was done purely as part of my Harry Potter geekiness, and changing the names back would be simple. So, without further ado, here is the cast list for all those cast members who earned at least two points throughout the series (I can provide those who earned only one point as well, but we'd have a serious problem with notability): \n Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter \u2013 48 \n Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley \u2013 40 \n Emma Watson as Hermione Granger \u2013 40 \n Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid \u2013 32 \n Alan Rickman as Severus Snape \u2013 32 \n Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall \u2013 28 \n Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore \u2013 24 \n Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick/Griphook

The title of the first movie was \"Harry Potter and the Scorcerer's Stone.  \u2014 Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  66.190.233.132  ( talk ) 05:18, 5 December 2011 (UTC) \n The first film (and book) is called  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  in the UK, and  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  in the U.S. As this is a British property, the UK titles are used. -- Rob Sinden  ( talk ) 12:00, 5 December 2011 (UTC) \n Fix up [ edit ] \n Now that the film series is over, I decided to clean up this article by removing the references since we already have the credits to reference. Since this article had many fan site refs, I made the article look even more like an FL. Cheers!  Guy546 ( Talk )  20:54, 1 January 2012 (UTC) \n Update: I just re-added a ref for Sean Biggerstaff because he isn't credited. If there are any other cast members like that, please tell me. Thanks.

Add (Lily Evans) in brackets underneath Lily Potter. Otherwise the name doesn't link from the search page and it's hard to find it here. The page for  Darcey-Alden  should be linked. Thanks.  99.11.160.111  ( talk ) 10:59, 29 December 2012 (UTC) \n Daniel Radcliffe as Voldemort [ edit ] \n I'm not sure if this point has been raised or settled, but Daniel Radcliffe did portray Voldemort very briefly during that part of \"Order of the Phoenix\" when Voldemort invaded Harry Potter's mind. If that \"counts\" as an appearance, then the list should be updated.-- S trinitrotoluene  ( talk ) 23:47, 28 April 2014 (UTC) \n Semi-protected edit request on 24 September 2015 [ edit ] \n This  edit request  has been answered.
