The river rises in the county of  Wiltshire  and flows through the city of  Salisbury  and the county of  Hampshire  before reaching the  English Channel  through  Christchurch Harbour  in the county of  Dorset . \n It is sometimes known as the  Salisbury Avon  or the  Hampshire Avon  in order to distinguish it from the various other River Avons in England. It is one of the rivers in  Britain  in which the phenomenon of  anchor ice  has been observed. [1]  The Avon is thought to contain more species of fish than any other river in Britain.

The western Avon  rises  to the east of  Devizes , draining the  Vale of Pewsey , and the eastern Avon rises just east of  Pewsey  adjacent to the  Kennet and Avon Canal . These two merge at  Upavon , flowing southwards across  Salisbury Plain  through  Durrington ,  Amesbury  and  Salisbury . To the south of Salisbury it enters the  Hampshire Basin , flowing along the western edge of the  New Forest  through  Fordingbridge  and  Ringwood , meeting up with the  River Stour  at  Christchurch , to flow into  Christchurch Harbour  and the  English Channel  at  Mudeford . \n All the significant direct and indirect tributaries of the Avon, including the  Nadder ,  Wylye ,  Bourne  and  Ebble , converge within a short distance around Salisbury. \n About half of the length of the river is within Wiltshire, and only relatively short proportions are entirely within the current boundaries of Hampshire or Dorset. However, for part of its path the river forms the border between Dorset and Hampshire, and prior to the  1974 reorganization of local government  the whole of the section now in or bordering Dorset was wholly within Hampshire. As there are two rivers with the name Avon in Wiltshire, this led to the river being popularly known as the Hampshire Avon or the Salisbury Avon. \n The  Avon Valley Path  runs parallel with the river from Salisbury to Christchurch. \nA view of the River Avon in Hampshire near Fordingbridge. \nAn angling scene at the Hampshire Avon at the Royalty fishery, Christchurch, Dorset in March 2017. \n Rights of use [ edit ] \n Court cases were brought in the 18th century concerning the loss of navigation of the river. [3]  One was in 1737 and another was in 1772. [4] \n Canoeists  seeking legitimate access to the Avon have recently identified a long-forgotten Act in their favour. The \"Act for making the River Avon navigable from Christchurch to the city of New Sarum\" was enacted in 1664 under  Charles II . [5]  This act has not been repealed, hence remains in force and might provide a legal right of navigation. \n However, the 1664 Act was subject to enabling works which were never completed, hence the suggestion of an implementable Act has fallen away. Whilst an Act was passed, the responsibility for delivery was given in 1685 to private undertakers in the names of Hodges, Bennett and Dennett, who were to fund the canalisation from Salisbury to Christchurch. They were allowed to charge their investment at 10% interest rate and could take full commercial advantage. Tripartite agreements from 1684 and 1685 evidence these agreements. The House of Commons journal of the 31st January 1699 records that the freeholders, inhabitants and residents of Ibsley and Fordingbridge petitioned the House on the fact that they could not comply with the 1664 Act and were never likely to do so. These petitions were upheld by the House, thus the obligations and rights of the 1664 Act fall away as the works to canalise the Avon were never implemented. \n Settlements [ edit ] \n Wiltshire \nUpper Avon Valley: \n Upavon \n East and West Chisenbury \n Enford \n Coombe \n Fittleton \n Haxton \n Netheravon \n Figheldean \n Milston \n Durrington \n Bulford \n Amesbury \n Woodford Valley: \n West Amesbury \n Wilsford cum Lake \n Great Durnford \n The Woodfords \n Little Durnford \n Salisbury: \n Stratford-sub-Castle \n Salisbury \n Wiltshire Watermeadows: \n Britford \n Bodenham \n Charlton All Saints \n Downton \n Hampshire: \n Breamore \n Burgate \n Fordingbridge \n Bickton \n Ibsley \n Ringwood \n Sopley \n Dorset: \n St Ives \n Burton \n Christchurch \n Conservation [ edit ] \n A four-year project called  STREAM  began in September 2005. This was a \u00a31 million project designed to benefit the habitats of species such as  Water-crowfoot ,  Atlantic salmon ,  Brook lamprey ,  Sea lamprey ,  bullhead ,  Desmoulin's whorl snail ,  Gadwall  and  Cygnus columbianus  Berwick's swan. [6] \n There is also a sister project called  Living River  which runs from 2006 to 2010. This is providing better access and recreation, as well as biodiversity. [7] \n Both of these projects had been shortlisted for the 2009  Thiess International Riverprize  competing against four other projects: the  Yellow River  in  China ,  Lake Simcoe  in  Canada , the  Polochic Basin  in  Guatemala  and the  Lower Owens  River in the USA. The prize for 2009 was awarded to Lake Simcoe. [8] \n In 1993 the Avon Valley between  Bickton  and  Christchurch  was designated as a  Site of Special Scientific Interest  (SSSI).
