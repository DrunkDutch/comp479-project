[1] [8] [9]  She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent. [10] [11]  Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Roman Catholic, [12]  and she was raised Catholic. [13] [14]  Her older brother,  Eric Roberts , from whom she was estranged until 2004, sister  Lisa Roberts Gillan , and niece  Emma Roberts , are also actors. \n Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in  Atlanta , off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in  Decatur, Georgia , while they were expecting Julia. The children of  Martin Luther King, Jr.  and  Coretta Scott King  attended the school; Walter Roberts was their daughter  Yolanda Denise King 's acting coach. [15]  As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born. [16] \n Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972. [17]  From 1972, Roberts lived in  Smyrna, Georgia , where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and  Campbell High School . [18]  In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him. [19]  The couple had a daughter, Nancy Motes, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose. [20]  The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life. [19]  Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten. [21] \n Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child. [22]  She also played the  clarinet  in her school band. [23] [24]  After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended  Georgia State University  but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes. [25] [26] \n Acting career [ edit ] \n 1980s [ edit ] \n Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film  Satisfaction  (1988), alongside  Liam Neeson  and  Justine Bateman , as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother, Eric, in  Blood Red  (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was only released in 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series  Crime Story  with  Dennis Farina , in the episode titled \"The Survivor\", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film  Mystic Pizza  in 1988; [27]  that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of  Miami Vice . In 1989, she was featured in  Steel Magnolias , as a young bride with  diabetes , and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as  Best Supporting Actress ) and first Golden Globe Award win ( Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress ) for her performance. [27] \n 1990s [ edit ] \n Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with  Richard Gere  in the  Cinderella / Pygmalionesque  story,  Pretty Woman , in 1990. [27]  Roberts won the role after  Michelle Pfeiffer ,  Molly Ringwald ,  Meg Ryan ,  Jennifer Jason Leigh ,  Karen Allen , and  Daryl Hannah  (her co-star in  Steel Magnolias ) turned it down. [28]  The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as  Best Actress , and second Golden Globe Award win, as  Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy) . [27]  Her next box office success was the thriller  Sleeping with the Enemy , playing a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by  Patrick Bergin , and begins a new life in Iowa. She played  Tinkerbell  in  Steven Spielberg 's  Hook  in 1991, and also played a nurse in the 1991 film,  Dying Young . This work was followed by a two-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in  Robert Altman 's  The Player  (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a  People  magazine cover story asking, \"What Happened to Julia Roberts?\" [29]  She was offered the role of Annie Reed in  Sleepless in Seattle  (1993), but turned it down. [30] \nRoberts at the  Deauville American Film Festival  in Normandy, France, September 1990 \n Roberts co-starred with  Denzel Washington  in  The Pelican Brief  (1993), based on  John Grisham 's  1992 novel of the same name . [27]  In 1996, she appeared in  season 2  of  Friends  (episode 13 \" The One After the Superbowl \"). [31]  She had a relationship with cast member  Matthew Perry  at the time. [32] [33] [34] [35]  According to an audience member, Roberts said to Perry about their on-screen kiss, \"I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend.\" [36]  She was offered the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz in  While You Were Sleeping  (1995), but turned it down. [30] \n Roberts co-starred with  Liam Neeson  in  Michael Collins  (1996). [27]  Over the next few years, she starred in  Stephen Frears '  Mary Reilly  (1996), followed by  My Best Friend's Wedding  in 1997. In 1998, she appeared on  Sesame Street  opposite the character  Elmo , demonstrating her ability to change emotions. She was offered the role of  Viola de Lesseps  in  Shakespeare in Love  (1998) but turned it down. [30]  She starred in the films  Stepmom  (1998), alongside  Susan Sarandon , [37]   Notting Hill  (1999), with  Hugh Grant , and, also in 1999, in  Runaway Bride , her second film with Richard Gere. Roberts was a guest star on the  Law & Order  television series episode \" Empire \" with series regular  Benjamin Bratt  (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for  Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series . [38] \n 2000s [ edit ] \n In 2000, she played the lead role of real-life environmental activist  Erin Brockovich  in the film  Erin Brockovich . \n In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make  The Hollywood Reporter ' s  list of the 50 most influential women in show business  since the list had begun in 1992. [3] \n In 2001, Roberts received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in  Erin Brockovich . Roberts' acceptance speech for the award went over the allowed time limit but did not mention the real-life Brockovich, for which Roberts later apologized, saying she forgot. [39]  While presenting the Best Actor Award to  Denzel Washington  the following year, Roberts made a gaffe, saying she was glad that  Tom Conti  wasn't there; she meant the conductor,  Bill Conti , who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor. [40] \n Brad Pitt ,  George Clooney ,  Matt Damon ,  Andy Garc\u00eda , and Roberts with  Ocean's Eleven  director  Steven Soderbergh  in December 2001 \n Roberts' first film following  Erin Brockovich  was the road gangster comedy,  The Mexican , giving her a chance to work with long-time friend  Brad Pitt . The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an  independent production  without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together.  The Mexican  earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office. [41]  Later in 2001, she starred in the romantic comedy  America's Sweethearts  along with  Billy Crystal ,  John Cusack , and  Catherine Zeta-Jones . Directed by  Joe Roth , the Hollywood  farce  centers on a  supercouple , Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked \"sympathetic characters\" and was \"only funny in spurts.\" [42]  A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however. [43] \n In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with  Erin Brockovich  director  Steven Soderbergh  for  Ocean's Eleven , a  comedy-crime caper  film and remake of the 1960  Rat Pack  film  of the same name , featuring an  ensemble cast  including  George Clooney ,  Brad Pitt , and  Matt Damon . Roberts played  Tess Ocean , the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by  Angie Dickinson , who is dating a casino owner played by  Andy Garc\u00eda . In preparation for her role, Roberts studied Dickinson's performance by watching the original film at least seven times in order to get her part right. [44]  A success with critics and at the box office alike,  Ocean's Eleven  became the  fifth highest-grossing film of the year  with a total of US$450 million worldwide. [45] \n In 2003, Roberts was cast in  Mike Newell 's drama film  Mona Lisa Smile , also starring  Kirsten Dunst ,  Maggie Gyllenhaal , and  Julia Stiles . Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at  Wellesley College  in 1953 \u2013 the highest ever earned by an actress until then. [46]  The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it \"predictable and safe\". [47] \n In 2004, Roberts replaced  Cate Blanchett  in  Mike Nichols 's  Closer , a  romantic drama  film written by  Patrick Marber , based on his award-winning  1997 play of the same name . [48]  The film also starred  Jude Law ,  Natalie Portman , and  Clive Owen . [48]  Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel  Ocean's Twelve . The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to their strong resemblance. [49]  Though less well reviewed than  Eleven , the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run. [50]  Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series' third and final installment,  Ocean's Thirteen  (2007), due to script issues. [51]  In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single \" Dreamgirl \" by the  Dave Matthews Band ; it was her first music video appearance. [52] \n Roberts appeared in  The Hollywood Reporter ' s list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005. [5] \nRoberts in Paris promoting  Eat Pray Love , September 2010 \n Roberts had two films released in 2006:  The Ant Bully  and  Charlotte's Web . Both films were animated features for which she provided  voice acting . [53] [54]  Her next film was  Charlie Wilson's War  (2007), with  Tom Hanks  and  Philip Seymour Hoffman , directed by  Mike Nichols ; it was released on December 21, 2007. [ citation needed ]   Fireflies in the Garden  (2008), also starring  Ryan Reynolds  and  Willem Dafoe , was released at the  Berlin International Film Festival  in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas; it did not get a North American release until 2011. [ citation needed ] \n Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of  Richard Greenberg 's 1997 play  Three Days of Rain  opposite  Bradley Cooper  and  Paul Rudd . Although the play grossed nearly US$1\u00a0million in ticket sales during its first week [55]  and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of  The New York Times  described Roberts as being fraught with \"self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.\" [56]  Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that \"it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.\" [56]  Writing in the  New York Post ,  Clive Barnes  declared, \"Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain\u2014even if three days of it can seem an eternity.\" [57] \n In 2009,  Lanc\u00f4me  announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company. [58] \n 2010s [ edit ] \nRoberts at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival \n Roberts starred with  Clive Owen  in the comedy-thriller  Duplicity  for which she received her seventh  Golden Globe  nomination. In 2010, she appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy  Valentine's Day , with Cooper, and starred in the film adaptation of  Eat Pray Love .  Eat Pray Love [59]  had the highest debut at the box office for Roberts in a top-billed role since  America's Sweethearts . [60]  Later in the year, she signed a five-year extension with Lanc\u00f4me for  GB\u00a332  million. [61]  In 2011, she co-starred as Mercedes Tainot in the romantic comedy  Larry Crowne  opposite  Tom Hanks , who directed and played the title role. [62]  The movie received generally bad reviews with only 35% of the 175  Rotten Tomatoes  reviews giving it high ratings, [63]  although Roberts's comedic performance was praised. [64]  Roberts appeared in the 2012  Tarsem Singh  adaptation of  Snow White , titled  Mirror Mirror , playing  Queen Clementianna , Snow White's evil stepmother. [65] \n In 2013, Roberts appeared in  August: Osage County , playing one of  Meryl Streep 's character's three daughters. [66]  Her performance earned her nominations for the  Golden Globe Award ,  Screen Actors Guild Award ,  Critics' Choice Award , and  Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress , amongst other accolades. [67] [68] [69] [70]  It was her fourth Academy Award nomination. [71] \n In 2014, Roberts narrated \"Women in Hollywood\", an episode of season 2 of  Makers: Women Who Make America . [72]  Roberts appears in  Givenchy 's spring/summer 2015 campaign. [73] [74]  In 2016, she starred in the film  Mother's Day . [75] \n In June 2017, Roberts announced she will be starring in a limited series for HBO, based on the  Maria Semple  novel,  Today Will Be Different . This will be Roberts' first television series. [76] \n Film production [ edit ] \n Roberts runs the production company Red Om Films with her sister,  Lisa Roberts Gillan , and Marisa Yeres Gill. [77]  Through Red Om, Roberts served as an executive producer of the first four films of the  American Girl  film series (based on the  American Girl  line of dolls), released between 2004 and 2008. [78] \n Personal life [ edit ] \n Relationships and marriages [ edit ] \n Roberts reportedly had romantic relationships with actors  Jason Patric ,  Liam Neeson ,  Kiefer Sutherland ,  Dylan McDermott , and  Matthew Perry . [79] [80]  She was briefly engaged to Sutherland; they broke up three days before their scheduled wedding on June 11, 1991. [81]  On June 25, 1993, she married country singer  Lyle Lovett ; the wedding took place at St. James Lutheran Church in  Marion, Indiana . [82]  They separated in March 1995 and subsequently divorced. [83]  From 1998 to 2001, Roberts dated actor  Benjamin Bratt . [84] \n Roberts and her husband, cameraman  Daniel Moder , met on the set of her film  The Mexican  in 2000 while she was still dating Bratt. At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg. He filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalized, he and Roberts wed on July 4, 2002, [85]  at her ranch in  Taos, New Mexico . [86]  Together, they have three children: twins Hazel Patricia and Phinnaeus \"Finn\" Walter Moder (born November 28, 2004) [87]  and son, Henry Daniel Moder (born June 18, 2007). [88] \n Religious beliefs [ edit ] \nDeployed troops show Roberts the controls of an  F-15 . \n Roberts disclosed in a 2010 interview for  Elle  magazine that she believes in and practices  Hinduism . [89]  Roberts is a devotee of the guru  Neem Karoli Baba  (Maharaj-ji), a picture of whom drew Roberts to Hinduism. [90] \n In September 2009, Swami Daram Dev of Ashram Hari Mandir in  Pataudi , where Roberts was shooting  Eat Pray Love , gave her children new names after Hindu gods:  Laxmi  for Hazel,  Ganesh  for Phinnaeus and  Krishna   Balram  for Henry. [91] \n Charities [ edit ] \n Roberts has given her time and resources to  UNICEF  as well as to other charitable organizations. On May 10, 1995, Roberts arrived in  Port-au-Prince , as she said, \"to educate myself\". [92] [93]  The poverty she found was overwhelming. \"My heart is just bursting\", she said. [92]  UNICEF officials hoped that her six-day visit would trigger an outburst of giving: US$10\u00a0million in aid was sought at the time. [92] [93] \n In 2000, Roberts narrated  Silent Angels , a documentary about  Rett syndrome , a neurodevelopmental disorder, which was shot in Los Angeles, Baltimore and New York. The documentary was designed to help raise public awareness about the disease. In July 2006, Earth Biofuels announced Roberts as a spokeswoman for the company and as chair of the company's newly formed Advisory Board promoting the use of renewable fuels. She also supports  Gucci 's \"Chime For Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. [94] \n Roberts was the voice of  Mother Nature  in a 2014 short film for  Conservation International , intended to raise awareness about  climate change .
