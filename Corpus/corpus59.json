Economists study the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services \u2500 essential knowledge for today\u2019s business people and policy makers. Blending both theory and practical applications, the Department of Economics serves students preparing for related specialized professions (honours, specialization, co-operative) as well as those interested in a generalized understanding of the discipline (major, minor programs). \n Programs \n Students are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements. \n Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits. \n The superscript indicates credit value. \n NOTE: Calculus I is a prerequisite for many Economics courses. Students who have not taken MATH 209 or equivalent must take it as an elective within their first 15 credits. \n Undergraduate Program Director \nCAROL CHUI-HA LAU \n BA DEGREE PROGRAMS IN ECONOMICS \n \u00a0 60\u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   BA Honours in Economics \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage I \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0 * ECON 201 3 , 203 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0** ECON 221 3 , 222 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage II \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 301 3 , 302 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 303 3 , 304 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 325 3 , 326 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 324 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chosen from ECON 318 3 , 319 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage III \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 401 3 , 403 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 421 3 , 422 3 \n\u00a0 12 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 400-level ECON elective credits \n \u00a0 60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BA Specialization in Economics \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage I \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0ECON 201 3 , 203 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0 **ECON 221 3 , 222 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage II \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 301 3 , 302 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 303 3 , 304 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chosen from ECON 318 3 , 319 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 324 3 , 325 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 300-level ECON elective credits \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage III \n\u00a0\u00a0 3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 421 3  or 423 3 \n\u00a021\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 400-level ECON elective credits \n \u00a0 42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BA Major in Economics \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage I \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *ECON 201 3 , 203 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0 **ECON 221 3 , 222 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage II \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 301 3 , 302 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ECON 303 3 , 304 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chosen from ECON 318 3 , 319 3 , 324 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 300-level ECON elective credits \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage III \n\u00a0 12 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 400-level ECON credits \n \u00a0 30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minor in Economics \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage I \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *ECON 201 3 , 203 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage II \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 ECON 318 3 , 319 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 200- or 300-level ECON elective credits \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stage III \n\u00a0 12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 300- or 400-level ECON elective credits \n *Students exempted from ECON 201 and/or 203 are required to replace these courses with ECON elective credits. \n **Any equivalent six credits satisfy this component of the program. \n \u00a0 24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minor in Analytical Economics \n NOTE: MATH 203 or 209; MAST 221; or equivalent are prerequisites for this program.
