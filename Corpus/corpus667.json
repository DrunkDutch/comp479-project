K. Rowling .  Daniel Radcliffe ,  Rupert Grint  and  Emma Watson  have played  Harry Potter ,  Ron Weasley  and  Hermione Granger  in all the films. When they were cast only Radcliffe had previously acted in a film. Complementing them on screen are such actors as  Helena Bonham Carter ,  Jim Broadbent ,  John Cleese ,  Robbie Coltrane ,  Warwick Davis ,  Ralph Fiennes ,  Michael Gambon ,  Brendan Gleeson ,  Richard Griffiths ,  Richard Harris ,  John Hurt ,  Jason Isaacs ,  Miriam Margolyes ,  Helen McCrory ,  Gary Oldman ,  Alan Rickman ,  Fiona Shaw ,  Maggie Smith ,  Timothy Spall ,  Imelda Staunton ,  David Thewlis ,  Emma Thompson , and  Julie Walters , among others. Thirteen actors have appeared as the same character in all eight films of the series. \n Some well-known British actors, who have not appeared in the series, were asked in jest why they had not been cast. When  David Yates  was directing the fifth film,  Bill Nighy  (who knew Yates personally) said that he hoped the director would cast him in  Harry Potter . \"But nobody called\", Nighy added. [1]  However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic  Rufus Scrimgeour  in the seventh film. Nighy said, \"I am no longer the only English actor not to be in  Harry Potter  and I am very pleased.\" [2]   Jude Law  once quipped, \"Nobody's asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry.\" [3]  When a reporter compared Potions professor  Horace Slughorn 's obsession with famous names to the series' connection to \"every notable British actor\" in 2009,  Jim Broadbent  (who plays Slughorn) said, \"Well, not  every  actor gets invited. I know some who are still waiting.\" [4] \n J. K. Rowling gave a speech during the world premiere of the final film in the series,  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 , on 7 July 2011 in  London . Rowling praised the film series' acting talent and announced that there are seven young  Harry Potter  cast members who she refers to as \"The Big Seven\"; they are  Daniel Radcliffe ,  Rupert Grint ,  Emma Watson ,  Tom Felton ,  Matthew Lewis ,  Evanna Lynch  and  Bonnie Wright .

[15] [16]  The given names of each of the Saunders triplets are unknown; they were credited in the film as \"Saunders triplets\". \n B   Michael Gambon  replaced  Richard Harris  as  Albus Dumbledore  from  Prisoner of Azkaban  onwards after Harris's death. [17] \n C   Warwick Davis  played  Filius Flitwick  in the first two films as an old dwarf-like man with gray hair. In pre-production for the third film, the producers told Davis there was no role for Flitwick, but that they would like to have him play somebody else, at least for a cameo. Davis played a much younger-looking man with black hair and a moustache who directed the choir at the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, and was credited as portraying \"Wizard\". During pre-production for the fourth film, director  Mike Newell  told Davis he wanted to keep his look from the last film but make this the new look for Flitwick. Davis now considers the character he has played some relative of Flitwick, though he is still credited as \"Filius Flitwick\". In the sixth film, Harry specifically calls him Professor Flitwick, as does McGonagall in the seventh, calling him Filius. \n D   Rob Knox  was stabbed to death on 24 May 2008 before  Half-Blood Prince  was released. [18]  The cast and crew of  Half-Blood Prince  wore white ribbons to the London premiere of the film in tribute to Knox. [19] \n E   Vincent Crabbe  is a recurring, minor character who appears in every book and dies in a pivotal scene in  Deathly Hallows .  Jamie Waylett  portrays the character in the first six films. During production of the seventh film, Waylett pleaded guilty to charges of growing  marijuana . [20]   Joshua Herdman , who plays Crabbe's best friend  Gregory Goyle , said in August 2009 that Waylett would not be reprising his role and Herdman's character would die instead. \n F  A scene with a young  Lily Potter  was filmed for  Order of the Phoenix  but ended up being cut from the theatrical version. \n G  A few scenes with the young Lucius Malfoy, portrayed by Tony Coburn, were shot for  Half Blood Prince  but were eventually cut from the film. \n H  Viktor Krum made an appearance at Bill and Fleur's wedding, but his part was cut from the final film. \n I  A scene with  Peeves  was filmed for  Philosopher's Stone  but ended up being cut from the theatrical version.
