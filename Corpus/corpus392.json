Sunlight  forms a light beam (a sunbeam) when filtered through media such as  clouds ,  foliage , or  windows . To artificially produce a light beam, a  lamp  and a  parabolic reflector  is used in many  lighting  devices such as  spotlights ,  car headlights ,  PAR Cans  and  LED  housings. Light from certain types of  laser  has the smallest possible  beam divergence . \n Contents \n 1   Visible light beams \n 1.1   Visibility from the side as side effect \n 1.2   Visibility from the side as purpose \n 2   Other applications \n 3   See also \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n Visible light beams [ edit ] \nA natural lightbeam in the  Majlis al-Jinn  (literally 'Meeting place of the  jinn ') cave in  Oman \n From the side, a beam of light is only visible if part of the light is scattered by objects: tiny particles like  dust , water droplets ( mist ,  fog ,  rain ),  hail ,  snow , or  smoke , or larger objects such as  birds . If there are many objects in the light path, then it appears as a continuous beam, but if there are only a few objects, then the light is visible as a few individual bright points. In any case, this scattering of light from a beam, and the resultant visibility of a light beam from the side, is known as the  Tyndall effect . \n Visibility from the side as side effect [ edit ] \n Flashlight  (UK 'Torch'), beam directed by hand \n Headlight , forward beam; the lamp is mounted in a vehicle, or on the forehead of a person, e.g. built into a  helmet \n Lighthouse , beam sweeping around horizontally \n Searchlight , beam directed at something \n Visibility from the side as purpose [ edit ] \n For the purpose of visibility of light beams from the side, sometimes a  haze machine  or  fog machine  is used. The difference between the two is that the fog itself is also a  visual effect . \nBeams shining through water-based haze in a photo studio setting. \nLaser beams used for visual effects during a musical performance \n Laser lighting display -  Laser  beams are often used for visual effects, often in combination with music. \n Searchlights are often used in  advertising , for instance by  automobile  dealers; the beam of light is visible over a large area, and (at least in theory) interested persons can find the dealer or store by following the beam to its source. This also used to be done for  movie   premieres ; the waving searchlight beams are still to be seen as a design element in the logo of the  20th Century Fox   movie studio . \n Other applications [ edit ] \n Optical communication \n Infrared Data Association  (IrDA) standards \n Infrared remote control \n Intrusion alarm#Photo-electric beams \n People counter#Infrared beams \n Fibre optics \n Laser pointer \n Laser sight \n List of applications for lasers \n See also [ edit ] \n Ray (optics) \n Pencil beam \n Crepuscular rays \n Light pillar , atmospheric optical phenomena \n Relativistic beaming \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Guinness world record for harbour show (21 Nov 2005) \n External links [ edit ] \n A short video showing how you can put sound on a light beam and transmit it by the Vega Science Trust \n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Light_beam&oldid=789058511 \"\t\t\t\t\t \n Categories :  Light Geometrical optics Hidden categories:  Articles needing additional references from April 2010 All articles needing additional references   \n Navigation menu \n Personal tools \n Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in   \n Namespaces \n Article Talk   \n Variants \n Views \n Read Edit View history   \n More \n Search \n Navigation \n Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store   \n Interaction \n Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page   \n Tools \n What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item Cite this page   \n Print/export \n Create a book Download as PDF Printable version   \n Languages \n \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0448\u0430 Nederlands \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 Simple English Sloven\u010dina Sloven\u0161\u010dina T\u00fcrk\u00e7e \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430   \n Edit links   \n  This page was last edited on 5 July 2017, at 02:41. \n Text is available under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.
