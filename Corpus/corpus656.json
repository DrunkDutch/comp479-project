The movie was announced in 1956 and inspired by the story of the  Tsavo maneaters  recounted in the 1955 book  African Bush Adventures  by  J.A. Hunter  and  Daniel P. Mannix . [3] \n The screenplay was originally by  Peter Viertel , who had worked on  The African Queen , and written a novel of the experiences called  White Hunter, Black Heart .  Alan Ladd , who had made three films for Warwick, was the announced as male lead - it was meant to be part of a six-picture deal between Ladd and Warwick that also included  The Man Inside  and  It's Always Four O'Clock . [4]  In the final event Ladd made no further films for Warwick - the lead role went to Robert Taylor. \n Filming took place on location in Moshi Tanganyika, the same location used for  Mogambo  and  Tarzan's Greatest Adventure . [5] \n Release [ edit ] \n The film's title was changed to  Killers of Kilimanjaro . This upset Chief Thomas Marealle of the Chagga tribe, on whose lands the film was shot, and he made an official complaint. [6]   Mount Kilimanjaro  lies about 125 kilometres (78\u00a0mi) west of Tsavo in Tanzania. \n See also [ edit ] \n Men Against the Sun  (1952) \n References [ edit ] \n ^   http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/38998 \n ^   \"KILLERS\" KILL THE CHIEF'S ENTHUSIASM: BRITISH FILM TITLE\"  The Guardian  01 Sep 1959: 11 \n ^   WARWICK TO MAKE 2 FILMS IN AFRICA: Company Plans Productions of 'Adamson of Africa' and 'Golden City,' a Musical M-G-M Misses One of Four By OSCAR GODBOUT Special to The New York Times..
