To this end, Snap Inc. has established a three-pronged approach to evaluate and eradicate risks related to slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking in our supply chain for branded products. This statement, published in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015, reflects Snap\u2019s progress during the 2016 fiscal year. \n Policies.  Our commitment is set forth in our  Supplier Code of Business Conduct . The Code requires suppliers to commit not to use slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking; to ensure that their own suppliers follow the same rules; and to let Snap conduct assessments to ensure compliance. \n Training.  Snap provides training to our employees who interact with our supply chain. This training underscores our stand against slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking. It also helps to ensure that our employees will be able to recognize, and will know how to report, any human-rights violations and \u201cred flags\u201d at supplier sites. \n Verification.
