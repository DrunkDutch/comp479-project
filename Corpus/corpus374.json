For current and future events, use phrases like  as of November 2017  or  since the beginning of 2017  to signal the time-dependence of the information. Using  {{ as of |2017}}  will produce the text  As of 2017 [update]  , with the additional benefit of putting the article in a category flagging it for periodic review. A full date is specified with  {{as of|2017|11|23}} . However, do not replace  since the beginning of 2005  with  {{as of|2005}}  because some information (the  beginning  of 2005) would be lost; instead, make use of the template's alternate-text parameter:  {{ as of |2005|alt=since the beginning of 2005}} . \n Relative-time expressions are acceptable for very long periods, such as geological epochs:  Humans diverged from other primates long ago, but  only recently developed state legislatures . \n Times of day [ edit ] \n Shortcut \n MOS:TIME \n Context determines whether the  12-  or  24-hour  clock is used. In all cases, colons separate hours, minutes and (where present) seconds, e.g.  1:38:09 \u00a0 pm  or  13:38:09 . Use figures ( 12:45 \u00a0 p.m. ) rather than words ( twelve forty-five p.m. ). \n 12-hour clock times  end with lower-case  a.m.  or  p.m. , or  am  or  pm , preceded by a  non-breaking space , e.g.  2:30 \u00a0 p.m.  or  2:30 \u00a0 pm  (markup:  2:30{{ nbsp }}p.m.  or  2:30{{ nbsp }}pm ), not  2:30p.m.  or  2:30pm . Hours should not have a leading zero (e.g.  2:30 \u00a0 p.m. , not  02:30 \u00a0 p.m. ). Usually, use  noon  and  midnight  rather than  12 pm  and  12 am ; whether \"midnight\" refers to the start or the end of a date should be explicitly specified unless clear from the context. \n 24-hour clock times  have no a.m., p.m., noon or midnight suffix, and include a colon ( 15:30  not  1530 ). Hours under 10 should have a leading zero ( 08:15 ). The time  00:00  refers to midnight at the start of a date,  12:00  to noon, and  24:00  to midnight at the end of a date, but  24  should not be used for the first hour of the next day (e.g. use  00:10  for ten minutes after midnight, not  24:10 ). \n Time zones \n Shortcut \n MOS:TIMEZONE \n Give dates and times appropriate to the  time zone  where an event took place. For example, the date of the  attack on Pearl Harbor  should be December \u00a0 7, 1941 (Hawaii time/\u200bdate). Give priority to the place at which the event had its most significant effects; for example, if a hacker based in China attacked a Pentagon computer in the US, use the time zone for the Pentagon, where the attack had its effect. In some cases, the best solution may be to add the date and time in  Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC). For example: \n \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0  8 \u00a0 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time  on January \u00a0 15, 2001 (01:00 \u00a0 UTC, January \u00a0 16) \n Alternatively, include just the  UTC offset : \n \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 21:00 \u00a0 British Summer Time  ( UTC+1 ) on 27 \u00a0 July 2012 \n Rarely, the time zone in which a historical event took place has since changed; for example, China to 1949 was divided into  five time zones , whereas all of modern China is  UTC+8 . Similarly, the term \"UTC\" is not appropriate for dates before this system was adopted in 1960; [2]   Universal Time  (UT) is the appropriate term for the mean time at the  prime meridian (Greenwich)  when it is unnecessary to specify the precise definition of the time scale. Be sure to show the UTC or offset appropriate to the clock time in use at the time of the event, not the modern time zone, if they differ. \n  Dates, months and years [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n WP:YEAR \n MOS:DATE \n MOS:DATEFORMAT \n These requirements do not apply to dates in quotations or titles;  see  Wikipedia:Manual of Style \u00a7\u00a0Quotations .

(20 September 2008) \n Jones, J. (September 20, 2008) \n Access and archive dates  in an article's citations should all use the same format, which may be: \n the format used for publication dates in the article; \n the format expected in the citation style adopted in the article (e.g.  20 Sep 2008 );  or \n yyyy - mm - dd \n For example, access/archive dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats (among others):\n Jones, J. (September 20, 2008) \u00a0 ... Retrieved February 5, 2009. \n Jones, J. (20 Sep 2008) \u00a0 ... Retrieved 5 Feb 2009. \n Jones, J. (20 September 2008) \u00a0 ... Retrieved 2009-02-05. \n When a citation style does not expect differing date formats, it is permissible to normalize publication dates to the article body text date format, and/or access/archive dates to either, with date consistency being preferred. \n Strong national ties to a topic [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:DATETIES \n WP:MILFORMAT \n See also:  Wikipedia:Manual of Style \u00a7\u00a0Strong national ties to a topic \n Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the date format most commonly used in that nation. For the United States this is (for example)  July 4, 1976 ; for most other English-speaking countries it is  4 July 1976 \n Articles related to Canada may use either format with (as always) consistency within each article.  (See \u00a7\u2009 Retaining existing format , below.) \n In some topic areas, the customary format differs from the usual national one: for example, articles on the modern U.S. military, including U.S. military biographical articles, use day-before-month, in accordance with U.S. military usage. \n Retaining existing format [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:DATERET \n MOS:DATEVAR \n See also:  Wikipedia:Manual of Style \u00a7\u00a0Retaining the existing variety \n If an article has evolved using predominantly one date format, this format should be used throughout the article, unless there are reasons for changing it based on strong national ties to the topic or consensus on the article's talk page. \n The date format chosen by the first major contributor in the early stages of an article should continue to be used, unless there is reason to change it based on strong national ties to the topic or consensus on the article's talk page. \n Where an article has shown no clear sign of which format is used, the first person to insert a date is equivalent to \"the first major contributor\". \n Era style [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:ERA \n MOS:BCE \n The default  calendar era  is the  Western Dionysian era system , a year numbering system also known as the Western Christian era (represented by  BC and AD ), or the  Common Era  (represented by  BCE and CE ).\n BC  and  AD  are the traditional ways of designating eras.  BCE  and  CE  are common in some scholarly texts and in certain topic areas. Either convention may be appropriate for use in Wikipedia articles.\n Use either the BC\u2013AD or the BCE\u2013CE notation consistently within the same article. Exception: do not change  direct quotations , titles, etc. \n Do not change the established era style in an article unless there are reasons specific to its content. Seek consensus on the talk page  before  making the change. Open the discussion under a subhead that uses the word \"era\". Briefly state why the style is inappropriate for the article in question. A personal or categorical preference for one era style over the other is not justification for making a change. \n BCE  and  CE  or  BC  and  AD  are written in upper case, unspaced, without a period (full point,  . ), and separated from the numeric year by a space ( 5 \u00a0 BC , not  5BC ). It is advisable to use a  non-breaking space . \n AD  may appear before or after a year ( AD \u00a0 106 ,  106 \u00a0 AD ); the other abbreviations appear only after ( 106 \u00a0 CE ,  3700 \u00a0 BCE ,  3700 \u00a0 BC ). \n In general, do not use  CE  or  AD  unless required to avoid ambiguity (e.g.  The Norman Conquest took place in 1066  not  1066 \u00a0 CE  nor  AD \u00a0 1066 ) or awkwardness  ( January 1, 1 AD  not  January 1, 1 ).  On the other hand,  Plotinus  lived at the end of the 3rd century AD  will avoid confusion, and depending on context one- and two-digit years may look more natural with an era marker ( born in 2 \u00a0 AD ). Also, in  He did not become king until 55 \u00a0 CE  the era marker makes it clear that  55  does not refer to the new king's age (or write  He did not become king until the year 55 ). If the era is shown for the initial date in a range, then use it for the final date as well: not  from 450 BCE to 200  but  from 450 to 200 BCE  or  from 450 BCE to 200 BCE  (and definitely  from 100 BCE to 200 CE ).  (See \u00a7\u2009 Ranges , below.) \n Uncalibrated (bce) radiocarbon dates:   Calibrated and uncalibrated  dates can diverge widely, and some sources distinguish the two only via  BCE  or  BC  (for calibrated dates) versus  bce ,  bc  or  b.c.  (uncalibrated). Avoid giving uncalibrated dates except in direct quotations, and even then a footnote or square-bracketed note [like this] should note that the date is uncalibrated or (ideally) give the calibrated date. \n BP or YBP : In scientific and academic contexts, BP (before present) or YBP (years before present) are often used. ( Present  in this context conventionally refers to January \u00a0 1, 1950.) Write  3000 years \u00a0 BP  or  3000 \u00a0 YBP  or  3000 \u00a0 years before present  but not forms such as  3000 before present  and  3000 years before the present . If one of the abbreviated forms is used, link to  Before present  on first use:  The Jones artifact was dated to 4000 \u00a0 YBP , the Smith artifact to 5000 YBP. \n Other era systems  may be appropriate in an article. In such cases, dates should be followed by a conversion to Dionysian (or vice versa) and the first instance should be linked:  Qasr-al-Khalifa was built in  221 \u00a0 AH  (836 \u00a0 CE) , or  in 836 \u00a0 AD (221 \u00a0 AH ) .\n Astronomical year numbering  follows the Common Era and does not require conversion, but the first instance of a non-positive year should still be linked:  The March equinox passed into Pisces in  year \u00a0 \u221267 . \n Julian and Gregorian calendars [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:OSNS \n MOS:JG \n See also:  Old Style and New Style dates \n A date can be given in any appropriate calendar, as long as it is (at the minimum) given in the  Julian calendar  or the  Gregorian calendar  or both, as described below. For example, an article on the early  history of Islam  may give dates in both  Islamic  and Julian calendars. Where a calendar other than the Julian or Gregorian is used, the article must make this clear. \n Current events are dated using the Gregorian calendar. \n Dates of events in countries using the Gregorian calendar at that time are given in the Gregorian calendar. This includes some of the  Continent of Europe from 1582 , the  British Empire  from 14 \u00a0 September 1752, and Russia from 14 \u00a0 February 1918  (see  Adoption of the Gregorian calendar ) . \n Dates before 15 \u00a0 October 1582 (when the Gregorian calendar was first adopted in some places) are normally given in the Julian calendar. The Julian day and month should not be converted to the Gregorian calendar, but the start of the  Julian year  should be assumed to be 1 \u00a0 January  (see below for more details) . \n Dates for Roman history before 45 \u00a0 BC are given in the  Roman calendar , which was neither Julian nor Gregorian. When (rarely) the Julian equivalent is certain, it may be included. \n For dates in early Egyptian and Mesopotamian history, Julian or Gregorian equivalents are often uncertain.

For example, in England and its colonies until 1752, the year began on  Annunciation Day , 25 \u00a0 March;  see the  New Year article  for other styles . In writing about historical events, however, years should be assumed to have begun on 1 \u00a0 January  (see the example of the execution of Charles I in \" Differences in the start of the year \") ; if there is reason to use another start-of-year date, this should be noted. \n If there is a need to mention  Old or New Style  dates in an article (as in the  Glorious Revolution ), a footnote should be provided on the first usage, stating whether the New Style refers to a start of year adjustment or to the Gregorian calendar (it can mean either). \n Ranges [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:DOB \n MOS:OTHERDATE \n MOS:DATERANGE \n Note: A change from a preference for two digits, to a preference for four digits, on the right side of  year\u2013year  ranges was implemented in July 2016 per  this RFC . \n Use a dash, or a word such as  from  or  between , but not both:  from 1881 to 1886  (not  from 1881\u20131886 ); \u00a0   between June \u00a0 1 and July \u00a0 3  (not  between June \u00a0 1\u00a0\u2013 July \u00a0 3 ) \n A simple  year\u2013year  range is written using an en dash ( &ndash;  or  {{ ndash }} ) not a hyphen or slash; this dash is usually  unspaced  (that is, with no space on either side); and the range's end year is usually given in full: \n \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0  1881\u20131886 ; \u00a0   1881\u20131992  (not  1881\u201386 ; \u00a0   1881\u00a0\u2013 1992 )\n Markup:  1881{{ ndash }}1886  or  1881&ndash;1886 \n Two-digit ending years  ( 1881\u201382 , but never  1881\u2013882  or  1881\u20132 )  may  be used in any of the following cases: (1)  two consecutive years;  (2) infoboxes and tables where space is limited (using a single format consistently in any given table column); and (3) in certain topic areas if there is a very good reason, such as matching the established convention of reliable sources. \n The  slash notation  ( 2005/2006 ) may be used to signify a fiscal year or other special period, if that convention is used in reliable sources. \n Other \"simple\" ranges use an  unspaced  en dash as well: \n day\u2013day :  5\u20137 \u00a0 January 1979 ; \u00a0   January \u00a0 5\u20137, 1979 ; \u00a0   elections were held March 5\u20138 \n month\u2013month :  the 1940 peak period was May\u2013July ; \u00a0   the peak period was May\u2013July \u00a0 1940 ; \u00a0  (but  the peak period was  May 1940\u00a0\u2013 July  1940  uses a  spaced  en dash;  see below ) \n If at least one of the items on either side of the en dash contains a space, then a  spaced  en dash ( {{ snd }} ) is used: \n between specific dates in different months :  They travelled  June \u00a0 3\u00a0\u2013 August \u00a0 18,  1952 ; \u00a0   They travelled 3 \u00a0 June\u00a0\u2013 18 \u00a0 August 1952 \n between dates in different years : \n Charles Robert Darwin  (12 \u00a0 February  1809\u00a0\u2013 19 \u00a0 April  1882) was an English naturalist \u00a0 ... \n Markup:  12{{ nbsp }}February 1809{{ snd }}19{{ nbsp }}April 1882  or  12&nbsp;February 1809&nbsp;&ndash; 19&nbsp;April 1882 \n Abraham Lincoln  (February \u00a0 12, 1809\u00a0\u2013 April \u00a0 15, 1865) was the 16th President of \u00a0 ... \n between months in different years :  The exception was in force August  1892\u00a0\u2013 January  1903 ; \u00a0   The Ghent Incursion (March 1822\u00a0\u2013 January \u00a0 1, 1823) was ended by the New Year's Treaty \n Markup:  March 1822{{ snd }}January{{ nbsp }}1, 1823  or  March 1822&nbsp;&ndash; January&nbsp;1, 1823 \n Where  circa  or other modifiers are used :  reigned c. 1393\u00a0\u2013 1414   (See \u00a7\u2009 Uncertain, incomplete, or approximate dates , below.) \n Constructions such as  1982\u2013present  (with unspaced ndash),  January 1, 2011\u00a0\u2013 present  (spaced ndash), or  January 2011\u00a0\u2013 present  (spaced ndash) may be used where appropriate, but other constructions may be more appropriate in prose  (see  \u00a7\u00a0Statements likely to become outdated ) .

When used adjectivally they contain a hyphen ( nineteenth-century painting  or  19th-century  painting ). Do not capitalize ( the best Nineteenth-century paintings ; \u00a0   during the Nineteenth Century ). \n See  WP:Manual of Style \u00a7\u00a0En dashes  for use of hyphens and dashes in obscure situations. \n Long periods of time [ edit ] \n When the term is frequent, combine  yr \u00a0 (years) or  ya \u00a0 (years ago) with  k \u00a0 (thousand):  kya ,  kyr ;  M \u00a0 (million):  Mya ,  Myr ; and  b \u00a0 ( short-scale  billion):  bya ,  byr .

Numbers between 21 and 99 are hyphenated (including when part of a larger number):  fifty-six  or  fifty-six thousand  but  five \u00a0 hundred  or  five \u00a0 thousand . \n Other numbers are given in numerals ( 3.75 ,  544 ) or in forms such as  21 \u00a0 million . Markup:  21{{nbsp}}million \n Billion  and  trillion  are understood to represent their  short-scale  values of 10 9 \u00a0 (1,000,000,000) and 10 12 \u00a0 (1,000,000,000,000), respectively. Keep this in mind when translating articles from non-English Wikipedias, or using material from non-English or older sources. \n M  (unspaced) or  bn  (unspaced) respectively may be used for \"million\" or \"billion\" after a number, when the word has been spelled out at the first occurrence ( She received \u00a370 \u00a0 million and her son \u00a310M ). \n SI prefixes and symbols, such as  mega- \u00a0 ( M ),  giga- \u00a0 ( G ) and  tera- \u00a0 ( T ), should be used only with units of measure as appropriate to the field, and not to express large quantities in other contexts. Examples of misuse:  In a population of 1.3G \u00a0 people, 300 \u00a0 megadeaths would be expected. \n Sometimes, the  variety of English  used in an article may necessitate the use of a numbering system other than the Western thousands-based system. For example, the  South Asian numbering system  is conventionally used in  South Asian English . In those situations, link the first spelled-out instance of each quantity (e.g.  [[crore]] , which yields:  crore ).\n If no instances are spelled out, provide a note after the first instance, directing the reader to the article about the numbering system. Also, provide a conversion to Western numbers for the first instance of each quantity, and provide conversions for subsequent instances if they do not overwhelm the content of the article. For example, write  three  crore  (thirty million) . \n Group digits in Western thousands-based style (e.g.,  30,000,000 ; not  3,00,00,000 );  see  \u00a7\u00a0Delimiting (grouping of digits) , below . \n The variety of English does not uniquely determine the method of numbering in an article. Other considerations\u00a0\u2013 such as conventions used in mathematics, science, and engineering\u00a0\u2013 may also apply. The choice and order of formats and conversions is a matter of editorial discretion and consensus at the article. \n Shortcut \n MOS:NUMNOTES \n Notes and exceptions: \n Avoid beginning a sentence with a figure:\n Use:  There were many matches ;  23 ended in a draw.

(Nor:  Nineteen forty-five and 1950 elections were held.  Comparable numbers should be both written in words or both in figures.) \n Opening a sentence with a proper name or technical term that begins with a numeral can usually be avoided by rewording:\n Prefer:  Typically, 1-Naphthylamine is synthesized via the Feldenshlager\u2013Glockenspiel process.  Or:  Feldenshlager\u2013Glockenspiel is the process typically used in the synthesis of 1-naphthylamine. \n Avoid:  1-Naphthylamine is typically synthesized via the Feldenshlager\u2013Glockenspiel process. \n In tables and infoboxes, quantities are expressed in figures ( Years in office: \u00a0 5 ); but numbers within a table's explanatory text and comments follow the general rule. \n Numbers in mathematical formulae are never spelled out ( 3 < \u03c0 < 22/7 , not  three < \u03c0 < 22 sevenths ). \n Sport scores and vote tallies should be given as figures, even if in the zero-to-nine range ( a 25\u20137 victory ; and  passed with 7 ayes, 2 nays, and 1 abstention ). \n Comparable quantities should be all spelled out or all in figures, even if one of the numbers would normally be written differently:  five cats and thirty-two dogs , or  5 cats and 32 dogs , not  five cats and 32 dogs \n Adjacent quantities not comparable should usually be in  different formats:   twelve 90-minute volumes  or  12 ninety-minute volumes , not  12 90-minute volumes  or  twelve ninety-minute volumes .\n Avoid awkward juxtapositions:  On February 25, 2011, twenty-one more were chosen , not  On February 25, 2011, 21 more were chosen . \n Sometimes figures and words carry different meanings; for example,  Every locker except one was searched  implies there is a single exception (without specifying which), while  Every locker except \u00a0 1 was searched  means that only locker number \u00a0 1 was not searched. \n Proper names, technical terms, and the like are never altered:  Seven Samurai , \u00a0   The Sixth Sense , \u00a0   5 \u00a0 Channel Street , \u00a0   Channel \u00a0 5 , \u00a0   Chanel No. \u00a0 5 , \u00a0   Fourth Estate , \u00a0   The Third Man , \u00a0   Second Judicial District , \u00a0   First Amendment , \u00a0   Zero Hour! \n Figures as figures: Use a figure when the figure itself (its  glyph , shape, etc.) is meant:  a figure-8 pattern ;  in the shape of the numeral  6 .

Please feel free to join in. This doesn't mean that you may not  be bold  in editing this section, but that it would be a good idea to check the discussion first. \n As with date ranges  (see  above ) , number ranges in general, such as page ranges, should state the full value of both the beginning and end of the range, with an  en dash  between, e.g.  pp. \u00a0 1902\u20131911 , \u00a0   entries \u00a0 342\u2013349 . Forms such as  1901\u201311  and  342\u20139  may be used where space is limited (such as in tables and infoboxes), or where a  citation style  formally requires it.

For the Microsoft Research project, see  Project Digits . \n Shortcuts \n WP:DIGITS \n MOS:DIGITS \n Digits should be grouped and separated either by commas or narrow gaps ( never  a period/full point). \n Grouping with commas \n Left of the decimal point, five or more digits are grouped into threes separated by commas (e.g. \u00a0 12,200 , \u00a0 255,200\u00a0km , \u00a0 8,274,527th , \u00a0 \u200a 1 \u2044 86,400 ). \n Numbers with exactly four digits left of the decimal point may optionally be grouped (either \u00a0 1,250  \u00a0or \u00a0 1250 ), provided that this is consistent within each article. \n When commas are used left of the decimal point, digits right of the decimal point are not grouped (i.e. should be given as an unbroken string). \n Markup:  {{ formatnum: }}  produces this formatting. \n Grouping with narrow gaps \n Digits are grouped both sides of the decimal point (e.g. \u00a0 7006654321012345600\u2660 6 543 210 .123 456 , \u00a0 7002793162340000000\u2660 520.012 34 \u00a0\u00b0C , \u00a0 7005101325000000000\u2660 101 325 / 760 ). \n Digits are generally grouped into threes. Right of the decimal point,  usual  practice is to have a final group of four in preference to leaving an 'orphaned' digit at the end ( 7001991234567000000\u2660 99.123 4567 , but  99.123 456 7  would also be acceptable). In mathematics-oriented articles long strings may be grouped into fives (e.g. \u00a0 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 ... ). \n This style is especially recommended for articles related to science, technology, engineering or mathematics. \n Markup: Templates  {{ val }}  or  {{ gaps }}  may be used to produce this formatting. Note that use of  any  space character in numbers, including non-breaking space, is problematic for  screen readers .  (See  \u00a7Non-breaking spaces .)  Screen readers read out each  group  of digits as separate numbers (e.g. \u00a0 30&thinsp;000 \u00a0 is read as \"thirty zero zero zero\".) \n Delimiting style should be consistent throughout a given article. \n Either use commas or narrow gaps, but not both in the same article. \n Either group the thousands in a four-digit number or do not, but not mixed use in the same article. \n However, grouping by threes and fives may coexist. \n An exception is made for four-digit page numbers or four-digit calendar years. These should never be grouped (not \u00a0 sailed in 1,492 , \u00a0though \u00a0 dynasty collapsed around 10,400\u00a0BC  \u00a0or \u00a0 by  7004137270000000000\u2660 13 727 \u00a0AD , Vega will be the northern pole star ). \n Percentages [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:PERCENT \n WP:PERCENT \n WP:% \n In the body of non-scientific/non-technical articles,  percent  (American English) or  per cent  (British English) are commonly used:  10 percent ;  ten percent ;  4.5 per cent .

For details on when and how to provide a conversion, see the section  \u00a7\u00a0Unit conversions . The choice of primary units depends on the circumstances, and should respect the principle of \" strong national ties \", where applicable: \n In  non-scientific articles relating to the United States , the primary units are  US customary , e.g.  97 \u00a0 pounds (44 \u00a0 kg) . \n In  non-scientific articles relating to the United Kingdom , the primary units for most quantities are metric or other internationally used units, [11]  except that:\n UK engineering-related articles, including those on bridges and tunnels, generally use the system of units that the topic was  drawn up  in (but road distances are given in imperial units, with a metric conversion \u2013 see next bullet); \n the primary units for distance/\u200blength, speed and fuel consumption are miles, miles per hour, and miles per imperial gallon (except for short distances or lengths, where miles are too large for practical use); \n the primary units for personal height and weight are feet\u200b/inches and stones/\u200bpounds; \n imperial pints are used for quantities of draught beer/\u200bcider and bottled milk; \n In  all other articles , the primary units chosen will be  SI  units,  non-SI units officially accepted for use with the SI , or such other units as are conventional in reliable-source discussions of the article topic (such as  revolutions per minute  (rpm) for  rotational speed ,  hands  for heights of horses, et cetera). \n Special considerations: \n Quantities set via definition (as opposed to measured quantities) should be given first in the units used in the definition, even if this makes the structure of presentation inconsistent:  During metrification, the speed limit was changed from 30 \u00a0 mph (48 \u00a0 km/h) to 50 \u00a0 km/h (31 \u00a0 mph) .\n Or use  about  to emphasize which is the statutory, exact value:  ...from 30 \u00a0 mph (about 48 \u00a0 km/h) to 50 \u00a0 km/h (about 31 \u00a0 mph) . \n Nominal quantities (e.g.  2 \u00a0 \u00d7 \u00a0 4   lumber ) require consideration of whether the article is concerned with the item's actual dimensions or merely with its function. In some cases, the nominal quantity may suffice; in others it may be necessary to give the nominal size (often in non-SI units), the actual size in non-SI units, and the actual size in SI units. \n Whenever a conversion is used, ensure that the precision of the converted quantity in the article is comparable to the precision of the value given by the source  (see  \u00a7\u00a0Unit conversions ) . \n Where the article's primary units differ from the units given in the source, the  {{ convert }}  template's  |order=flip  flag can be used; this causes the  original  unit to be shown as secondary in the article, and the  converted  unit to be shown as primary:  {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip}}  \u2192  The two cities are 320 kilometres (200\u00a0mi) apart. \n Unit conversions [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n MOS:CONVERSIONS \n WP:MOSCONVERSIONS \n Where English-speaking countries use different units for the same quantity, provide a conversion in parentheses:  the Mississippi River is 2,320 miles (3,734\u00a0km) long ;  the Murray River is 2,508 kilometres (1,558\u00a0mi) long . In science-related articles, however, supplying such conversion is not required unless there is some special reason to do so. \n Where an  imperial unit  is not part of the  US customary system , or vice versa\u00a0\u2013 and in particular, where those systems give a single term different definitions\u00a0\u2013 a double conversion may be appropriate:  Rosie weighed 80 kilograms (180\u00a0lb; 12\u00a0st 8\u00a0lb)  (markup:  {{convert|80|kg|lb stlb}} );  The car  had a fuel economy of 5\u00a0L/100\u00a0km (47\u00a0mpg \u2011US ; 56\u00a0mpg \u2011imp )  (markup:  {{convert|5|L/100km|mpgus mpgimp|abbr=on}} ). \n Generally, conversions to and from metric units and US or imperial units should be provided, except:\n When inserting a conversion would make a common or linked expression awkward ( The four-minute mile ). \n When units are part of the subject of a topic\u00a0\u2013 nautical miles in articles about the history of nautical law ( 5 nautical miles ),  SI  units in scientific articles ( a 600-kilometer asteroid ), yards in articles about American football\u00a0\u2013 it can be excessive to provide conversions every time a unit occurs. It might be best to note that this topic will use the units (possibly giving the conversion factor to another familiar unit in a parenthetical note or a footnote), and link the first occurrence of each unit but not give a conversion every time it occurs. \n Converted quantity values should use a  level of precision  similar to that of the source quantity value, so  the Moon is 380,000 \u00a0 kilometres (240,000 \u00a0 mi) from Earth , not  (236,121 \u00a0 mi) . Small numbers may need to be converted to a range where rounding would cause a significant distortion, so  one mile (1\u20132 \u00a0 km) , not  one mile (2 \u00a0 km) . Be careful especially when your source has already converted from the units you're now converting back to. This may be evidenced by multiples of common conversion factors in the data, such as 160 km (from 100 miles).  See  false precision . \n Conversion templates  can be used to convert and format many common units, including  {{ convert }} , which includes non-breaking spaces. \n In a  direct quotation , always retain the source units.

They may be based on a decimal system (like the standard  SI  prefixes), meaning 10 3 , 10 6 , 10 9 , 10 12 , etc., or they may be based on a binary system, meaning 2 10 , 2 20 , 2 30 , 2 40 , etc. The binary meanings are more commonly used in relation to solid-state memory (such as  RAM ), while the decimal meanings are more common for data transmission rates, disk storage and in theoretical calculations in modern academic textbooks. \n Prefixes for multiples of \n bits  (bit) or  bytes  (B) \n Decimal \n Value \n SI \n 1000 \n k \n kilo \n 1000 2 \n M \n mega \n 1000 3 \n G \n giga \n 1000 4 \n T \n tera \n 1000 5 \n P \n peta \n 1000 6 \n E \n exa \n 1000 7 \n Z \n zetta \n 1000 8 \n Y \n yotta \n Binary \n Value \n IEC \n JEDEC \n 1024 \n Ki \n kibi \n K \n kilo \n 1024 2 \n Mi \n mebi \n M \n mega \n 1024 3 \n Gi \n gibi \n G \n giga \n 1024 4 \n Ti \n tebi \n \u2013 \n 1024 5 \n Pi \n pebi \n \u2013 \n 1024 6 \n Ei \n exbi \n \u2013 \n 1024 7 \n Zi \n zebi \n \u2013 \n 1024 8 \n Yi \n yobi \n \u2013 \n v \n t \n e \n Follow these recommendations when using these prefixes in Wikipedia articles: \n Following the SI standard, a lower-case  k  should be used for \"kilo-\" whenever it means 1000 in computing contexts, whereas a capital  K  should be used instead to indicate the binary prefix for 1024 according to JEDEC. (If, under the exceptions detailed further below, the article otherwise uses IEC prefixes for binary units, use  Ki  instead). \n Do not assume that the binary or decimal meaning of prefixes will be obvious to everyone. Explicitly specify the meaning of k and K as well as the primary meaning of M, G, T, etc. in an article ( {{ BDprefix }}  is a convenient helper). Consistency within each article is desirable, but the need for consistency may be balanced with other considerations. \n The definition most relevant to the article should be chosen as primary for that article, e.g. specify a binary definition in an article on RAM, decimal definition in an article on  hard drives ,  bit rates , and a binary definition for Windows file sizes, despite files usually being stored on hard drives. \n Where consistency is not possible, specify wherever there is a deviation from the primary definition. \n Disambiguation should be shown in bytes or bits, with clear indication of whether in binary or decimal base. There is no preference in the way to indicate the number of bytes and bits, but the notation style should be consistent within an article. Acceptable examples include: \n \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 A 64 \u00a0 MB ( 64 \u00a0 \u00d7 \u00a0 1024 2 -byte)  video card and a 100 \u00a0 GB  (100 \u00a0 \u00d7 \u00a0 1000 3 -byte)  hard drive \n \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 A 64 \u00a0 MB ( 64 \u00a0 \u00d7 \u00a0 2 20 -byte)  video card and a 100 \u00a0 GB  (100 \u00a0 \u00d7 \u00a0 10 9 -byte)  hard drive \n \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 A 64 \u00a0 MB  (67,108,864-byte)  video card and a 100 \u00a0 GB  (100,000,000,000-byte)  hard drive \n Avoid inconsistent combinations such as  A 64 \u00a0 MB  (67,108,864-byte)  video card and a 100 \u00a0 GB  (100 \u00a0 \u00d7 \u00a0 1000 3 -byte)  hard drive . Footnotes, such as those seen in  Power Macintosh 5500 , may be used for disambiguation. \n Unless explicitly stated otherwise, one byte is eight bits  (see  Byte \u00a7\u00a0History ) . \n The  IEC prefixes   kibi-  (symbol  Ki ),  mebi-  ( Mi ),  gibi-  ( Gi ), etc., are generally not to be used except: [16] \n when the majority of cited sources on the article topic use IEC prefixes; \n in a direct quote using the IEC prefixes; \n when explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes; or \n in articles in which both types of prefix are used with neither clearly primary, or in which converting all quantities to one or the other type would be misleading or lose necessary precision, or declaring the actual meaning of a unit on each use would be impractical. \n  Currencies and monetary values [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n WP:$ \n WP:\u00a3 \n WP:\u20ac \n MOS:CURRENCY \n \"WP:CURRENCY\" redirects here. For the WikiProject focusing on articles about currencies, see  Wikipedia:WikiProject Numismatics . \n See also:  Wikipedia:WikiProject Numismatics/Style \u00a7\u00a0Article titles \n Choice of currency \n In  country-specific articles , such as  Economy of Australia , use the currency of the subject country. \n In  non-country-specific articles  such as  Wealth , use US dollars ( US$123  on first use, generally  $123  thereafter), euros ( \u20ac123 ), or pounds sterling ( \u00a3123 ). \n Currency names \n Do not capitalize the names or denominations of currencies, currency subdivisions, coins and banknotes: not  a Five-Dollar bill, four Quarters, and one Penny total six Dollars one Cent  but  a five-dollar bill, four quarters, and one penny total six dollars one cent .  Exception:  where otherwise required, as at the start of a sentence or in such forms as  Australian dollar . \n To pluralize  euro  use the standard English plurals ( ten euros and fifty cents ), not the  invariant plurals used for European Union legislation and banknotes  ( ten euro and fifty cent ). For the adjectival form, use a hyphenated singular: ( a two-euro pen and a ten-cent coin ). \n Link the first occurrence of lesser-known currencies ( Mongolian t\u00f6gr\u00f6gs ). \n Currency symbols \n In general, the first mention of a particular currency should use its full, unambiguous signifier (e.g.  A$52 ), with subsequent references using just the appropriate symbol (e.g.  $88 ), unless this would be unclear.  Exceptions: \n In an article referring to multiple currencies represented by the same symbol (e.g. the dollars of the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries\u00a0\u2013  see  Currency symbols \u00a7\u00a0dollar variants ) use the full signifier (e.g.  US$ ,  A$ ) each time, except (possibly) where a particular context makes this both unnecessary and undesirable. \n In articles entirely on EU-, UK- and/or US-related topics, all occurrences may be shortened ( \u20ac26 ,  \u00a322  or  $34 ), unless this would be unclear. \n The  pound sterling  is represented by the  \u00a3  symbol, with one horizontal bar. The double-barred  \u20a4  symbol is ambiguous, as it has also been used for the  Italian lira  and other currencies. For non-British currencies that use pounds or a pound symbol (e.g. the  Irish pound , IR\u00a3) use the symbol conventionally preferred for that currency. \n If there is no common English abbreviation or symbol, follow the  ISO 4217  standard.  See also  List of circulating currencies . \n Formatting \n A period (full stop,  . ) is used as the decimal point\u00a0\u2013 never a comma ( $6.57 , not  $6,57 ). \n For the grouping of digits (e.g.  \u00a31,234,567 ) see  \u00a7\u00a0Grouping of digits , above. \n Do not place a currency symbol  after  the accompanying numeric figures (e.g.  123$ ,  123\u00a3 ,  123\u20ac ) unless that is the normal convention for that symbol when writing in English:  smaller British coins include 1p, 2p, and 5p denominations . Never use forms such as  $US123  or  $123 (US) . \n Currency abbreviations that come before the numeric value are  unspaced  if they consist of a nonalphabetic symbol only, or end in a symbol ( \u00a3123 ; \u00a0 \u00a0   \u20ac123 ); but  spaced  if alphabetic ( R \u00a0 75 ). \n Ranges should be expressed giving the currency signifier just once:  $250\u2013300 , not  $250\u2013$300 . \n million  and  billion  should be spelled out on first use, and (optionally) abbreviated  M  or  bn  (both unspaced) thereafter:  She received \u00a370 million and her son \u00a310M ;  the school's share was $250\u2013300 million, and the charity's $400\u2013450M . \n In general, a currency symbol should be accompanied by a numeric amount e.g. not  He converted his US$ to A$  but  He converted his US dollars to Australian dollars  or  He exchanged the US$100 note for Australian dollars . \n Exceptions may occur in tables and infoboxes where space is limited e.g.  Currencies accepted for deposit:  US$ ,  SFr ,  GB\u00a3 ,  \u20ac . It may be appropriate to wikilink such uses, or add an explanatory note. \n Conversions \n Conversions of  less-familiar currencies  may be provided in terms of more familiar currencies\u00a0\u2013 such as the US dollar, euro or pound sterling\u00a0\u2013 using an appropriate rate (which is often  not  the current exchange rate). Conversions should be in parentheses after the original currency, rounding to avoid  false precision  (two significant digits is usually sufficient, as most exchange rates fluctuate significantly), with at least the year given as a rough point of conversion rate reference; e.g.  Since 2001 the grant has been 10,000,000  Swedish kronor  ($1.4M, \u20ac1.0M, or \u00a3800k as of August 2009 [update] ) , not  ($1,390,570, \u20ac971,673 or \u00a3848,646) . \n For  obsolete currencies , provide an equivalent (formatted as a conversion) if possible, in the modern replacement currency (e.g. decimal pounds for historical pre-decimal pounds-and-shillings), or a US-dollar equivalent where there is no modern equivalent. \n In some cases, it may be appropriate to provide a conversion accounting for inflation or deflation over time.  See  {{ Inflation }}  and  {{ Inflation-fn }} . \n Common mathematical symbols [ edit ] \n Shortcuts \n WP:COMMONMATH \n MOS:MINUS \n See also:  Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics \n The  Insert  menu below the editing window gives a more complete list of math symbols, and allows symbols to be inserted without the HTML encoding (e.g.  &divide; ) shown here. \n Spaces are placed to left and right when a symbol is used  with two operands , but no space is used when  there is one operand . \n Use  {{ var }}  or  <var>...</var>  for variable names:  {{var|base}} + {{var|ht}}  and  <var>base</var> + <var>ht</var>  both produce  base  +  ht . \n The  {{ nbsp }}  and  {{ nowrap }}  templates may be used to prevent awkward linebreaks. \n Common mathematical symbols \n Symbol name \n Example \n Markup \n Comments \n Plus / \npositive \n x  +  y \n {{var|x}} + {{var|y}} \n + y \n +{{var|y}} \n Minus / \nnegative \n x  \u2212  y \n {{var|x}} &minus; {{var|y}} \n Do not use hyphen ( - ) or dashes ( {{ ndash }}   or  {{ mdash }} ). \n \u2212 y \n &minus;{{var|y}} \n Plus-minus / \nminus-plus \n 41.5 \u00b1 0.3 \n 41.5 &plusmn; 0.3 \n \u2212(\u00b1 a ) = \u2213 a \n &minus;(&plusmn;{{var|a}}) = &#8723;{{var|a}} \n Multiplication , \ncross \n x  \u00d7  y \n {{var|x}} &times; {{var|y}} \n Do not use the letter  x  to indicate multiplication.

As long as the templates are adhered to, a robot performs the functions automatically. \n First,  obtain the coordinates . Avoid  excessive precision . \n The  {{ Coord }}  template offers users a choice of display format through  user styles , emits a  Geo microformat , and is recognised (in the  title  position) by the \"nearby\" feature of Wikipedia's mobile apps and by external service providers such as Google Maps and Google Earth, and Yahoo. Infoboxes automatically emit  {{ Coord }} . \n The following formats are available. \n For degrees only (including decimal values):  {{coord| dd | N/S | dd | E/W }} \n For degrees/minutes:  {{coord| dd | mm | N/S | dd | mm | E/W }} \n For degrees/minutes/seconds:  {{coord| dd | mm | ss | N/S | dd | mm | ss | E/W }} \n where: \n dd ,  mm ,  ss  are the degrees, minutes and seconds, respectively; \n N/S  is either  N  for northern or  S  for southern  latitudes ; \n E/W  is either  E  for eastern or  W  for western  longitudes ; \n negative values may be used in lieu of  S  and  W  to denote Southern and Western  Hemispheres \n For example: \n For the city of  Oslo , located at 59\u00b0 55\u2032 N, 10\u00b0 44\u2032 E: \n {{coord|59|55|N|10|44|E}} \u00a0\u2013 which becomes  59\u00b055\u2032N   10\u00b044\u2032E \ufeff / \ufeff 59.917\u00b0N 10.733\u00b0E \ufeff /  59.917; 10.733 \n For a country, like  Botswana , less precision is appropriate: \n {{coord|22|S|24|E}} \u00a0\u2013 which becomes  22\u00b0S   24\u00b0E \ufeff / \ufeff 22\u00b0S 24\u00b0E \ufeff /  -22; 24 \n Higher levels of precision are obtained by using seconds: \n {{coord|33|56|24|N|118|24|00|W}} \u00a0\u2013 which becomes  33\u00b056\u203224\u2033N   118\u00b024\u203200\u2033W \ufeff / \ufeff 33.94000\u00b0N 118.40000\u00b0W \ufeff /  33.94000; -118.40000 \n Coordinates can be entered as decimal values \n {{coord|33.94|S|118.40|W}} \u00a0\u2013 which becomes  33\u00b056\u2032S   118\u00b024\u2032W \ufeff / \ufeff 33.94\u00b0S 118.40\u00b0W \ufeff /  -33.94; -118.40 \n Increasing or decreasing the number of decimal places controls the precision. Trailing zeros should be used as needed to ensure that both values have the same level of precision. \n London Heathrow Airport ,  Amsterdam ,  Jan Mayen  and  Mount Baker  are examples of articles that contain geographical coordinates. \n Generally, the larger the object being mapped, the  less precise  the coordinates should be. For example, if just giving the location of a city, precision greater than 100 \u00a0 meters is not needed unless specifying a particular point in the city, for example the central administrative building. Specific buildings or other objects of similar size would justify precisions down to 10 \u00a0 meters or even one meter in some cases (1\u2032\u2032 ~15 \u00a0 m to 30 \u00a0 m, 0.0001\u00b0 ~5.6 \u00a0 m to 10 \u00a0 m). \n The final field, following the E/W, is available for attributes such as  type: ,  region: , or  scale:   (the codes are documented at  Template:Coord/doc#Coordinate parameters ) . \n When adding coordinates, please remove the  {{ coord missing }}  tag from the article, if present. \n For more information, see  the geographical coordinates WikiProject . \n Templates other than  {{ coord }}  should use the following variable names for coordinates:  lat_d ,  lat_m ,  lat_s ,  lat_NS ,  long_d ,  long_m ,  long_s ,  long_EW . \n See also [ edit ] \n Wikipedia:Naming conventions (numbers and dates) \n Wikipedia:Date formattings \n m:Help:Date formatting feature  at Meta \n m:Help:Calculation \u00a7\u00a0Displaying numbers and numeric expressions  at Meta \n Notes and references [ edit ] \n ^   Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk \u00a7\u00a0Principles ,  Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/jguk 2 \u00a7\u00a0Principles , and  Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sortan \u00a7\u00a0Principles \n ^   CCTF/09-32: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)   (PDF) .

Despite the IEC's 1998 international standard creating several new binary prefixes (e.g. mebi-, kibi-) to distinguish the meaning of the decimal  SI prefixes  (e.g.  mega-  and  kilo- , meaning 10 6  and 10 3  respectively) from the binary ones, and the subsequent incorporation of these IEC prefixes into the  ISO/IEC 80000 , consensus on Wikipedia in computing-related contexts currently favours the retention of the more familiar but ambiguous units  KB ,  MB ,  GB ,  TB ,  PB ,  EB , etc. over use of unambiguous IEC binary prefixes.
