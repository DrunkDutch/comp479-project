When you transfer from another accredited university to Concordia, we will consider placing you at an appropriate level within the undergraduate program of your choice. \n Transfer credit \n Academic credit may be awarded for university-level courses that are  equivalent to Concordia courses  and  appropriate to the program  you are applying to. \n In order for us to make an evaluation of transfer credit, we must receive a  formal application  and  all necessary supporting documents first \n Conditions for transfer credit \n There are, however, some special conditions attached to the granting of transfer credits. The number of credits awarded depends on the  character, quality and quantity  of the work completed. \n A  minimum of 45 credits , and in some cases  60 credits , must be taken at Concordia University. \n For more information on transferring from other post-secondary institutions refer to the\u00a0 Undergraduate Calendar . \nAlready a Concordia student? \u2014 Internal degree transfer \n Are you a Concordia student currently enrolled in a Bachelor\u2019s degree and wish to apply for a transfer into a different Bachelor\u2019s degree?\u00a0 (e.g. from a Bachelor of Commerce to Bachelor of Fine Arts or from Bachelor of Arts\u00a0 to a Bachelor of Engineering).\u00a0If you wish to apply to transfer from one degree to another, view  How to apply for a Degree Transfer . \n NOTE:  If you are currently in a Certificate or are Independent student who wishes to apply to enter a Bachelor\u2019s program you must  apply for admission . \n Degree transfer deadlines \n (for currently registered Concordia students in a Bachelor\u2019s degree program) \n \u00a0 \n Summer Term \n Fall Term \n Winter Term \n Faculty of Arts and Science \n N/A \n March 1 \n November 1 \n Faculty of Engineering & Computer Science* \n N/A \n March 1 \n November 1 \n Faculty of Fine Arts \n N/A \n March 1 \n N/A \n John Molson School of Business \n N/A \n March 1 \n N/A \n *Applications to Computation Arts must be submitted by the deadline dates stipulated by the Faculty of Fine Arts. \n Late applications will be considered if\u00a0 places are still available \u00a0 for the fall term only . \n Degree transfer requirements \n (for currently registered Concordia students in a Bachelor\u2019s degree program) \n                    Faculty of Arts and Science\r\n Students seeking transfer to the Faculty of Arts and Science (or those seeking to transfer from Arts to Science or vice-versa) are expected to have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 over their entire Concordia record. Many programs in Arts and Science are subject to quotas or limited enrolment. A higher cumulative GPA may be required for admission to certain programs (for example, the minimum requirements for transfer to Economics is a cumulative GPA of 2.60 and 24 credits completed at Concordia. The minimum requirements for transfer to Psychology or Exercise Science, Exercise Science: Clinical Exercise Physiology or Athletic Therapy, are a cumulative GPA of 3.00 and 24 credits completed at Concordia). \n Moreover, some programs have additional requirements, e.g. interview, letter of intent, portfolio. For the following programs, students should contact the appropriate department for selection criteria for internal transfer as early as possible: Actuarial Math/Finance, Communication Studies, Community Service, Community, Public Affairs and Policy Studies, Creative Writing, Early Childhood and Elementary Education, Family Life Education, Human Relations, Individually Structured Program, Journalism, Leisure Sciences, Modern Arabic Language and Culture, Modern Chinese Language (Mandarin) and Culture, Pastoral Caregiving, TESL, Therapeutic Recreation, Specialization in Traduction, Western Society and Culture. \n                    Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science\r\n Applicants must have completed a minimum of 12 applicable credits at Concordia prior to being considered for a degree transfer. Applicants seeking transfer to competitive Engineering programs should have completed a number of the required prerequisites with above average grades prior to applying for transfer. \n In general, students applying to any of the Engineering and Computer Science programs should have a minimum GPA in the 2.50 range to be considered for transfer. All programs in the Faculty are competitive; therefore, meeting the minimum cumulative/annual GPA requirement does not guarantee entry into competitive programs. Grades obtained in prerequisite courses and core program courses will carry significant weight in this decision. \n For the Winter Term (January entry), applicants must have already  completed a minimum of 12 credits . Courses in progress will not be factored into any January entry decision; therefore, students admitted to the University in the previous September are not eligible for a degree transfer into the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. \n                    Faculty of Fine Arts\r\n Entry is selective and competitive and in most areas is based on a portfolio and/or interview and/or audition. As there is a quota for each program in the Faculty of Fine Arts, it is not possible to indicate a grade requirement. The final selection will be influenced by the number of available places and the number and quality of applicants. \n Deadline dates for the submission of portfolios or to arrange interviews and/or auditions vary by department. For specific information on portfolio/interview/audition requirements and deadline dates, applicants should  consult the specific department  in the Faculty of Fine Arts. \n                    John Molson School of Business\r\n Applicants for transfer to either the BComm or BAdmin program must meet the following requirements: \n Complete a minimum of 12 credits at Concordia University and achieve a  minimum  Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.70. (The CGPA is an overall GPA based on the grades for all the courses completed at Concordia). \n Complete the following five courses (or their equivalents) prior to admission: \n BTM 200  \u2013 Fundamentals of Information Technology. (Students who completed either INTE 290 or DESC 200 are not required to complete this course.) \n ECON 201  \u2013 Introduction to Microeconomics \n ECON 203  \u2013 Introduction to Macroeconomics \n MATH 208  \u2013 Fundamentals of Mathematics I (Linear Algebra) \n MATH 209  \u2013 Fundamentals of Mathematics II (Calculus I) \n \u00a0 \n Achieve an average grade of 2.70 (B-) or better in MATH 208 and MATH 209. Students who have received an exemption for MATH 208 must achieve a minimum grade of 2.70 in MATH 209, and vice versa. \n Applicants who have been placed in Failed Standing in their program at Concordia will not be considered for transfer to JMSB programs. \n Such students must first apply for readmission to their current program, upgrade their academic standing by completing 24 to 30 credits, achieving a minimum CGPA of 2.70 for the courses completed after readmission to their program, and meeting requirements 2 and 3 above. Transfer credits for courses completed prior to re-admission will not be awarded. \n . \n Connect with us \n /CUFutureStudents\r\n @CUFutureStudent\r\n CUFutureStudent\r\n Helpful resources \n Viewbook \n Undergraduate Admissions Guide \n Undergraduate Program Guide \n Undergraduate Course Calendar \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
