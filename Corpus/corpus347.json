If you can't access your BIOS, your best course of action is to take the computer into a tech department instead of doing it yourself. \n 10 Second Summary Edit \n 1. Restart your computer. \n2. Press your computer's  BIOS key . \n3. Select the  \"Setup Defaults\" option . \n4. Press  \u21b5  Enter . \n Steps Edit \n Method One of Three: Resetting from Within BIOS Edit \n 1 \n Restart your computer.  Open Start\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/0\\/07\\/Windowsstart.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/0\\/07\\/Windowsstart.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":460,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":760} \n, click the power icon\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/5\\/5d\\/Windowspower.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/5\\/5d\\/Windowspower.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":460,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":760} \n, and click  Restart .\n If your computer is locked, click the lock screen, then click the power icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen and click  Restart . \n If your computer is already off, press your computer's \"On\" switch. \n 2 \n Wait for the computer's first startup screen to appear.  Once the startup screen appears, you'll have a very limited window in which you can press the setup key.\n It's best to start pressing the setup key as soon as the computer begins to restart. \n If you see \"Press [key] to enter setup\" or something similar flash across the bottom of the screen and then disappear, you'll need to restart and try again. \n 3 \n Repeatedly tap  Del  or  F2  to enter setup.  The key you're prompted to press might also be different; if so, use that key instead.\n If  Del  or  F2  don't work, try  F8   F10   Esc  or  Tab  \u21b9 . \n You'll typically use the \"F\" keys to access the BIOS. These are at the top of your keyboard, though you may have to locate and hold the  Fn  key while pressing the proper \"F\" key. \n You can look at your computer model's manual or online support page to confirm your computer's BIOS key. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e4\\/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e4\\/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Wait for your BIOS to load.  After successfully hitting the setup key, the BIOS will load. This should only take a few moments. When the loading is complete, you will be taken to the BIOS settings menu.\n If you cannot access your BIOS because you are locked out with a password or it has been corrupted, use one of the other methods in this article. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bb\\/40069-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-40069-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bb\\/40069-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-40069-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 5 \n Find the \"Setup Defaults\" option.  The location and wording of this option varies for every different BIOS, but it will typically be called \"Reset to Default\", \"Factory Default\", \"Setup Defaults\", or something similar. It may be located in one of the tabs or it may be an option listed near the navigation buttons.\n If your BIOS does not have this option, use one of the following methods following this section. \n 6 \n Select the \"Load Setup Defaults\" option and press  \u21b5  Enter .  Use the arrow keys to select it; pressing  \u21b5  Enter  will usually begin resetting your BIOS immediately.\n Again, the wording of the option you select will likely differ for each BIOS. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/38\\/40069-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-40069-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/38\\/40069-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-40069-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 7 \n Save your changes and confirm your selection if necessary.  This will often be combined with the process of exiting a BIOS. Your computer will automatically reboot. If you need to change your BIOS settings once your BIOS resets, you may need to reboot your computer again and enter the BIOS to change them.\n Advertisement \n Method Two of Three: Removing the CMOS Battery Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e1\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e1\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 1 \n Power down your computer.  Either use the Start menu to shut down, or press and hold your computer's power button until the computer shuts down.\n If you're using a desktop computer, you can usually turn the CPU entirely off by pressing a switch on the back of the CPU box. \n 2 \n Unplug your computer from any power sources.  This includes power cables for desktop computers and charging cables for laptops. \n 3 \n Remove your computer's battery if necessary.  If you're using a laptop (or a desktop with a backup battery), remove the battery before continuing. \n 4 \n Discharge any static electricity  before continuing.  Touch a nonpainted metal surface to get rid of any static electricity before you start taking apart your computer. Touching the motherboard or other internal computer components while not properly grounded can permanently damage your computer. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1d\\/40069-13.jpg\\/v4-460px-40069-13.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1d\\/40069-13.jpg\\/v4-760px-40069-13.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 5 \n Open your case.  You will need to be able to access the motherboard of your computer. Be very careful when working on the inside of your computer, as electrostatic discharge can easily destroy sensitive components.\n For many laptops, you can access the CMOS battery from a removable panel on the bottom of the laptop. If there is no panel available, you will most likely need to disassemble the laptop to access it. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c0\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-18.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-18.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c0\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-18.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-18.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 6 \n Remove the CMOS battery.  The battery is typically located near your PCI slots, but may be in different locations depending on the manufacturer of your motherboard. It may be hidden by expansion cards and cables. The battery is usually a standard 3V, round, flat watch battery (CR2032).\n The CMOS battery isn't always removable. If the battery won't budge, don't force it; instead, try  resetting your motherboard's jumper . \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e9\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-21.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-21.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e9\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-21.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-21.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 7 \n Press your power button.  Press and hold the power button on your computer for about 10-15 seconds to discharge any remaining power stored in the capacitors. By discharging the power, the CMOS memory will reset, thereby resetting your BIOS.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/53\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-19.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-19.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/53\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-19.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-19.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 8 \n Reinsert the CMOS battery.  Carefully reinsert the CMOS battery back into its housing. Make sure that you have put the battery in the right direction. The slightly smaller side should be facing down.\n 9 \n Reassemble your computer.  Do so carefully, and remember to ground yourself periodically. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-20.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-20.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-20.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-20.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 10 \n Reconnect your computer's power source(s).  If you unplugged the computer from the wall and/or removed the battery, plug it back in and/or replace the battery.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/33\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-10.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-10.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/33\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-10.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-10.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 11 \n Turn back on your computer.  Depending on your computer, you may have to access the BIOS and reconfigure some of the options, including the default boot option or the date and time.\n Advertisement \n Method Three of Three: Resetting the Jumper Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e1\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e1\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 1 \n Power down your computer.

Locate the three-pin jumper on your motherboard that controls the BIOS. It will usually found near the CMOS battery. The jumper will be covering two of the three pins.\n The jumper may be labeled CLEAR, CLR, CLEAR CMOS, PSSWRD, or a variety of other labels. Refer to your motherboard's documentation to find the correct jumper. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2e\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2e\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 7 \n Move the jumper to the other two pins.  For example, if the jumper is covering the first and second pins, move it so that it is covering the second and third pins. Be sure to pull the jumper straight up to remove it so that you don't bend the pins.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/dc\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-459px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/dc\\/Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-759px-Reset-Your-BIOS-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306.45604395604,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868} \n 8 \n Press your power button.
