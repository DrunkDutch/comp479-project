[1] [2]  The term has not been widely adopted by  sexologists , who instead use terms that refer to the specific age range in question. An arguable historical precursor was  Richard von Krafft-Ebing 's concept of \"age fetishism\". [3] \n Sexual preferences based on age [ edit ] \n Pedohebephilia  refers to an expansion and reclassification of pedophilia and hebephilia with subgroups, proposed during the development of the  DSM-5 . [4]  It refers more broadly to sexual attractions. Under the proposed revisions, people who are dysfunctional as a result of it would be diagnosed with pedohebephilic disorder. People would be broken down into types based on the idea of being attracted to one, the other or both of the subgroups. The proposed revision was not ratified for inclusion in the final published version of DSM-5.\n Infantophilia  (sometimes called  nepiophilia ) is a subtype of pedophilia describing a sexual preference for  toddlers  and  infants  (less than 5 years old). [5] \n Pedophilia  is a  psychological disorder  in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a sexual preference for prepubescent children. [6] [7]  According to the fifth edition of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM-5), pedophilia is a  paraphilia  in which a person has intense sexual urges towards children, and experiences recurrent sexual urges towards and  fantasies  about children. Pedophilic disorder is further defined as psychological disorder in which a person meets the criteria for pedophilia above, and also either acts upon those urges, or else experiences distress or interpersonal difficulty as a consequence. [8] [9]  The diagnosis can be made under the DSM or  ICD  criteria for persons age 16 and older. [10]   Child sexual abuse  is not committed by all pedophiles, and not all child molesters are pedophiles. [11] \n Attraction to adolescents\n Hebephilia  and  ephebophilia  are sexual preferences for pubescent and post-pubescent youths, respectively. [12]  The term  hebephilia  was introduced by Glueck (1955). [13] \n Attraction to adults\n Teleiophilia  (from Greek  t\u00e9leios , \"full grown\") is a sexual preference for adults. [14]  The term was coined by  Ray Blanchard  in 2000. [15] \n Mesophilia  (derived from the Greek \"mesos\", \"intermediate\") is a sexual preference for middle-aged adults. The term was coined by  Michael Seto  in 2016. [16] \n Gerontophilia  is a sexual preference for the elderly.
