The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.0. Applicability Applies when scripting is used to open new windows.  This failure relates to: \n\t\t\t\tSuccess Criterion 3.2.1 (On Focus) \n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Meet 3.2.1 (On Focus)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderstanding Success Criterion 3.2.1 (On Focus)\n\t\t\t\tSuccess Criterion 3.2.5 (Change on Request) \n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Meet 3.2.5 (Change on Request)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderstanding Success Criterion 3.2.5 (Change on Request)\n\t\t\t\t\t Description  Some Web sites open a new window when a page is loaded, to advertise a\n                        product or service. The objective of this technique is to ensure that pages\n                        do not disorient users by opening up one or more new windows that automatically attain focus as soon as a\n                        page is loaded.  Examples Note:  There are multiple methods by which this failure may be triggered. Two\n                            common examples that are supported differently in various versions of\n                            user agents are listed as examples below.  \n\t\t\t\t\tFailure Example 1:  The following example is commonly used in HTML 4.01 to open new\n                                windows when pages are loaded. Example Code: \nwindow.onload = showAdvertisement;\n function showAdvertisement()\n {\n  window.open('advert.html', '_blank', 'height=200,width=150');\n } \n\t\t\t\t\tFailure Example 2:  The following example commonly used in XHTML to open new windows when\n                                pages are loaded. Example Code: \nif (window.addEventListener) { \n    window.addEventListener(\"load\", showAdvertisement, true);\n}\nif (window.attachEvent) {\n    window.attachEvent(\"onload\", showAdvertisement);\n}\nfunction showAdvertisement()\n{\nwindow.open('noscript.html', '_blank', 'height=200,width=150');\n} Resources Resources are for information purposes only, no endorsement implied.
