This policy outlines the information we collect from you \u2014 and what we do with it. \n Canonical collects personal information from you in a number of different ways. For example, when you download one of our products, receive services from us or use one of our websites (including  www.canonical.com         and  www.ubuntu.com ). \n At Canonical, we consider your privacy to be extremely important to us. These are the fundamental principles that we follow in relation to your personal information: \n We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. \n We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to provide you with services, products, to comply with the law, or to protect our rights. \n We don\u2019t store personal information unless required for the on-going operation of services to you, to provide you with products, to comply with law or to protect our rights. \n We will use personal information that you provide to us in accordance with this privacy policy. \n Older versions \n 25 March 2013\u00a0\u203a \n What we collect \n We may collect the following types of personal information from you: \n Websites \n When you register to use certain parts of our websites, such as wikis or message boards, or register for free accounts, we may ask for personal information such as your full name, email address and a password. \n Chat rooms, forums and newsgroups \n These are available to our community. Any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and may be recorded, archived and republished by anyone. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information\n        in such areas. \n Canonical products \n When you register for services or purchase any product from Canonical, we may ask for information such as your email address, billing address, and credit card information. Credit card information is only used in processing your transaction. Please\n        note that we may use a third party payment processing merchant to process your payments. \n Non-personally identifying information \n Canonical may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor\u2019s request. Our purpose in collecting\n        non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites and services. For further information about how we use cookies, see the \u201ccookie\u201d section below. \n Error reports \n When you chose to send an error report, it includes a unique identifier for your computer. This identifier does not identify you, unless you (or someone acting on your behalf) discloses it separately. An error report may include personal information\n        such as the state of programs that were running at the time. You can block future error reports from the privacy panel of System Settings. \n Ubuntu online accounts \n When you use Ubuntu online accounts, your personal information is stored on your PC and it can be accessed by some applications.  View the legal notice explaining how we use this personal information. \n General \n If you contact us and provide us with information, we may keep a record of that correspondence and information \n Searching in the dash \n When you enter a search term into the dash Ubuntu will search your Ubuntu computer and will record the search terms locally. Depending on whether you have opted in or out (see the \u201cOnline Search\u201d section below), we may also send your\n        keystrokes as a search term to productsearch.ubuntu.com and selected third parties so that we may complement your search results with online search results from such third parties including: Facebook, Twitter, BBC and Amazon. Canonical and these\n        selected third parties will collect your search terms and use them to provide you with search results while using Ubuntu. \n By searching in the dash you consent to: \n the collection and use of your search terms and IP address in this way; and \n the storage of your search terms and IP address by Canonical and such selected third parties (if applicable). \n Canonical will only use your search terms and IP address in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For information on how our selected third parties may use your information, please see their privacy policies. \n You may restrict your dash so that we don\u2019t send searches to third parties and you don\u2019t receive online search results. To do this go to the Privacy panel and toggle the \u2019Include online search results\u2019 option. The Privacy\n        panel can be found in your System Settings or via a dash search.  For a current list of our selected third parties, please see the third party privacy policies. \n What do we do with the information we collect? \n We may use your information in the following ways: \n To authenticate access to certain features of our websites. \n To contact you to respond to enquiries or to provide notices to you regarding your use of our websites or the provision of our services. \n To provide services, products, process payment, and authenticate access (where required). \n To analyse the performance or the appropriateness of products or services. \n To comply with legal and regulatory requirements (including responding to court orders, subpoenas and to prevent crime). These special circumstances may require us to disclose personal information. \n To contact you if your actions violate your agreement with us (if any). \n To fix errors and analyse trends. \n To study how anonymous users interact with our websites and services. \n To market our products or services to you. \n Unless you have notified us otherwise, Canonical may occasionally send you email to tell you about new features, solicit feedback, or just to keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on.

If it is necessary to transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area we will make every effort to ensure that the person to whom we pass the personal information agrees to treat\n        it with the same level of protection as we do. \n If we are sold or merge with another business entity your personal information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners. \n Unless required by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any personal information you provide to us without your consent. \n Cookies \n We use persistent cookies to support a smooth user experience.
