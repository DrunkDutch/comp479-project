The Burrow was used as the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters, due to the compromised Fidelius Charm placed on 12 Grimmauld Place, in  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  until it lost its given protection. The Weasley house has seven floors. It is also quite dilapidated, managing to remain standing only by  magic . Despite the house's rundown appearance,  Harry  remarks on his first visit that it was the best house he had ever been in and it becomes his second favourite place in the world (after Hogwarts). The well-hidden orchard nearby doubles as a  Quidditch  pitch for the Weasley boys and  Ginny Weasley . A multitude of garden gnomes infests the garden of the Burrow. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the Burrow was described as a pig-sty that had extra rooms added to it. When a new child was born, Molly and Arthur Weasley just added an extra room onto the house. Outside the front door, were a jumble of wellington boots and a rusty old cauldron. \n Godric's Hollow [ edit ] \n Leavesden Studios  film set for Potter's cottage in Godric's Hollow \n Godric's Hollow  is a fictional village located in the  West Country  of England. [1] [2]  It is noted for being home to a magical community like several other villages such as Ottery St\u00a0Catchpole and Tinworth. [3]  The village was the home and final hiding place of  James  and  Lily Potter  before being murdered by  Lord Voldemort . [4]  It was at this time that their baby son,  Harry , was left with his lightning bolt-shaped scar. \n Godric's Hollow was the home of James Potter's family, and the home of long-dead Hogwarts founder  Godric Gryffindor [3]  (after whom the village was named). After expressing his interest in returning to Godric's Hollow to visit his parents' graves, Harry does so in the company of  Hermione Granger . Once there, it is revealed in  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  that the church graveyard of Godric's Hollow is the resting place for many wizard personalities, including a member of Hannah Abbott's family, but the most famous being  Ignotus Peverell  and the Potters. Dumbledore's mother Kendra moved her family to Godric's Hollow after her husband, Percival, was arrested for attacking three Muggle boys. \n Other notable residents of the village include Bowman Wright (inventor of the  Golden Snitch ) [5]  and  Bathilda Bagshot , author of  A History of Magic . \n Rowling was questioned in an interview for BBC  Newsround  and implicitly confirmed the connection between Godric's Hollow and Godric Gryffindor. [6]  This connection was also stated outright by Hermione in the final book of the series. \n At the centre of the village square of Godric's Hollow, is a war memorial that magically transforms into a monument to the Potter family \u2013 James, Lily, and Harry \u2013 when approached by witches and/or wizards unaccompanied by Muggles. Invisible to Muggles, the remains of Harry's old house (left just as it was after Voldemort attacked) are found at the end of the main street. \n Little Hangleton [ edit ] \n Little Hangleton  is a fictional Muggle village notable as the place of origin of Voldemort's maternal and paternal ancestors, and as the place where he was restored to bodily form in  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . Although the village first appears in  Goblet of Fire , the fourth volume in the series, it is not described until  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , the sixth volume. \n The village occupies the floor of a valley, bounded by steep hills, not far from the larger settlement of Great Hangleton. Above the village on one side of the valley are a church, a cemetery and the Riddle House, the former estate of the aristocratic  Riddle family  and at one time the finest house in the village. It first appears in the opening of  Goblet of Fire  as the location of  Frank Bryce 's murder; and at this point in the chronology of the  Harry Potter  series, it is decrepit and covered in vines. It is believed to be held by a \"rich man\" for tax purposes, although this is in reality to keep it from being sold or torn down. \n During his time as a student,  Tom Marvolo Riddle  murdered his father and grandparents in the house. \n On the opposite side of the valley, the only dwelling appears to have been the dilapidated cottage which was the home of the  Pure-blooded , anti-social descendants of  Salazar Slytherin , the  Gaunt family . The Gaunt cottage is set in a copse alongside a winding road which climbed out of the valley. [7]  In  Goblet of Fire , Voldemort and Harry fight in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. \n Little Whinging [ edit ] \nNo 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging \nUnder the stairs, No 4 Privet Drive \n Little Whinging  is a fictitious town in  Surrey , England, located to the south of London.  Alison Lurie  noted in the  New York Review of Books  that Little Whinging's name is \"a joke that American readers may not get: we would call the place Little Whining\". [8] \n Number 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, is the  Dursleys'  home, in which Harry lives with his aunt  Petunia , uncle  Vernon , and cousin  Dudley . He has lived there since the age of fifteen months, having previously lived with his parents in Godric's Hollow; however, since he began attending Hogwarts, he spends little time there, though he reluctantly returns during the summer holidays. Number 4 is known to have four bedrooms upstairs, at least one bathroom, a kitchen, a sitting room and a conservatory downstairs (apart from the cupboard under the stairs). \n The name of the street refers to the hedges that enclose many suburban gardens, as Rowling liked the idea of enclosure. In the novels and films, the Dursleys' home is in a respectable and boring neighbourhood where the neighbours ostracise Harry, who despises Little Whinging because of his memories of his cruel treatment there.  Arabella Figg , who lives two streets away from 4\u00a0Privet Drive in the novels (but just across the road in the films) knows of Harry's magic, because she is a  Squib  member of the  Order of the Phoenix , placed in Little Whinging by  Dumbledore  to keep an eye on Harry. In  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , Dumbledore reveals that the reason Harry must return there at least once a year is because of the protection Harry's mother left upon him when she gave her life to save him. That act allowed an \"ancient magic\" to work, which meant Harry could never be harmed so long as he lived in the care of his mother's blood; in this case, his Aunt Petunia. This charm would not break until Harry turned 17. \n Other mentioned places in Little Whinging are Magnolia Crescent somewhat around the corner and a playground at a bit of a distance to Privet Drive which before Harry's fifth year has been partially demolished by Dudley and his gang. \n According to the documentary  Creating the World of Harry Potter Part I: The Magic Begins , included in the 2009 DVD/Blu-ray \"Ultimate Edition\" of  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , the film-makers initially attempted to film the Little Whinging/Privet Drive sequences on location in a real urban area. When this proved unfeasible, a section of Privet Drive was constructed on the backlot at  Leavesden Film Studios . As of November 2016 [update]  this standing set, which remained in use throughout the decade-long filming history of the Harry Potter films, remains visible in  Google Maps  aerial views of the studio. [9] [ non-primary source needed ]  It sits in a location with other  Harry Potter  sets and props. [ citation needed ] \n Malfoy Manor [ edit ] \n Malfoy  Manor  is the home of the aristocratic Malfoy family:  Lucius ,  Narcissa , their son  Draco Malfoy  and later  Bellatrix Lestrange  (sister of Narcissa). It is mentioned in the fifth book that the manor is located somewhere in  Wiltshire , England. The Malfoys were previously served by  Dobby the house elf , before Lucius was tricked by Harry into freeing him. [HP2] \n In the  Chamber of Secrets , Draco reveals that the manor has its own \"chamber of secrets\" under the drawing room, which was used to hide valuable dark artefacts when the Ministry raided the manor. Voldemort used Malfoy Manor as headquarters on at least one occasion in  Deathly Hallows . The three Malfoys seemed quite displeased by this use of their manor as Voldemort himself noted; only Bellatrix appears to be pleased he is there. The Malfoys have become prisoners in their own home and in very real fear for their lives. During the  Deathly Hallows , several prisoners are being kept in the basement on Voldemort's orders, including  Luna Lovegood ,  Dean Thomas ,  Griphook  the Goblin, and  Mr. Ollivander . When Snatchers capture  Harry ,  Ron , and Hermione, they are brought to Malfoy Manor. They escape with the other prisoners thanks to Dobby's help. The four residents of the manor are then placed under house arrest by Lord Voldemort, until they join with other  Death Eaters  in the Battle of Hogwarts. \n Malfoy Manor was inspired by and partly shot at  Hardwick Hall , Derbyshire \u2013 a National Trust property. \n Number 12, Grimmauld Place [ edit ] \n Number 12, Grimmauld Place  (a pun on \"grim old place\"), London is the address and name of reference to the home of the Black family, an ancient and  pure-blooded  line of wizards. It first appears in the fifth book. The structure of Number\u00a012 Grimmauld Place is a  Georgian  terraced house. \n Number 12 houses the  Black family  tree on a wall tapestry, and an enchanted  portrait  of  Walburga Black , Sirius' mother. An ancient and deeply mad  house-elf  named  Kreacher  is loyal to the portrait of Mrs. Black. There are other portraits of members of the Black family, including  Phineas Nigellus Black , one-time Head of the Black family and least-popular Headmaster of Hogwarts. The staircase is lined with the heads of beheaded former house-elves, which are mounted onto the walls. \n Many security measures are in place at Grimmauld Place: there are anti- Apparation  charms, the place is Unplottable, the whole house is under a Fidelius charm and it is disguised from  Muggles  and other interlopers. In the seventh book, it is noted that the neighbours had long ago come to terms with the houses on their square running straight from 11 to 13. It is as secure as any magical dwelling can be and can accommodate a large number of people. For this reason, it was chosen as the headquarters of the reconstituted  Order of the Phoenix  when Sirius offered it to the Order. Only magical people can see it, and only if told the location by the Secret Keeper himself. The house is even immune from the ' Taboo ' imposed by the  Ministry of Magic  after the coup d'\u00e9tat. This is known because  Hermione Granger  mentions  Voldemort  by name at least once whilst inside the house. [10] \n Because Sirius was incarcerated in  Azkaban , the house fell into disrepair over the next several years. When he later returned to his family home in the fifth book, it was a gloomy and unpleasant dwelling teeming with dust, decay, magical creatures, and various dangers. Harry inherits the house at the beginning of  Half-Blood Prince  after Sirius's death, although he donates it to the Order (wanting no connection to the place where Sirius felt trapped and useless before his death). \n In  Deathly Hallows , it becomes a sanctuary for Harry, Ron, and Hermione while hiding from Voldemort. Harry loses the house to Voldemort when  Corban Yaxley  grabs hold of Hermione when she attempts to escape by Disapparition. She drops Yaxley off at 12 Grimmauld Place, thus revealing the location to Voldemort. \n The  Claremont Square  area of London was used for the exteriors of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. \n Shell Cottage [ edit ] \nShell Cottage in  Deathly Hallows \n Shell Cottage  is the home of  Bill Weasley  and  Fleur Delacour  after they get married in  Deathly Hallows . It is located overlooking a beach outside the village of Tinworth in Cornwall. [11]  The cottage served as a hiding place for Harry,  Ron ,  Hermione , Luna,  Dean Thomas ,  Mr. Ollivander  and  Griphook  after they managed to escape from imprisonment in Malfoy Manor.  Dobby  the house-elf was buried in the garden after he died. During the war, Bill himself was the Secret-Keeper for Bill and Fleur. \n The Shell Cottage Scenes were filmed on Pembrokeshire beaches. [ citation needed ] \n Spinner's End [ edit ] \n Spinner's End  is a Muggle street, on which sits a house that is the home of  Severus Snape . [12]  It is described as one of several streets of identical brick houses. The street is located near a dirty river, the bank of which is strewn with litter. A mill with a tall chimney is close by. From the description of its surroundings it is likely that this is the house Severus Snape grew up in, thus making the place the fictitious town of Cokeworth. \n Snape's front door opens directly into a sitting room that has the feeling of a dark, padded cell, containing walls filled with books, [13]  threadbare furniture, and a dim, candle-filled lamp that hangs from the ceiling. A hidden door leads to a narrow staircase. Spinner's End first appears in  Half-Blood Prince , when Snape is visited by  Bellatrix Lestrange  and  Narcissa Malfoy . In  Deathly Hallows , it is revealed that Snape lived at Spinner's End as a young child and that  Lily Potter  and  Petunia Dursley  lived in the same town. \n Schools [ edit ] \n Beauxbatons [ edit ] \nCoat of arms for the magic school Beauxbatons, as described in the Harry Potter books: \"Two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars\". \n The  Beauxbatons Academy of Magic  (French:  Acad\u00e9mie de Magie Beauxb\u00e2tons ) is a magic school first introduced in  Goblet of Fire . Beauxbatons has a history that goes back at least 700\u00a0years, when it first began participating in the  Triwizard Tournament . \n The Academy is housed in a glittering palace in France. The food, at least according to Fleur, is delicious. Students wear blue and grey silk uniforms. Rather than suits of armour, statues of ice that glitter like diamonds during the Christmas season flank the halls of Beauxbatons. While only female students of Beauxbatons are portrayed in the film, the books imply that the school is  co-ed  since Hogwarts students  Parvati  and  Padma Patil  are asked to dance by two Beauxbatons boys at the Yule Ball. \n Goblet of Fire  states that Beauxbatons Academy owns a large carriage the size of a house flown by horses whose hooves are as big as dinner plates; it can accommodate a large party of students and their half-giant (according to  Hagrid ) headmistress. The carriage is pale blue and has the Beauxbatons coat of arms on it (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars). \n The phrase  beaux b\u00e2tons  means \"beautiful wands\" in French. [14] [15] [16] \n Castelobruxo [ edit ] \n The wizarding school for the South American continent, Castelobruxo, is the Brazilian wizarding school located amid the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil. It takes students from all over South America. The school is located deep within the Amazon rainforest. Described as a fabulous castle, the building is an imposing square edifice of golden rock, often compared to a temple. Both building and grounds are protected by the  Caipora . At one point, Bill was penpals with a student at Castelobruxo, but their relationship deteriorated after Bill was given a cursed hat. \n Durmstrang [ edit ] \n The  Durmstrang Institute for Magical Learning  ( German :  Durmstrang-Institut f\u00fcr Zauberei ) is a magic school that also makes its first appearance in  Goblet of Fire . The school has existed for at least 700 years, when they began participating in the  Triwizard Tournament . Dumbledore welcomes Durmstrang's students as \"our friends from the North\". Durmstrang students wear heavy furs with blood-red robes. The students of Durmstrang mentioned by name are  Russians  and  Bulgarians . Durmstrang is portrayed as an all-boys school in the film, but according to the book, it is co-ed. Several female students are mentioned, though not by name. \n Durmstrang is known for placing an emphasis on the study of the  Dark Arts . While other schools of magic in the series limit the study to  Defence Against the Dark Arts , Durmstrang students actually learn them. In  Deathly Hallows , it is revealed that the Dark wizard  Gellert Grindelwald  attended Durmstrang. He also carved the symbol of the  Deathly Hallows  onto the school's stone walls. Although Durmstrang teaches the Dark Arts as part of its curriculum, apparently the experiments performed by Grindelwald were considered too extreme even by the school's standards as he was expelled because of them. \n The name \"Durmstrang\" is likely to be an allusion to the German phrase  Sturm und Drang  meaning  storm and stress . [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] \n Hogwarts [ edit ] \n Main article:  Hogwarts \n Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , shortened  Hogwarts , is a fictional British school of  magic  for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in  J.K. Rowling 's  Harry Potter  series. [22] [23] \n Ilvermorny [ edit ] \nCoat of Arms of Ilvermorny \n Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , shortened  Ilvermorny , is a fictional American school of magic, which serves as the school for the North American continent. [24]  It first appeared in a short story by J.K. Rowling on Pottermore on June 28, 2016, and its first onscreen mention was in  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . The school was founded in the seventeenth century in  Adams, Massachusetts , on  Mount Greylock , the highest natural point in the state. [25]  It is concealed from the non-magic world by enchantments which may sometimes appear as a cloud surrounding the peak. [26]  Modeled after  Hogwarts , the school has four Houses into which the students are sorted upon arrival. [24] \n Ilvermorny was founded by Isolt Sayre after she travelled from Ireland via England to North America on the  Mayflower  in 1620 and named after the cottage in which she had been born. She had not had the opportunity to attend Hogwarts during her childhood, and partially modelled Ilvermorny after what she had heard of Hogwarts, as well as her own imagination. Her first students were her own adopted children, Chadwick Boot and Webster Boot. [24] \n Ilvermorny is divided into four houses;  Thunderbird ,  Horned Serpent ,  Pukwudgie , and  Wampus , each said to represent a different part of the ideal wizard. The names were chosen by Isolt Sayre and her family after their favourite magical creatures. Chadwick being \"intelligent but also temperamental\" [24]  chose the Thunderbird, his brother Webster \"argumentative and fiercely loyal\" chose the Wampus. Isolt herself was a  Parselmouth  and chose the Horned Serpent, and her  No-Maj  (Muggle or non-magical) husband James Steward picked the Pukwudgie, since Isolt's stories about one made him laugh. Ilvermorny has no house colours, but every student wears blue and cranberry robes, fastened by a gold  Gordian Knot . [24] \n The Sorting process is also different to that of Hogwarts. While the rest of the school watches from the circular balcony overhead, new students file into the round entrance hall. They stand around the walls and, one by one, are called to stand on the symbol of the Gordian Knot set into the middle of the stone floor. In silence the school then waits for the enchanted carvings to react. If the Horned Serpent wants the student, the crystal set into its forehead will light up. If the Wampus wants the student, it roars. The Thunderbird signifies its approval by beating its wings, and the Pukwudgie will raise its arrow into the air. Unlike Hogwarts, more than one Ilvermorny house can claim a student; when two or more carvings react, the student is entitled to choose his or her house. [24] \n Mahoutokoro [ edit ] \n The smallest student body of all wizarding schools, Mahoutokoro is located on the volcanic island of Minami Iwo Jima, Japan. The island is surrounded by stormy seas, and has no Muggle inhabitants, although it is very close to a  Japanese Air Force  base. The hoops of the school's Quidditch pitch rise out from the ocean floor. Because students and staff have to deal with proximity to Japanese military aircraft, the Japanese Quidditch team is considered one of the most formidable teams in the world. The castle, or \"shiro\" stands at the peak of the extinct volcano and is constructed of pure white jade. Students start their education wearing a long, pale pink kimono whose colour changes in relation to their performance, culminating in bright gold for a graduate with outstanding grades. A student's kimono can turn white for two serious violations: turning to the Dark Arts (as they are known in Europe) and violating the international statute of secrecy. \"Turning white\" is considered a great dishonour, and students who do so are frequently expelled from the school and/or disowned by their families. [ citation needed ] \n Uagadou [ edit ] \n Uagadou is the Ugandan wizarding school, located atop the Mountains of the Moon in western  Uganda . It takes students from all over Africa, and is the largest of the eleven wizarding schools. Visitors spoke of a stunning edifice carved out of the mountainside and shrouded in mist, so that it sometimes appeared simply to float in mid-air. Unlike all other wizarding schools, Uagadou students do not utilize wands, learning spells through hand gestures. They also specialize in self-transfiguration, leaving many international wizards threatened by the sheer talent that many of Uagadou's students showcase. Uagadou is the only wizard school to send their invitations through dream messengers. \n Diagon Alley [ edit ] \n Diagon Alley \n Harry Potter  location \n Type \n Shopping street/shopping centre in London \n First appearance \n Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone \nScribbulus shop, Diagon Alley \n Diagon Alley  is a fictional  high street  located in London. It is accessible to the  wizarding world , to which it is something of an economic hub, but hidden from Muggles (non-magical people). However, Muggles are allowed access to it if they need to accompany their  Muggle-born  magical children. If a wizard or witch needs something, chances are that it can be found in Diagon Alley. \n One entrance to Diagon Alley can be reached on foot by passing through The Leaky Cauldron (a wizarding pub/inn). The inn, which is invisible to Muggles, lies in between a bookshop and a music shop. To enter Diagon Alley, one must go through The Leaky Cauldron to a rear courtyard and tap a brick in the wall, found by counting three up and two across, three times. In the film, the tapping of five bricks around a hole in the wall opens the doorway to Diagon Alley. Given the busy nature of the area, travelling to and from Diagon Alley is likely typically done by more magical means such as  Apparition  or by using the  Floo Network , which are both ways of wizarding transport. [27]  It contains shops that offer a wide range of magical supplies, as well as the goblin-run Gringotts Bank. \n The DVD of  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  includes a video \"guided tour\" of Diagon Alley, apparently shot on the original film sets. In the first film, the Leaky Cauldron's entrance was filmed in  Bull's Head Passage , near  Leadenhall Market . In the  sixth film , it was inserted into the actual Charing Cross Road, between a book store and a surveyors' storefront. \n The name Diagon Alley is a near  homophone  of the word \"diagonally\", which is used as a plot device when Harry mispronounces the phrase near the beginning of the  Chamber of Secrets  film. \n Eeylops Owl Emporium [ edit ] \nEeylop's Owl Emporium \n Eeylops Owl Emporium  sells owls and supplies such as owl treats and cages. Inside, it is dark and full of soft hooting, rustling, and the flickering of \"jewel-bright eyes.\" [PS\u00a0Ch.5] . It is here that  Rubeus Hagrid  purchased Harry's snowy owl,  Hedwig , as a birthday gift in  The Philosopher's Stone . \n Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour [ edit ] \n Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour , under the management of the owner Florean Fortescue (founder and shopkeeper), sold  ice cream  and other treats, which could be enjoyed at outdoor tables. [PA\u00a0Ch.4]  Harry spent pleasant hours there working on homework assignments before his third year at Hogwarts in  Prisoner of Azkaban . Mr\u00a0Fortescue himself helped him with his school essays and supplied him with free sundaes every half-hour. Nearing the end of the summer holidays, Harry meets Ron and Hermione there. [PA\u00a0Ch.4]  In  the Half-Blood Prince  the parlour is boarded up and Fortescue has gone missing. Rowling confirmed that Florean was murdered. [28] \n Flourish & Blotts [ edit ] \nThe window of Flourish & Blotts displaying copies of  Magical Me  by  Gilderoy Lockhart \n Flourish & Blotts  sells a great variety of magic books, including textbooks for Hogwarts courses and other books of general magical interest. In the back there is a corner devoted solely to divination, which includes a small table stacked with titles like  Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself against Shocks  and  Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul . Another small display contains the book  Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst is Coming [PA\u00a0Ch.4] . \n Usually, there is a display of gold-embossed spell books the size of paving slabs in the window, but in  Prisoner of Azkaban , the front window holds an iron cage filled with hundreds of copies of  The Monster Book of Monsters . To deal with the vicious books, set for the third year  Care of Magical Creatures  class by Hagrid, the harassed manager had to gear up with thick gloves and jab at them with a knobbly walking stick, as the books tended to rip each other apart. The manager says that he had thought he had seen the worst when they bought 200 copies of  The Invisible Book of Invisibility , which were promptly misplaced.  [PA\u00a0Ch.4] \n In  Chamber of Secrets , celebrity author  Gilderoy Lockhart  signs copies of his autobiography,  Magical Me , at the shop the day Harry buys his second year school books. The signing drew a huge crowd of fans (mostly middle-aged women). This is also where  Lucius Malfoy  slips  Tom Riddle's diary  into Ginny's battered old  Transfiguration  book, thus causing the start of the events in  Chamber of Secrets . [CS\u00a0Ch.4] \n Gambol and Japes [ edit ] \n Gambol and Japes  is a wizarding joke shop. It is briefly mentioned in  Chamber of Secrets , where Fred, George and Lee Jordan stock up on \"Dr\u00a0 Filibuster 's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks.\" \n Gringotts Wizarding Bank [ edit ] \nGringotts Wizarding Bank \n See also:  Money in Harry Potter \n Gringotts Wizarding Bank  is the only known bank of the  wizarding world  and it is operated primarily by  goblins . A snowy white building, near the intersection of Knockturn Alley and Diagon Alley, Gringotts towers over all neighbouring shops. Customers pass through a set of bronze doors and then silver ones before entering the lobby. The main floor is paved with marble and has long counters stretching along its length. Within, wizards and witches keep their money and other valuables in vaults that are protected by very complex and very strong security measures. The vaults extend for miles under London and are accessible through rough stone passageways navigated by magic carts that travel speedily along their tracks. [PS\u00a0Ch.5]  Gringotts also offers Muggle-Wizarding currency exchange. [CS\u00a0Ch.4] \n When Harry first visits Gringotts, he is told by Hagrid that one would have to be mad to try to rob Gringotts. [PS\u00a0Ch.5]  Goblins are extremely possessive and will protect their money and valuables at any cost, making them ideal guardians for the valuables of the wizarding world. In addition, according to Hagrid, apart from Hogwarts, Gringotts is considered \"the safest place in the world for anything you want to keep safe\". [29] \n There are a number of methods of opening the vaults. Most vaults, such as Harry's, use small golden keys. Higher-security vaults may have various enchantments or other measures upon the doors. For example, the door to Vault 713, [30]  which briefly contained the Philosopher's Stone, must be stroked by a certified Gringotts goblin, whereupon it melts away to allow access to the contents. If anyone other than a certified Gringotts goblin touches the door, that person will be sucked into the vault, which is only checked for trapped thieves about once every 10 years. Dragons guard the maximum-security vaults found in the lowest reaches of the bank, and a subterranean waterfall called the \"Thief's Downfall\" acts to overturn carts that pass through it and negate spells used by would-be robbers. \nFront of Gringotts Bank \n In  the Philosopher's Stone  Gringotts Vault 713 held a small parcel wrapped in paper, inside of which was the  Philosopher's Stone . Dumbledore sent Hagrid to retrieve it while he escorted Harry. [PS\u00a0Ch.5]  Later that same day,  Professor Quirrell  broke into the vault under orders from Voldemort. Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining the Philosopher's Stone, the break-in shocked the wizarding world because it was unheard of for Gringotts to be robbed. Griphook claims that the protection had been lessened due to the Vault being emptied. In  Deathly Hallows , Harry, Ron, and Hermione, aided by a reluctant Griphook, break into the vault of  Bellatrix Lestrange  where a  Horcrux  of Voldemort (Hufflepuff's Cup) is hidden. However, when they enter Bellatrix's vault, which is stocked with all manner of treasures, they discover that the treasure has had Gemino and Flagrante charms placed on it, which, respectively, cause any item to multiply rapidly and go red-hot whenever it is touched. The trio escape with the Horcrux by freeing a half-blind dragon that was part of the security for the vault, and clambering onto its back. \n While Gringotts is largely staffed by goblins, including  Griphook  and Ragnok, it is known that the bank has human employees, though not apparently for banking and accounting services. Bill worked as a curse-breaker for Gringotts in Egypt, retrieving artefacts from ancient Egyptian tombs and pyramids. [31]  Fleur took a part-time job with Gringotts after participating in the  Triwizard Tournament , apparently to improve her English skills, and Wizard guards are mentioned in  Deathly Hallows  during the break in. \n Knockturn Alley [ edit ] \n Knockturn Alley  (a play on the word \" nocturnally \") [32]  is a dark and seedy alleyway leading off from the more savoury Diagon Alley to which Muggles have no access. It is frequented largely by Dark Wizards. Many of the shops in Knockturn Alley are devoted to the  Dark Arts ; the best known of which is Borgin & Burkes, which sells sinister and dangerous objects. Harry lands in Knockturn Alley in the  Chamber of Secrets , when accidentally saying (in the movie version) \"Diagonally\" instead of  Diagon Alley  (the book does not indicate what he pronounced) while using  Floo Powder  to get to Diagon Alley. Here  Hagrid  finds him (and narrowly rescues him from a witch with mossy teeth who was holding a tray with fingernails in it), while looking for Flesh-eating Slug repellent, for the school's cabbage patch. From there he takes him back to Diagon Alley, where they find  Hermione Granger  who takes them to the  Weasleys . \n Borgin & Burkes [ edit ] \n Borgin and Burkes is an antique shop, which specializes in the Dark Arts, located in Knockturn Alley. The shop sells many dangerous and Dark artefacts such as a cursed opal necklace, a  Hand of Glory , and half of a vanishing cabinet set which was used by Draco Malfoy to infiltrate Hogwarts in  the Half-Blood Prince . Lord Voldemort worked at Borgin and Burkes briefly after he left  Hogwarts  during the mid-1940s. It is owned by Caractacus Burke and Mr. Borgin, though Mr. Borgin is the only owner to appear in the series. \n The Leaky Cauldron [ edit ] \nInterior of The Leaky Cauldron \n The Leaky Cauldron  is a dark, shabby pub and inn for wizards, located on the Muggle street of  Charing Cross Road  in London, offering food, drinks and rooms to rent. It was founded by  Daisy Dodderidge  (1467\u20131555) in 1500 \"to serve as a gateway between the non-wizarding world and Diagon Alley.\" The current barman and innkeeper is a wizard named Tom. \n On the main floor, the inn has a bar, several private parlour rooms, and a large dining room. On the upper floors, there are a number of rooms available for rent; Harry has stayed in Room 11, [PA\u00a0Ch.4]  which has a talking mirror and windows that allow him to look out onto Charing Cross Road. People often stay at The Leaky Cauldron when they come to London on shopping trips. \n The pub serves as a way of entering into Diagon Alley from the Muggle world for Muggle-borns and their parents (both of whom, until the first letter from Hogwarts, have no magical knowledge or means of entering). The rear of The Leaky Cauldron opens onto a chilly little courtyard, in which a particular brick must be tapped three times to open a path to Diagon Alley. \n Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions [ edit ] \n Madam Malkin's  is a clothing shop next to Flourish & Blotts. It sells robes and other clothing, including the standard Hogwarts-required plain black work robes, and dress robes. Inside the shop, Madam Malkin and her assistants will tailor the robes to fit.  Malkin  is an archaic term for a crotchety old woman. \n Harry has two meetings with Draco Malfoy in Madam Malkin's shop. This is where Harry meets the first wizard of his own age, Malfoy, for the first time, in  Philosopher's Stone . Harry is rather bewildered by the questions Malfoy asks, because Harry is still unfamiliar with many aspects of the wizarding world. A second meeting occurs just before the beginning of Harry's sixth year, in  Half-Blood Prince . This meeting is far more unpleasant, and escalates quickly into a near-duel before Malfoy and his mother leave in disgust. \n Magical Menagerie [ edit ] \n The  Magical Menagerie  is a magical creature shop that in addition to selling magical creatures offers advice on animal care and health. The shop is very cramped, noisy and smelly, due to every inch being covered with cages. Among the creatures in the Magical Menagerie are enormous purple toads, a firecrab, poisonous orange snails, a fat white rabbit that can turn into a silk top hat, cats of every colour, ravens, puffskeins, and a cage of sleek black rats that play skipping games with their tails. \n When Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit the shop in  Prisoner of Azkaban , a witch wearing heavy black spectacles helps them. Ron buys  Rat Tonic  for his pet rat,  Scabbers , while Hermione buys a cat,  Crookshanks . \n Ollivanders [ edit ] \nThe upper windows of Ollivanders \n Ollivanders  is a  wand  shop described as \"narrow and shabby, with a sign that reads  Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC  in peeling gold letters over the door. The only display in the window overlooking Diagon Alley is a single wand lying on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. Within, there are countless narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling and a spindly-legged chair\" (which Hagrid breaks when he sits upon it). \n Mr. Ollivander , the pale-eyed, white-haired shopkeeper, makes and sells magic wands to witches and wizards as they enter school or break their old wands. He remembers every wand he has ever sold. To determine the best wand for a witch or wizard, Mr Ollivander measures various body parts (including, in Harry's case, between his nostrils) and then checks the reactions of various wands to the buyer, a process to which he refers as \"the wand choosing the wizard.\" \n The shop closed when Mr Ollivander went missing in  Half-Blood Prince , Voldemort having ordered his Death Eaters to kidnap him to attempt to discover more about the link between his own and Harry's wand. Harry rescues Ollivander in  Deathly Hallows . \n Potage's Cauldron Shop [ edit ] \n Potage's Cauldron Shop  sells different varieties and sizes of  cauldrons , including copper,  brass ,  pewter , silver, self-stirring, collapsible, and solid gold, according to a sign outside the shop. Hogwarts requires its students to have a size 2 pewter cauldron (as listed in the Philosopher's Stone book list). The Cauldron Shop is very near to the entrance from The Leaky Cauldron. [PS\u00a0Ch.5] \n Quality Quidditch Supplies [ edit ] \n Quality Quidditch Supplies  sells  broomsticks  and  Quidditch -related items. The store windows often draw young customers to gaze longingly at the merchandise. Its most famous items on display are the Nimbus 2000 and the Firebolt  broomsticks , both of which Harry would eventually own. The Firebolt is a national racing broom that professional leagues use. Harry spent the summer before his third year gazing at the brand new Firebolt racing broom in the display window, the price of which was only available upon request. Ron had previously longed for a full set of  Chudley Cannons  robes offered at the shop. \n Slug and Jiggers Apothecary [ edit ] \nSlug & Jiggers Apothecary, Diagon Alley \n The  Apothecary  sells  scales , potions and potion ingredients. The shop is quite fascinating despite its very bad smell (a mixture of bad eggs and rotten cabbage). [PS\u00a0Ch.5]  The inside includes barrels of slimy stuff on the floor, jars of herbs, dried roots and bright powders on the shelves, and bundles of feathers, strings of fangs and snarled claws hanging from the ceiling. [PS\u00a0Ch.5]  Harry regularly buys ingredients, as well as his scales, from the Apothecary. \n Some of the ingredients available are silver  unicorn  horns (for twenty-one  Galleons  each), glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop), and Dragon liver (seventeen Sickles an ounce). \n Stalls [ edit ] \n As well as many shops, Diagon Alley also contains small stalls, which sell a wide variety of magical objects, sweets, and trinkets. In  Half-Blood Prince , many witches and wizards try to take advantage of the fear created by Voldemort's return. They set up stalls selling amulets and other objects, which supposedly protect you against werewolves,  Dementors  and  Inferi . These \"dark magic protection\" stalls, however, are illegal, and likely scams.  Arthur Weasley  is the one in charge of arresting their owners. \n Twilfitt and Tatting's [ edit ] \n Twilfitt and Tatting's  is a wizarding clothing shop located in Diagon Alley, mentioned in  Half-Blood Prince  by  Narcissa Malfoy , who claims she would shop there rather than shopping in Madam Malkin's due to the presence of Harry, Ron, and Hermione (mostly Hermione, whom the Malfoys look down upon due to her blood status). By the tone in Narcissa's voice, it is implied to be slightly more upscale than Malkin's. \n Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes [ edit ] \n Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes  is a popular joke shop that started as a small school business created by  Fred and George Weasley  in the fourth book. It opened its doors at Number\u00a093  Diagon Alley  in the summer of the sixth book, using Harry Potter's Triwizard Tournament Winnings as starting capital. Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes sells joke and trick items, useful novelties, sweets, and  Defence Against the Dark Arts  items. The front of the shop is described as a fireworks display against the muffled backdrop of dull shops. Some of their products are U-No-Poo, Skiving Snackboxes, trick wands, spell-checking and Smart Answer Quills, reusable Hangmans, Daydream Charms, muggle magic tricks, Edible Dark Marks, Shield Products, Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, Decoy Detonators, joke cauldrons, Wonderwitch beauty products and 10-second pimple vanishers, Pygmy Puffs, love potions, and more. The front of the shop has a sign advertising U-No-Poo: Why are you worrying about You-Know-Who? You should be worrying about U-No-Poo, the constipation sensation that's gripping the nation! \n Fred and George started using the name \"Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes\" in  Goblet of Fire  for a mail order business selling merchandise, including sweets to help students skip classes. After an early departure from Hogwarts in  Order of the Phoenix , the two Weasleys set up their shop in Diagon Alley, which quickly became a huge success. \n Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes had to be temporarily shut down in  Deathly Hallows , because the Death Eaters were keeping an eye on all the Weasleys, but Fred and George continued to run an Owl-Order service. In interviews post-publication of  Deathly Hallows,  Rowling has said that George (after Fred died) reopened the  Diagon Alley  store, that \"it became a tremendous money-spinner,\"and that Ron worked for him there after taking  Auror  training and going to work for the Ministry of Magic. [33]  In the play  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , Ron runs the store nineteen years after the events of the Deathly Hallows. \n Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment [ edit ] \nWiseacre's Wizarding Equipment Shop in Diagon Alley \n Sells all sorts of equipment used in the wizard world. Harry buys his first telescope here. \n Hogsmeade [ edit ] \n Hogsmeade Village \n Hogsmeade Village in  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \n Harry Potter  location \n Type \n Shopping street/Residential Village in Scotland \n First appearance \n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \n Hogsmeade Village , or simply  Hogsmeade , is the only settlement in Britain inhabited solely by wizards, witches, and other magical beings, and is located to the northwest of  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . It was founded by medieval wizard Hengist of Woodcroft [34]  who fled to Scotland to escape Muggle persecution of wizards in Northumberland. Much of Hogsmeade's architecture reflects its medieval origin; the village is known for its leaning medieval houses the most famous of which being the Three Broomsticks, an ancient inn built on the site of Woodcroft's home, and the backdrop for such dramatic wizarding events as the 1612 rebellion of Britain's goblins (the upper rooms of the inn served as the headquarters for the Ministry of Magic in its attempts to put down the insurrection in the  Highlands ). Hogsmeade primarily consists of a single thoroughfare, called High Street, on which most shops and other magical venues reside; however, unnamed alleyways branching off from the main road are also home to such historic places as the Hog's Head Inn and Madame Puddifoot's Teashop. Students of Hogwarts who are in their third year and above are permitted to visit Hogsmeade during scheduled visits, to shop and mingle with friends un-chaperoned, as long as they have a signed  permission slip  from a parent or guardian. Mainly, students frequent a  high street  in the village which contains the named speciality shops and  pubs  in the series. Otherwise, they wander on to observe the infamous Shrieking Shack. Hogsmeade gives its name to the train station which serves as one end of the route traveled by the Hogwarts Express to transport students to and from London. Students must walk or take a carriage to travel between Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. \n Hogsmeade remained unseen in the  Harry Potter  film series  until 2004's  Prisoner of Azkaban . The village has since appeared again in  Order of the Phoenix ,  Half-Blood Prince  and  Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 . In all of these, the village is seen under heavy caps of snow. [35] \n The Three Broomsticks [ edit ] \n The Three Broomsticks  is a well known inn and pub located on High Street in the village of Hogsmeade. It is known for its delicious  butterbeer  and its beautiful owner  Madam Rosmerta , who lives above the pub. The Three Broomsticks is a favoured destination among Hogwarts students and staff, although in  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , Hagrid mentions visiting the Hog's Head. It is the site of important events in the series, including Harry's interview with  Rita Skeeter  in his fifth year. It is described as being warm, smoky, crowded, and noisy. As well as butterbeer, it serves firewhisky (although seemingly not to students, as mentioned by Ron in the Hog's Head in the fifth year), gillywater, Rosmerta's oak-matured mead, and many muggle drinks. Madam Rosmerta usually works at the bar, in the front or the side of the room. There is a fireplace in the back of the pub and an inn above. \n Honeydukes [ edit ] \n Honeydukes  is a popular sweets shop located in Hogsmeade that is usually crowded with Hogwarts students and occasionally even the professors of Hogwarts. The shop is filled with many different kinds of wonderful and wild sweets, such as Bertie Botts Every Flavoured Beans, Cauldron Cakes, Blood-Flavoured Lollipops, Acid Pops, Droobles Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Wands, Exploding Bonbons, Skeletal Sweets, and so much more. There is also a secret passageway in the cellar of Honeydukes that leads to the third floor corridor of Hogwarts, behind the large stone statue of Gunhilda of Gorsemoor. Harry used this entrance to sneak into Hogsmeade in  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . \n Zonko's Joke Shop [ edit ] \n Zonko's Joke Shop  has jokes and tricks that can \"fulfill even  Fred and George's  wildest dreams.\" Some of these include Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and Nose-Biting Teacups. It closes down in  Half-Blood Prince . Fred and George later buy the shop. \n Hogsmeade Station [ edit ] \n Hogsmeade Station  is the closest train stop to Hogwarts; the  Hogwarts Express  stops here after travelling from  King's Cross . Scenes involving Hogsmeade Station in the Harry Potter films were shot at  Goathland railway station  on the  North Yorkshire Moors Railway , built in 1865 and virtually unchanged, that serves the village of  Goathland  in the  North York Moors . According to Rowling's illustrations, Hogsmeade station is not in Hogsmeade, but on the opposite side of the lake. [36] \n The Hog's Head [ edit ] \n The Hog's Head  is another  pub , which often attracts a more disreputable clientele than the Three Broomsticks, and many of the customers hide their faces out of a desire not to be recognised. The hanging sign in front of the pub has a severed boar's head, leaking blood onto the white cloth around it. The pub itself is filthy, with the floor covered with layers of dirt and the windows smeared with so much grime that little light gets through. The main floor is a single room, but there are additional rooms on the upper floors. Harry notes that the pub smells strongly of goats. The barman and owner is  Aberforth Dumbledore , the brother of Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, although this is not revealed until the final book. \n Despite its seedy reputation, the Hog's Head has been host to several important events in the world of Harry Potter. The inn was the headquarters of the 1612  Goblin  Rebellion. A few months before Harry was born, it was here that the  Seer   Sybill Trelawney  revealed the prophecy connecting Voldemort and Harry during an interview with Dumbledore for the position of  Divination  teacher at Hogwarts, while Professor  Severus Snape  listens to the first part of the prophecy. It is also where Hagrid wins an illegal  dragon  egg ( Norbert ) while gambling with a disguised servant of Voldemort. In  Order of the Phoenix , the first meeting of  Dumbledore's Army  is secretly held at the Hog's Head. \n During  Deathly Hallows , Aberforth reveals a secret passage that leads into Hogwarts' Room of Requirement, where Dumbledore's Army has set up headquarters. The Hog's Head entrance is hidden behind a portrait of  Ariana Dumbledore , the younger sister of Albus and Aberforth. Before the Battle of Hogwarts begins, the passage is used to evacuate underage students from the school. The remaining members of Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix gather at the Hog's Head before entering the castle through this passage to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters. \n The name of the tavern refers to an archaic unit of liquid measurement, the  hogshead . It may also be an  allusion  to the \"Boar's Head Tavern\" from the play  Henry IV, Part 1  by  William Shakespeare . Much like The Hog's Head, Shakespeare's tavern is the haunt of some less-than-reputable characters. It should also be noted that there is a second hand music shop by the name of \"The Hog's Head\" less than a mile from JK Rowling's residence in Edinburgh, Scotland. The shop was established four years before  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  was released. \n Dervish & Banges [ edit ] \n A shop that sells and repairs magical equipment,  Dervish & Banges  is located near the end of the  High Street . \n Gladrags Wizardwear [ edit ] \n Gladrags Wizardwear  sells clothing. There are other branches in London and Paris. It is full of quirky merchandise, and appears to specialise in strange and unusual socks, where Harry buys Dobby a selection of wacky socks, in thanks for helping him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. \n Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop [ edit ] \n Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop  sells a range of wizarding stationery like quills, ink, parchment, envelopes, seals, etc. \n Madam Puddifoot's [ edit ] \n Located on a little side street off the main High Street,  Madam Puddifoot's  is a small teashop favourite among Hogwarts couples out on dates. It's described as a cramped, steamy place where everything is adorned with bows or frills. The small, circular tables are set for two. On  Valentine's Day  Madam Puddifoot hires floating golden cherubs to throw pink confetti on visiting couples. It was at Madam Puddifoot's that Harry celebrated his Valentine's Day with  Cho Chang , in the fifth book, Order of the Phoenix. \n Post Office [ edit ] \n The  Post Office  is filled with at least two to three hundred  owls , ranging from  great grey owls  to tiny  scops  (the latter for \"local deliveries only\"), hooting down from colour-coded shelves. These owls deliver mail to people in the wizarding world. The shelves are colour-coded based on how quickly they will arrive at their destination. \n Shrieking Shack [ edit ] \n The  Shrieking Shack , on the outskirts of Hogsmeade, is believed to be the most haunted building in Great Britain. It stands a little way above the rest of Hogsmeade, with boarded-up windows and an overgrown garden. It's described to be slightly creepy even in daylight. Connected to Hogwarts by a secret tunnel underneath the  Whomping Willow , which was planted especially to conceal the tunnel, the Shrieking Shack was used by  Remus Lupin , a  werewolf , to hide during the full moon to avoid harming fellow students or others. The villagers heard Lupin's howls while he resided there, and mistook it for violent spirits. This rumour, encouraged by Dumbledore, led to the Shrieking Shack being officially regarded as the most haunted building in Britain. Apparently, the tunnel through the Whomping Willow is the only way to get in to the Shrieking Shack. \n In  Prisoner of Azkaban , the Shrieking Shack becomes part of the dramatic conclusion of the book when Sirius returns to the school. He drags Ron and his pet rat, Scabbers, there intending to kill Scabbers. It is revealed that Scabbers is the  Animagus   Peter Pettigrew , Black's former friend who had betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, a crime for which Black had been blamed and sentenced to lifetime imprisonment in Azkaban. In the book  Deathly Hallows , Snape is killed in the Shrieking Shack by Voldemort's snake,  Nagini . \n Government-affiliated locales [ edit ] \n Azkaban [ edit ] \n Not to be confused with  Abkhazia ,  Alcatraz ,  Ashgabat , or  Azerbaijan . \nDamaged Azkaban as seen in  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . \n Azkaban  is a prison where wizards who violate the laws of the British  wizarding world  are sent. Only one other such prison,  Nurmengard , is mentioned in the books. According to  Half-Blood Prince , Azkaban is \"in the middle of the  North Sea \". Sirius Black says that when he escaped from Azkaban while in his animagus form as a dog, he swam to Britain and then travelled northwards to get to Hogwarts. This implies that Azkaban is at a lower latitude than Hogwarts, which is in Scotland. Although Azkaban's appearance is not described in detail in the books, it is mentioned to have grounds outside the prison where prisoners who have died are buried. [HP4]  In the movie adaptations it appears to be a tall triangular building, somewhat hollow in the middle. \n Many of the prisoners were supporters of Voldemort (known as Death Eaters), though some misunderstandings have resulted in others' imprisonment. For instance, Sirius Black was imprisoned without trial after Peter Pettigrew killed a dozen Muggles, faked his own death, and framed Sirius for these crimes; Sirius escapes after serving 12 years. [HP3]  Two years later, Harry is threatened with a term in Azkaban after he performs a Patronus Charm that saves both him and  his cousin Dudley  from a Dementor attack. [HP5]  Performing any of the  Unforgivable Curses  on a human is punishable by a mandatory  whole life sentence  in Azkaban, but that ban has been lifted for Aurors during wartime. Several characters throughout the series have performed the curses and not been punished accordingly. Other crimes which merit imprisonment here include assaulting the Ministry (for example, the Death Eaters detained in  Order of the Phoenix ), trespassing in the Ministry (Sturgis Podmore in  Order of the Phoenix ), being an unregistered Animagus [HP5] , and impersonating an  Inferius . [HP6] \n Azkaban has a reputation of evil and fear throughout the series. As mentioned at the start of the series, Azkaban is guarded by the  Dementors , working under the  Ministry of Magic . The large presence of Dementors renders the inmates incapable of happiness and forces them to relive their worst memories, as they become gradually helpless and often severely insane. According to Sirius, many inmates simply stop eating and eventually die of starvation. Sirius's reasoning for this is that \"They simply lose their will to live\". As Dementors are extremely difficult to injure \u2013 the only spell effective against them is the  Patronus Charm  \u2013 Azkaban was long considered impossible to escape from, until Sirius escaped (although  Barty Crouch Jr  had previously broken out with the help of his parents); however, Dumbledore claimed he could break out of Azkaban if he wished to do so. [HP5] \n In  Order of the Phoenix , ten of Voldemort's most dangerous and loyal followers escaped, including  Bellatrix Lestrange . Dumbledore was always vocal in declaring that it was a mistake to guard Voldemort's greatest supporters with Dementors, who have the most to gain if Voldemort returned to power. He is proven right, as the Dementors leave their posts at Azkaban and join ranks with Voldemort. The prison is still in use, but greatly weakened by the revolt of its most effective wardens. Azkaban also had various wizard guards, who kept the Dementors mostly in check and managed the rare prison visits. By the start of  Deathly Hallows , there had been another mass break-out of Death Eaters from Azkaban. Upon Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry, many political prisoners are sent to Azkaban by Ministry traitor  Dolores Umbridge , including  Xenophilius Lovegood  and Muggle-borns persecuted under Voldemort's implementation of anti-Muggle legislation. Such victims are released following Voldemort's downfall, and Umbridge is imprisoned there, along with whichever Death Eaters survived the Battle of Hogwarts. \n Following Voldemort's ultimate demise,  Kingsley Shacklebolt  ends the use of Dementors at Azkaban, their presence having always been a mark of the underlying corruption of the Ministry. [37] \n Magical Congress of the United States of America [ edit ] \n The Magical Congress of the United States of America (shortened MACUSA) is the magical body in charge of governing the wizarding population of the United States of America. It is led by the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America. Unlike the  No-Maj  United States Congress, which is divided into a House of Representatives and a Senate, the MACUSA is unicameral. The MACUSA is located within the  Woolworth Building  in downtown New York City and has hundreds of stories. \n Newt Scamander visited this building in the film  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  where he was brought in by Porpentina \"Tina\" Goldstein for threatening the Statute of Secrecy by presenting his magic in front of Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj. \n Ministry of Magic [ edit ] \n Main article:  Ministry of Magic \n St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries [ edit ] \n St Mungo 's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries  is a hospital within the  Harry Potter  universe. Medics at the hospital are not called doctors, but are known as Healers and wear lime-green robes. [38]  Founded by famous wizard Healer Mungo Bonham, St Mungo's is located in London. [38]  It was established to treat magical maladies, injuries or illnesses endemic to the Wizarding World. To enter the premises, one has to step through the window of what appears to be a derelict department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd. [38]  The exteriors of the hospital are red-bricked and dirty, which is the complete opposite of the interiors. Inside, everything is very neat and looks exactly as a hospital should. There are six floors. The emblem of St Mungo's is a magic  wand  crossed with a  bone . [38]  This is the hospital where  Arthur Weasley  is sent after he was attacked by Voldemort's snake,  Nagini , in the  Ministry of Magic  and  Minerva McGonagall  is hospitalised from severe stunning when Hagrid is forced out of Hogwarts. During one visit, Harry and company happen across  Neville Longbottom , who has come with his grandmother  Augusta Longbottom  to visit his  parents  in the long-term care ward. They also find former professor  Gilderoy Lockhart  there, still suffering from the effects of a backfired Memory Charm. \n Nurmengard [ edit ] \n Nurmengard  is the prison that  Gellert Grindelwald  built to keep his enemies and Muggles in. The entrance is marked with the symbol of the  Deathly Hallows , along with the legend  \"For the greater good\" . After  Dumbledore  defeated Grindelwald, the prisoners were released and Grindelwald himself was imprisoned in the top-most cell. Nurmengard is depicted in the final book when Voldemort arrives at the prison looking for Grindelwald and information about the  Elder Wand . After Grindelwald refuses to give him any information, Voldemort kills him in his own prison. \n Platform Nine and Three-Quarters [ edit ] \nThe Platform 9\u00be sign is situated in the western departures concourse of  London King's Cross railway station , close to platforms 9 and 10, below the walkway leading to the main building. \nThe  GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall , the steam engine used in the film series as the Hogwarts Express \n Hogwarts Express \n Legend \n Hogsmeade for  Hogwarts \n Anglo-Scottish border \n King's Cross station London \n The ride on the  Hogwarts Express  starts from  King's Cross railway station   platform \u00a09\u00be, which is hidden from view, and reached by walking through the barrier between platforms\u00a09 and 10. \n Rowling discovered after the books were published that she had confused the layout of  King's Cross  with that of  Euston station , and that platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross were not the ones between which she had meant her magical platform to be placed. [39]  There is no platform between lines\u00a09 and 10 at King's Cross. To solve this, the filmmakers re-numbered platforms\u00a04 and 5 for the duration of filming. In reality, at both King's Cross and Euston, platforms\u00a09 and 10 are separated by railway lines. The exterior shots in the film are of the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, which is part of  St Pancras Station , adjacent to King's Cross station. From the outside St Pancras is much more visually dramatic than King's Cross. \n A plaque depicting the supposed location was placed on the wall in the building containing platforms 9 to 11, along with a luggage trolley 'stuck' halfway through the wall. During the station's extensive renovation works, it was moved temporarily to an exterior wall on the  Euston Road , and then in 2012 to the new western departures concourse. A wrought iron 'Platform 9\u00be' gate used as part of the film set is preserved at the  National Railway Museum .
