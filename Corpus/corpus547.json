It consists of more than 700  islands ,  cays , and  islets  in the  Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of  Cuba  and  Hispaniola  ( Haiti  and the  Dominican Republic ), northwest of the  Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the  US  state of  Florida , and east of the  Florida Keys . The capital is  Nassau  on the island of  New Providence . The designation of \"the Bahamas\" can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the  Turks and Caicos Islands . As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the  Royal Bahamas Defence Force , the Bahamas territory encompasses 470,000\u00a0km 2  (180,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of ocean space. \n The Bahamas is the site of  Columbus ' first landfall in the  New World  in 1492. At that time, the islands were inhabited by the  Lucayan , a branch of the  Arawakan -speaking  Taino  people. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when  English  colonists from  Bermuda  settled on the island of  Eleuthera . \n The Bahamas became a  British   crown colony  in 1718, when the British clamped down on  piracy . After the  American War of Independence , the Crown resettled thousands of  American Loyalists  in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves; the  Royal Navy  resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships,  American slaves  and Seminoles escaped here from Florida, and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Today,  Afro-Bahamians  make up nearly 90% of the population. \n The Bahamas became an independent  Commonwealth realm  in 1973, retaining the British monarch, then and currently  Queen Elizabeth II , as its head of state. In terms of  gross domestic product  per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the  Americas  (following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and finance.

Alternatively, it may originate from  Guanahani , a local name of unclear meaning. [14] \n A peculiarity of the name is that the word  The  is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is, therefore, capitalised. So in contrast to \"the Congo\" and \"the United Kingdom\", it is proper to write \"The Bahamas\". \n History [ edit ] \n Main article:  History of the Bahamas \n This section  needs additional citations for  verification .

(July 2017)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \nA depiction of Columbus' first landing, claiming possession of the  New World  for Spain in  caravels ; the  Ni\u00f1a  and the  Pinta , on Watling Island, an island of The Bahamas that the natives called  Guanahani  and that he named  San Salvador , on 12 October 1492. [15] \n Taino  people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from  Hispaniola  and  Cuba  around the 11th century, having migrated there from South America. They came to be known as the  Lucayan people . An estimated 30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of  Christopher Columbus ' arrival in 1492. \n Columbus's first landfall in the New World was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as  Guanahani ). Some researchers believe this site to be present-day  San Salvador Island  (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on  Samana Cay , according to calculations made in 1986 by  National Geographic  writer and editor  Joseph Judge , based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and exchanged goods with them. \n The Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting  diseases  to which they had no  immunity ; half of the Taino died from  smallpox  alone. [16]  The population of the Bahamas was severely diminished. [17] \n In 1648, the  Eleutherian Adventurers , led by  William Sayle , migrated from Bermuda. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named  Eleuthera \u2014the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled  New Providence , naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers  salvaged goods from wrecks . \n In 1670,  King Charles II  granted the islands to the  Lords Proprietors  of the Carolinas in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing  governors , and administering the country. [18]  In 1684 Spanish  corsair  Juan de Alcon  raided the capital , Charles Town (later renamed  Nassau ). In 1703, a joint Franco-Spanish expedition  briefly occupied  the Bahamian capital during the  War of the Spanish Succession . \n 18th\u201319th centuries [ edit ] \nSign at  Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park  commemorating hundreds of  African-American  slaves who escaped to freedom in the early 1820s in the Bahamas \n During proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for  pirates , including the infamous  Blackbeard  ( circa  1680\u20131718). To put an end to the ' Pirates' republic ' and restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a  crown colony  in 1718 under the royal governorship of  Woodes Rogers . After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy. [19]  In 1720, Rogers led local  militia  to drive off a  Spanish attack . \n During the American War of Independence in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore  Esek Hopkins .  US Marines  occupied the capital of Nassau for a  fortnight . \n In 1782, following the British defeat at  Yorktown , a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city  surrendered without a fight . Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms of the  Treaty of Paris . Before the news was received, however, the  islands were recaptured  by a small British force led by  Andrew Deveaux . \n After American independence, the British resettled some 7,300  Loyalists  with their slaves in the Bahamas, and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory. \n In 1807, the British abolished the  slave trade , followed by the United States the next year. During the following decades, the  Royal Navy  intercepted the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships. \n In the 1820s during the period of the  Seminole Wars  in Florida, hundreds of American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from  Cape Florida  to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest  Andros Island , where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27  sloops , with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at  Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park . [20] [21]  Some of their descendants in Red Bays continue African Seminole traditions in basket making and grave marking. [22] \n The United States'  National Park Service , which administers the National  Underground Railroad  Network to Freedom, is working with the African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC) in Nassau on development to identify Red Bays as a site related to American slaves' search for freedom. The museum has researched and documented the African Seminoles' escape from southern Florida. It plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas. [23] \n In 1818, [24]  the Home Office in London had ruled that \"any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the  British West Indies  would be manumitted.\" This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835. [25]  The American slave ships  Comet  and  Encomium  used in the United States domestic  coastwise slave trade , were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the  Comet  and 48 on the  Encomium . Britain finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations. [26] [27] \n Slavery was  abolished in the British Empire  on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial officials freed 78 American slaves from the  Enterprise , which went into Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the  Hermosa , which wrecked off Abaco Island in 1840. [28]  The most notable case was that of the  Creole  in 1841: as a result of a  slave revolt  on board, the leaders ordered the American brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in  New Orleans . The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands. The  Creole   case  has been described as the \"most successful slave revolt in U.S. history\". [29] \n These incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and  Great Britain . They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. But, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the  Creole  slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships. \n 20th century [ edit ] \n Edward VIII , the  Duke of Windsor  and  Governor of the Bahamas  from 1940 to 1945 \n In August 1940, after his abdication of the British throne, the  Duke of Windsor  was installed as  Governor of the Bahamas , arriving with his wife, the  Duchess . Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they \"tried to make the best of a bad situation\". [30]  He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as \"a third-class British colony\". [31] \n He opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the \"Out Islands\" that November, on  Axel Wenner-Gren 's yacht, which caused controversy; [32]  the  British Foreign Office  strenuously objected because they had been advised (mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the  Luftwaffe  commander  Hermann G\u00f6ring  of Nazi Germany. [32] [33] \n The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in  Nassau  in June 1942, when there was a \"full-scale riot\". [34]  Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on \"mischief makers \u2013  communists \" and \"men of Central European  Jewish  descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft\". [35] \n The Duke resigned the post on 16 March 1945. [36] [37] \n Post-Second World War [ edit ] \nSign at the entrance of the Sir Roland Symonette Park in  North Eleuthera  district commemorating Sir  Roland Theodore Symonette , the Bahamas' first  Premier \n Modern political development began after the  Second World War . The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, with  Sir Roland Symonette , of the  United Bahamian Party , as the first Premier. \n A new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964. [38]  In 1967,  Lynden Pindling  of the  Progressive Liberal Party , became the first native born Premier of the majority native Bahamian colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to  Prime Minister . In 1968, Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence. [39]  A new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs was adopted in 1968. [40] \n The  British House of Lords  voted to give the Bahamas its independence on 22 June 1973. [41]   Prince Charles  delivered the official documents to  Prime Minister   Lynden Pindling , officially declaring the Bahamas a fully independent nation on 10 July 1973. [42]  It joined the  Commonwealth of Nations  on the same day. [43]   Sir Milo Butler  was appointed the first  Governor-General of the Bahamas  (the official representative of  Queen Elizabeth II ) shortly after independence. The Bahamas joined the  International Monetary Fund  and the  World Bank  on 22 August 1973, [44]  and it joined the  United Nations  on 18 September 1973. [45] \n Based on the twin pillars of tourism and  offshore finance , the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international  narcotics trafficking  and illegal immigration from Haiti continue to be issues. \n The  University of The Bahamas  (UB) is the national higher education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, UB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas. The University of the Bahamas was chartered on November 10, 2016 \n Geography [ edit ] \n Main article:  Geography of the Bahamas \nThe Bahamas from space.  NASA   Aqua  satellite image, 2009 \n The country lies between latitudes  20\u00b0  and  28\u00b0N , and longitudes  72\u00b0  and  80\u00b0W . \n In 1864, the  Governor of the Bahamas  reported that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony. [46] \n The closest island to the United States is  Bimini , which is also known as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of  Abaco  is to the east of  Grand Bahama . The southeasternmost island is  Inagua . The largest island is  Andros Island . Other inhabited islands include  Eleuthera ,  Cat Island ,  Rum Cay ,  Long Island ,  San Salvador Island ,  Ragged Island ,  Acklins ,  Crooked Island ,  Exuma ,  Berry Islands  and  Mayaguana .  Nassau , capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of  New Providence . \n All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to 20\u00a0m (49 to 66\u00a0ft). The highest point in the country is  Mount Alvernia  (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation of 63 metres (207\u00a0ft). \nDamaged homes in the Bahamas in the aftermath of  Hurricane Wilma  in 2005 \n To the southeast, the  Turks and Caicos Islands , and three more extensive submarine features called  Mouchoir Bank ,  Silver Bank  and  Navidad Bank , are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas. \n Castaway Cay [ edit ] \n Main article:  Castaway Cay \n Disney Has it own private island in the Bahamas called  Castaway Cay  It is located near Great Abaco Island and was formerly known as Gorda Cay. In 1997, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 99-year land lease for the cay from the Bahamian government, set to expire in 2096 \n Climate [ edit ] \n See also:  Geography of the Bahamas \u00a7\u00a0Climate \n The climate of the Bahamas is  tropical savannah climate  or  Aw  according to  K\u00f6ppen climate classification . The low latitude, warm tropical  Gulf Stream , and low  elevation  give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. As such, there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures can fall below 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the North American mainland. There is only an 8\u00a0\u00b0C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days [47]  of sunlight annually. \n Tropical storms and hurricanes can on occasion impact the Bahamas. In 1992,  Hurricane Andrew  passed over the northern portions of the islands, and  Hurricane Floyd  passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999. \n Climate data for Nassau \n Month \n Jan \n Feb \n Mar \n Apr \n May \n Jun \n Jul \n Aug \n Sep \n Oct \n Nov \n Dec \n Year \n Average high \u00b0C (\u00b0F) \n 25.4 \n(77.7) \n 25.5 \n(77.9) \n 26.6 \n(79.9) \n 27.9 \n(82.2) \n 29.7 \n(85.5) \n 31.0 \n(87.8) \n 32.0 \n(89.6) \n 32.1 \n(89.8) \n 31.6 \n(88.9) \n 29.9 \n(85.8) \n 27.8 \n(82) \n 26.2 \n(79.2) \n 28.8 \n(83.9) \n Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F) \n 21.4 \n(70.5) \n 21.4 \n(70.5) \n 22.3 \n(72.1) \n 23.8 \n(74.8) \n 25.6 \n(78.1) \n 27.2 \n(81) \n 28.0 \n(82.4) \n 28.1 \n(82.6) \n 27.7 \n(81.9) \n 26.2 \n(79.2) \n 24.2 \n(75.6) \n 22.3 \n(72.1) \n 24.85 \n(76.73) \n Average low \u00b0C (\u00b0F) \n 17.3 \n(63.1) \n 17.3 \n(63.1) \n 17.9 \n(64.2) \n 19.6 \n(67.3) \n 21.4 \n(70.5) \n 23.3 \n(73.9) \n 24.0 \n(75.2) \n 24.0 \n(75.2) \n 23.7 \n(74.7) \n 22.5 \n(72.5) \n 20.6 \n(69.1) \n 18.3 \n(64.9) \n 20.8 \n(69.5) \n Average  precipitation  mm (inches) \n 39.4 \n(1.551) \n 49.5 \n(1.949) \n 54.4 \n(2.142) \n 69.3 \n(2.728) \n 105.9 \n(4.169) \n 218.2 \n(8.591) \n 160.8 \n(6.331) \n 235.7 \n(9.28) \n 164.1 \n(6.461) \n 161.8 \n(6.37) \n 80.5 \n(3.169) \n 49.8 \n(1.961) \n 1,389.4 \n(54.701) \n Average precipitation days \n 8 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 10 \n 15 \n 17 \n 19 \n 17 \n 15 \n 10 \n 8 \n 140 \n Mean monthly  sunshine hours \n 220.1 \n 220.4 \n 257.3 \n 276.0 \n 269.7 \n 231.0 \n 272.8 \n 266.6 \n 213.0 \n 223.2 \n 222.0 \n 213.9 \n 2,886 \n Source:  World Meteorological Organization  ( UN ), [48]   Hong Kong Observatory  (sun only) [49] \n Average Sea Temperature \n Jan \n Feb \n Mar \n Apr \n May \n Jun \n Jul \n Aug \n Sep \n Oct \n Nov \n Dec \n 23\u00a0\u00b0C\n 73\u00a0\u00b0F \n 23\u00a0\u00b0C\n 73\u00a0\u00b0F \n 24\u00a0\u00b0C\n 75\u00a0\u00b0F \n 26\u00a0\u00b0C\n 79\u00a0\u00b0F \n 27\u00a0\u00b0C\n 81\u00a0\u00b0F \n 28\u00a0\u00b0C\n 82\u00a0\u00b0F \n 28\u00a0\u00b0C\n 82\u00a0\u00b0F \n 28\u00a0\u00b0C\n 82\u00a0\u00b0F \n 28\u00a0\u00b0C\n 82\u00a0\u00b0F \n 27\u00a0\u00b0C\n 81\u00a0\u00b0F \n 26\u00a0\u00b0C\n 79\u00a0\u00b0F \n 24\u00a0\u00b0C\n 75\u00a0\u00b0F \n Geology [ edit ] \n The Bahamas Platform, which includes the Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the  Blake Plateau , formed about 150  Ma , not long after the formation of the  North Atlantic . The 6.4\u00a0km thick  limestones , which predominately make up The Bahamas, date back to the  Cretaceous . These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the  North American continental crust . Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight. Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands. Then, at about 80 Ma, the area became flooded by the  Gulf Stream . This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the  Cay Sal Bank , plus the  Little and Great Bahama Banks . Sedimentation from the \"carbonate factory\" of each bank, or  atoll , continues today at the rate of about 2\u00a0cm per  kyr .  Coral reefs  form the \"retaining walls\" of these atolls, within which  oolites  and  pellets  form. [50] \n Coral growth was greater through the  Tertiary , until the start of the  Ice Ages , and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m. In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30 m below sea level. Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about 3\u00a0\u00b0C and the salinity by 0.5 per cent.  Cemented   ooids  are referred to as grapestone. Additionally, giant  stromatolites  are found off the  Exuma Cays . [50] : 22,29\u201330 \n Sea level changes  resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form  sand dunes  with distinct  cross-bedding . Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly  lithified  through the action of rainwater, called  eolianite . Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m, though Cat Island has a ridge 60 m in height. The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps. [50] : 41\u201359,61\u201364 \n Solution weathering  of the limestone results in a \"Bahamian  Karst \" topography. This includes  potholes ,  Blue holes  such as  Dean's Blue Hole ,  sinkholes ,  beachrock  such as the  Bimini Road  (\"pavements of Atlantis\"),  limestone crust , caves due to the lack of rivers, and  sea caves . Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros  Fault  line.  Tidal flats  and  tidal creeks  are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as  Great Bahama Canyon  with the evidence of  turbidity currents  and  turbidite  deposition. [50] : 33\u201340,65,72\u201384,86 \n Government and politics [ edit ] \n Main article:  Politics of the Bahamas \nThe  Bahamian Parliament , located in  Nassau \n The Bahamas is a  parliamentary   constitutional monarchy  headed by  Queen Elizabeth II  in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the  Westminster system . The Bahamas is a member of the  Commonwealth of Nations  as a  Commonwealth realm , retaining the Queen as  head of state  (represented by a  Governor-General ). \n Legislative power  is vested In a  bicameral   parliament , which consists of a 38-member  House of Assembly  (the  lower house ), with members elected from  single-member districts , and a 16-member  Senate , with members appointed by the Governor-General, including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice of the  Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition , and three on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term. [51] \n The  Prime Minister  is the  head of government  and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly.  Executive power  is exercised by the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is  Dame Marguerite Pindling , and the current  Prime Minister  is  The Rt. Hon.   Hubert Minnis   M.P. . \n Constitutional safeguards include  freedom of speech ,  press ,  worship ,  movement  and  association . The  Judiciary of the Bahamas  is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on  English law . \n Political culture [ edit ] \n The Bahamas has a  two-party system  dominated by the  centre-left   Progressive Liberal Party  and the  centre-right   Free National Movement . A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the  Bahamas Democratic Movement , the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the  Democratic National Alliance . \n Foreign relations [ edit ] \n Further information:  Foreign relations of the Bahamas \n The Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the  United States  and the  United Kingdom , represented by an ambassador in  Washington  and  High Commissioner  in  London . The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM). \n Armed forces [ edit ] \n Main article:  Royal Bahamas Defence Force \nHMBS Nassau (P-61) \n Its military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which includes a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the  Queen , to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM )'s Regional Security Task Force. \n The RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping  drug smuggling , illegal immigration and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women. \n Administrative divisions [ edit ] \n Main article:  Local government in the Bahamas \nDistricts of the Bahamas \n The districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except  New Providence  (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the \"Local Government Act\" to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee members are elected to represent the various districts. [52] \n Each Councillor or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency. \n The Bahamas uses  drive-on-the-Left  traffic rules throughout the Commonwealth. \n The districts other than New Providence are: \n Acklins \n Berry Islands \n Bimini \n Black Point ,  Exuma \n Cat Island \n Central Abaco \n Central Andros \n Central Eleuthera \n City of Freeport, Grand Bahama \n Crooked Island \n East Grand Bahama \n Exuma \n Grand Cay ,  Abaco \n Harbour Island ,  Eleuthera \n Hope Town ,  Abaco \n Inagua \n Long Island \n Mangrove Cay ,  Andros \n Mayaguana \n Moore's Island ,  Abaco \n North Abaco \n North Andros \n North Eleuthera \n Ragged Island \n Rum Cay \n San Salvador \n South Abaco \n South Andros \n South Eleuthera \n Spanish Wells ,  Eleuthera \n West Grand Bahama \n National flag [ edit ] \n Main article:  Flag of the Bahamas \nNational flag of the Bahamas \n The colours embodied in the design of the Bahamian flag symbolise the strength of the Bahamian people; the design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun and sea) and the economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine. \n Coat of arms [ edit ] \n Main article:  Coat of arms of the Bahamas \nBahamian Coat of Arms \n The coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a  marlin  and a  flamingo , which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands. \n On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the  Santa Mar\u00eda  of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto: [53] \n \"Forward, Upward, Onward Together.\" \n National flower [ edit ] \n The  yellow elder  was chosen as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama islands, and it blooms throughout the year. \n Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s\u2014the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the  Y.W.C.A.  Garden Club. \n They reasoned that other flowers grown there\u2014such as the  bougainvillea ,  hibiscus  and  poinciana \u2014had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the  United States Virgin Islands ) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands. [54] \n Economy [ edit ] \n Main article:  Economy of the Bahamas \n By  the terms of GDP per capita , the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the  Americas . [55]  It was revealed in the  Panama Papers  that The Bahamas is the jurisdiction with the most offshore entities or companies. [56] \n Tourism [ edit ] \n Cruise ships  in Nassau Harbour \n The Bahamas relies on  tourism  to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce. [57]  The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors. \n Financial services [ edit ] \n After tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP. \n The government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the  Central Bank of the Bahamas  (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. [ citation needed ]  The Central Bank administers restrictions and  controls on capital  and money market instruments. The  Bahamas International Securities Exchange  consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited. [ citation needed ] \nA proportional representation of the Bahamas exports. \n The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs,  VAT , licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. [58]  In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%. [1] \n Agriculture [ edit ] \n Further information:  Agriculture in the Bahamas \n Agriculture is the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5\u20137% of total GDP. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include  onions ,  okra ,  tomatoes ,  oranges ,  grapefruit ,  cucumbers ,  sugar cane ,  lemons ,  limes , and  sweet potatoes . \n Demographics [ edit ] \n Main article:  Demographics of the Bahamas \n The Bahamas has an estimated population of 391,232, of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65. It has a population growth rate of 0.925% (2010), with a birth rate of 17.81/1,000 population, death rate of 9.35/1,000, and net migration rate of \u22122.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population. [59]  The  infant mortality rate  is 23.21 deaths/1,000 live births. Residents have a life expectancy at birth of 69.87 years: 73.49 years for females, 66.32 years for males. The total fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010). [1] \n The most populous islands are New Providence, where Nassau, the capital and largest city, is located; [60]  and Grand Bahama, home to the second largest city of  Freeport . [61] \n Racial and ethnic groups [ edit ] \n According to the 99% response rate obtained from the race question on the 2010 Census questionnaire, 90.6% of the population identified themselves as being Black, 4.7% White and 2.1% of a mixed race (Black and White). [1]  according to the CIA Handbook. Other sources indicate whites number up to 12 to 15%, The Bahamas Guide, World Population Review. Three centuries prior, in 1722 when the first official census of the Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population was White and 26% Black. [62] \n Afro-Bahamian  children at a local school \n Since the colonial era of plantations, Africans or Afro-Bahamians have been the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas, whose primary ancestry was based in  West Africa . The first Africans to arrive to the Bahamas were freed slaves from  Bermuda ; they arrived with the  Eleutheran Adventurers  looking for new lives. \n The  Haitian  community in the Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Due to an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014. [63] \n The White Bahamian population are mainly the descendants of the  English Puritans  looking to flee religious persecution in England and  American Loyalists  escaping the  American Revolution  who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively. [64]  Many Southern Loyalists went to the  Abaco Islands , half of whose population was of European descent as of 1985. [65]  The term  white  is usually used to identify Bahamians with Anglo ancestry, as well as \"light-skinned\" Afro-Bahamians. Sometimes Bahamians use the term  Conchy Joe  to describe people of Anglo descent. [66] \n A small portion of the Euro-Bahamian population is descended from  Greek  labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. They make up less than 1% of the nation's population, but have still preserved their distinct  Greek Bahamian  culture. [ citation needed ] \n Bahamians typically identify themselves simply as either  black  or  white . [66] \n Languages [ edit ] \n The  official language  of the Bahamas is English. Many people speak an  English-based creole language  called  Bahamian dialect  (known simply as \"dialect\") or \"Bahamianese.\"  [67]  Laurente Gibbs, a Bahamian writer and actor was the first to coin the latter name in a poem and has since promoted its usage. [68] [69]  Both are used as autoglossonyms. [70]   Haitian Creole , a  French-based creole language  is spoken by Haitians and their descendants, who make up of about 25% of the total population. It is known simply as  Creole [1]  to differentiate languages. [71] Also note that the Bahamas was once under British rule and therefore the English taught in the Bahamian schools is still \"British-based\". \n Religion [ edit ] \n Further information:  Religion in the Bahamas \n According to International Religious Freedom Report 2008 prepared by United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the islands' population is predominantly  Christian .  Protestant  denominations are widespread and collectively account for more than 70% of the population, with  Baptists  representing 35% of the population,  Anglicans  15%,  Pentecostals  8%,  Church of God  5%,  Seventh-day Adventists  5% and  Methodists  4%. There is also a significant  Roman Catholic  community accounting for about 14%. [72]  There are also smaller communities of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Baha'is ,  Hindus ,  Rastafarians  and practitioners of  Obeah . \n Culture [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Culture of the Bahamas  and  Music of the Bahamas \n Junkanoo  celebration in  Nassau \n In the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called \"straw\", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called \"Voodoo dolls\", even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact. [73] \n A form of folk magic ( obeah ) is practiced by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas. [74]  The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law. [75] \n Junkanoo  is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every  Boxing Day  and  New Year's Day . Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day. \n Regattas  are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned  work boats , as well as an onshore festival. \n Many dishes are associated with  Bahamian cuisine , which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the \"Pineapple Fest\" in Gregory Town,  Eleuthera  or the \"Crab Fest\" on Andros. Other significant traditions include  story telling . \n Bahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and Winston Saunders. [76] [77] \n Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas. \n Sport [ edit ] \n Sport is a significant part of Bahamian culture. The national sport is  Cricket . Cricket has been played in the Bahamas from 1846. [78]  It is the oldest sport being played in the country today. The  Bahamas Cricket Association  was formed in 1936 as an organised body. From the 1940s to the 1970s, cricket was played amongst many Bahamians. Bahamas is not a part of the  West Indies Cricket Board , so players are not eligible to play for the  West Indies cricket team . The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, who had previously come from the United Kingdom with a passion for cricket were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the United States. The Bahamian Physical education teachers had no knowledge of the game and instead taught  track & field ,  basketball ,  baseball ,  softball , [79]   volleyball [80]  and  football [81]  where primary and high schools compete against each other. Today cricket is still enjoyed by a few locals and immigrants in the country usually from  Jamaica ,  Guyana ,  Haiti  and  Barbados . Cricket is played on Saturdays and Sundays at Windsor Park and Haynes Oval. \n The only other sporting event that began before  cricket  was  horse racing , which started in 1796. The most popular spectator sports are those imported from United States, such as  basketball , [82]   American football [83]  and  baseball [84]  rather than Great Britain due to the country's close proximity to the United States. Unlike their other Caribbean counterparts,  cricket ,  rugby , and  netball  have proven to be more popular. \n Dexter Cambridge ,  Rick Fox ,  Ian Lockhart  and  Buddy Hield  are a few Bahamians who joined Bahamian  Mychal Thompson  of the  Los Angeles Lakers  in the NBA ranks, [85] [86]  Over the years  American football  has become much more popular than  association football , though not implemented in the high school system yet. Leagues for teens and adults have been developed by the Bahamas American Football Federation. [87]  However association football, commonly known as  'soccer'  in the country, is still a very popular sport amongst high school pupils. Leagues are governed by the  Bahamas Football Association . Recently the Bahamian government has been working closely with  Tottenham Hotspur  of London to promote the sport in the country as well as promoting the Bahamas in the European market. In 2013 'Spurs' became the first Premier League club to play an exhibition match in the Bahamas to face the  Jamaica national football team .  Joe Lewis , the owner of the  Tottenham Hotspur  club, is based in the Bahamas. [88] \n Other popular sports are  swimming , [89]   tennis [90]  and  boxing [91]  where Bahamians have enjoyed some degree of success at the international level. Other sports such as  golf , [92]   rugby league , [93]   rugby union [94]   beach soccer [95]  and  netball  are considered growing sports.  Athletics  commonly known as  track and field  in the country is the most successful sport by far amongst Bahamians. Bahamians have a strong tradition in the  sprints  and jumps. Track and field is probably the most popular spectator sport in the country next to  basketball  due to their success over the years. Triathlons are gaining popularity in Nassau and the Family Islands. \n Bahamians have gone on to win numerous  track and field  medals at  the Olympic Games ,  IAAF World Championships in Athletics ,  Commonwealth Games  and  Pan American Games .  Frank Rutherford  is the first athletics olympic medalist for the country. He won a bronze medal for triple jump during the  1992 Summer Olympics . [96]   Pauline Davis-Thompson ,  Debbie Ferguson ,  Chandra Sturrup ,  Savatheda Fynes  and  Eldece Clarke-Lewis  teamed up for the first athletics Olympic Gold medal for the country when they won the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay at the  2000 Summer Olympics . They are affectionately known as the \"Golden Girls\". [97]   Tonique Williams-Darling  became the first athletics individual Olympic gold medalist when she won the  400m  sprint in  2004 Summer Olympics . [98]  In 2007, with the disqualification of  Marion Jones ,  Pauline Davis-Thompson  was advanced to the gold medal position in the  200 metres at the 2000 Olympics , predating William-Darling. \n The Bahamas were hosts of the first men's senior FIFA tournament to be staged in the Caribbean, the  2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup . [99] \n Education [ edit ] \n Main article:  Education in the Bahamas \n According to 1995 estimates 98.2% of the adult population is literate. [ citation needed ] \n Representation in other media [ edit ] \n Scenes from the final  Jaws  movie ( Jaws: The Revenge ) were filmed on a New Providence Island beach now known as \"Jaws Beach\". \n The fourth official  James Bond film ,  Thunderball  (1965), was partly filmed in  Nassau , where much of the story is set.  Eon Productions  were to return for filming underwater sequences in the famously clear waters, even when a Bond film's story was set elsewhere; for example, for  The Spy Who Loved Me  (1977). \n The unofficial remake of  Thunderball ,  Never Say Never Again  (1983), was similarly partly filmed in the islands, though this version of the story was not as extensively set there. \n The twenty-first official  James Bond film ,  Casino Royale  (2006), was in part set and filmed in the islands. \n The Beatles ' film  Help!  was filmed in part on New Providence Island and Paradise Island also in 1965. \n Nassau is featured in the 2013 video game  Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag  as a pirate haven, housing the main protagonists. Historical pirates are encountered there such as  Benjamin Hornigold ,  Edward Teach /Blackbeard,  Charles Vane ,  \"Calico\" Jack Rackham ,  Anne Bonney  and  Mary Read . \n See also [ edit ] \n West Indies portal \n Caricom portal \n Commonwealth realms portal \n Bahamas portal \n New Spain portal \n   Bahamas  \u2013  Wikipedia book \n Outline of the Bahamas \n Index of Bahamas-related articles \n Bibliography of the Bahamas \n References [ edit ] \n ^  a   b   c   d   e   Bahamas, The .
