[2]  The agenda of social design is inspired by among others'  Victor Papanek \u2019s idea that designers and creative professionals have a  responsibility  and are able to cause real change in the world through good design. Papanek writes about responsible design. Designers can contribute to designing more  ecological  products by carefully selecting the materials they use. Papanek also remarks on designing for people's needs rather than their wants. Responsible design includes many directions and one of these is design for the  Third World . Designers have responsibility over the choices they make in design processes. [3] \n Social design thinking within the design world joins developing human and  social capital  with new products and processes that are  profitable . Profitability and  ownership  of the processes are the cornerstones of  sustainability  that underpins human well-being [ according to whom? ] . Another author that contributes to the development of this definition of social design is  Victor Margolin . He writes in \" The Politics of the Artificial \" about the \"designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well-being.\" This  ideology  is something that social design is built on. [4]  In this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity, aid donations, help etc. It is not voluntary work, but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local  economic development  or livelihood. \n Strategic thinking [ edit ] \n Another starting point for outlining social design is  strategic thinking  of design. Creating policies and implementing them on a civil level. The two poles: tradition and the market economy can, in one of the models for social design, be placed in  interaction , rather than in competition, with each other. An author that has to be mentioned here is  Jacque Fresco  and his Venus Project. He proposes that the future of the social systems needs to be designed by the  scientific method . Social design can then be seen as a process that leads to human capabilities that in turn contributes to their well-being. As  Amartya Sen  writes,  poverty  is seen as deprivation of capabilities. By focusing on capabilities, rather than e.g. income, Amartya Sen suggests that development within various social aspects of life can contribute to general development. Understanding and using social design processes can contribute to the improvement of livelihood [5] \n Performance design [ edit ] \n This section  contains information of unclear or questionable  importance  or  relevance  to the article's subject matter .

Just as there are lighting designers, sound designers, set designers, costume designers and video designers - social designers work with a team to complement a production with social media tools and content. In this context, social design is defined as: \"The strategic implementation of social media to deepen or broaden the nature of an artistic performance.\" \n Designing systems [ edit ] \n Another dimension of social design focuses on designing systems that join the elements of  communication ,  new product development  and the  environment . It is argued that no single area of design is, by itself, sufficient to drive sustainable social development. What is needed is a system of design, one that encompasses all of the areas of design, towards an open system with multiple, self-adjusting and complementary actors that aim for a vision of a loosely defined common set of goals. \n Outside the design world social design appears in a number of professional environments. There are a growing number of artists, especially in Scandinavia, that use the term social design to describe their work, though the work is exhibited within the art world. These are artist like FOS and  Superflex . They come out of a tradition of social art that can be led back to the Futurists, the Dadaists and e.g. the German artist  Joseph Beuys . \n Social world [ edit ] \n The term social design is also increasingly used to describe design of the social world. This definition implicates a perception of a man-made reality, which consequently can only be changed by humans, and  is  changed by humans all the time. In this view social design is inescapable, it is there whether people are aware of it or not. The social reality is created as a result of the sum of all our individual actions. There is an emerging discussion of this concept of social design, which encompasses all other definitions of the term. \n Initiatives [ edit ] \n The World Design Research Initiative aka Worldesign, at the University of Art and Design Helsinki. [6]  Worldesign aims to explore issues relevant to social, welfare, and responsible design and to generate theory, as well as applicable systems or models. Its members produce exhibitions, workshops, and publications, which work as tools for testing and evaluating different social design applications. [7] \n Architects  Arup  Associates designed  The Druk White Lotus School  in the Indian Himalaya along social design principles. [8] \n The  University of Applied Arts Vienna  has a master's degree dedicated to the challenges within urban social systems and related issues. The master programme is oriented towards graduates from diverse fields of study using transdisciplinary teams. Art in synergy with project-related scientific methods and knowledge is seen as a tool for urban innovation. [9] [10] \n The  University of Technology Sydney  introduced a Bachelor of Creative Intelligence & Innovation (BCII) degree in 2014 [11]  which must be completed in combination with another undergraduate degree. With a strong focus on developing novel solutions for social issues, it enables students \"to participate in a future-facing, world-first, transdisciplinary degree that takes multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals \u2013 equipping students to address the complex challenges and untapped opportunities of our times.\" [12] \n Articles [ edit ] \n Benson, E.
