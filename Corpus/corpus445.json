The field is defined by an interest in a set of problems, or an interest in central or foundational concerns in design. In addition to these central problems for design as a whole, many philosophers of design consider these problems as they apply to particular disciplines (e.g.  philosophy of art ). Although most practitioners are  philosophers , several prominent  designers  and  artists  have contributed to the field. For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle [1]  at the Royal Danish Academy. \n Philosophers of design, or philosophers relevant to the philosophical study of design [ edit ] \n Roland Barthes \n Jean Baudrillard \n Albert Borgmann \n Gilles Deleuze \n Umberto Eco \n F\u00e9lix Guattari \n Tony Fry \n Martin Heidegger \n Don Ihde \n Bruno Latour \n Marshal McLuhan \n Bernard Stiegler \n Peter-Paul Verbeek \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Galle, Per.  \"Philosophy of Design\" .
