(October 2008)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n IMF  is an  audio file format  created by  id Software  for the  AdLib   sound card  for use in their  video games . The default  filename extension  is also \"imf\". The abbreviation stands for \"id music file\" or \"id's music format\". \n The format is similar to  MIDI , in that it defines musical notes, and does not support  sampled   digital audio  for sound effects. IMF files store the actual bytes sent to the AdLib's  OPL2  chip, which uses  FM synthesis  to produce audio output. The format is based on the AdLib command syntax, with a few modifications. Due to the limited features and relatively low sound quality, modern games no longer use IMF music. \n Once extracted from a game, IMF files can be played with special sound libraries which emulate AdLib cards. One of the most popular ones is  AdPlug , which can be used, for instance, through its  Winamp  plugin. \n Games [ edit ] \n A large number of songs in id Software's games were composed by  Bobby Prince  in IMF format. Besides id Software, some other  game developers  like  Apogee Software  also used this format to add music to their games. Games using IMF music include:  Bio Menace ,  Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold ,  Blake Stone: Planet Strike ,  Catacomb 3-D ,  Commander Keen  4-6 ,  Corridor 7 ,  Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure ,  Duke Nukem II ,  Major Stryker ,  Monster Bash ,  Operation Body Count ,  Spear of Destiny , and  Wolfenstein 3D . \n See also [ edit ] \n AdLib \n Musical Instrument Digital Interface  (MIDI) \n Audio file format \n External links [ edit ] \n AdPlug , library that supports the IMF file format \n IMF Format at ModdingWiki , including detailed information on the format \n AdPlug Decoder add-on  for  Foobar2000 \n v \n t \n e \n Video game music \n Composers \n Japanese \n Takeshi Abo \n Yoshino Aoki \n Kenichiro Fukui \n Masashi Hamauzu \n Miki Higashino \n Wataru Hokoyama \n Shinji Hosoe \n Kenji Ito \n Noriyuki Iwadare \n Akari Kaida \n Hiroshi Kawaguchi \n Motohiro Kawashima \n Hiroki Kikuta \n Koji Kondo \n Yuzo Koshiro \n Jun Maeda \n Junichi Masuda \n Manami Matsumae \n Shoji Meguro \n Yasunori Mitsuda \n Takenobu Mitsuyoshi \n Yuu Miyake \n Masato Nakamura \n Junya Nakano \n Manabu Namiki \n Michiko Naruke \n Hitoshi Sakimoto \n Motoi Sakuraba \n Nobuyoshi Sano \n Tsuyoshi Sekito \n Yoko Shimomura \n Koichi Sugiyama \n Keiichi Suzuki \n Masafumi Takada \n Hirokazu Tanaka \n Kazumi Totaka \n Nobuo Uematsu \n Ryu Umemoto \n Ippo Yamada \n Michiru Yamane \n Akira Yamaoka \n Kinuyo Yamashita \n Kenji Yamazaki \n Western \n Clint Bajakian \n Danny Baranowsky \n Michiel van den Bos \n Alexander Brandon \n Bill Brown \n Ben Daglish \n Rom Di Prisco \n Eveline Fischer \n Tim Follin \n Dan Gardop\u00e9e \n Michael Giacchino \n Mick Gordon \n Jason Graves \n Peter Hajba \n James Hannigan \n Rob Hubbard \n Chris Huelsbeck \n Richard Jacques \n Jake Kaufman \n Grant Kirkhope \n Frank Klepacki \n Darren Korb \n Jesper Kyd \n Michael Land \n Peter McConnell \n Spencer Nilsen \n Graeme Norgate \n Martin O'Donnell \n Bobby Prince \n Winifred Phillips \n Marcin Przyby\u0142owicz \n Kevin Riepl \n George Sanger \n Garry Schyman \n Andrew Sega \n Jeremy Soule \n Tommy Tallarico \n Chance Thomas \n Jonne Valtonen \n Jack Wall \n David Wise \n Austin Wintory \n Inon Zur \n Sound teams \nand bands \n Alph Lyla \n The Black Mages \n Earthbound Papas \n Gamadelic \n Konami Kukeiha Club \n SoundTeMP \n S.S.T.
