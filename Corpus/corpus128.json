If the time interval is too\n                        short, and there is no way to turn auto-refresh off, people who are blind will not have enough time to make their screen\n                        readers read the page before the page refreshes unexpectedly and causes the\n                        screen reader to begin reading at the top. Sighted users may also be\n                        disoriented by the unexpected refresh. Examples \n\t\t\t\t\tFailure Example 1  This is a deprecated example that changes the user's page at regular\n                                intervals. Content developers should not use this technique to\n                                simulate \"push\" technology. Developers cannot predict how much time\n                                a user will require to read a page; premature refresh can disorient\n                                users. Content developers should avoid periodic refresh and allow\n                                users to choose when they want the latest information. (The number\n                                in the  content  attribute is the refresh interval in\n                                seconds.) Example Code: \n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"en\">\n  <head>     \n    <title>HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0</title>     \n    <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"60\" />   \n  </head>   \n  <body>\n    ...     \n  </body> \n</html>\n Related Techniques (none currently listed) Tests Procedure  Find  meta  elements in the document.  For each  meta  element, check if it contains\n               the  http-equiv  attribute with value \"refresh\" (case-insensitive) and\n               the  content  attribute with a number (representing seconds) equals to or greater than 0 and without \"; url=\" (case-insensitive).  check to see if there is a mechanism to turn off the refresh.  Expected Results If step 2 is true and step 3 is false then this failure condition applies and content\n                                    fails these Success Criteria.
