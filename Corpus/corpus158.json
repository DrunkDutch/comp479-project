In the privacy of this appointment, the student will be asked to provide a valid ID and sign a \u201cRequest to use Preferred Name\u201d form. A new Student ID card will be created at the  Birks Student Service Centre , which will notify the student for pick-up when it is ready. The preferred name will then be used on all unofficial documents in the future. \n Connect with us \n Office of the Registrar \n Related Resources \n Guidelines for the acceptable use of names, date of birth and sex \n Transcript requests \n Student record \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
