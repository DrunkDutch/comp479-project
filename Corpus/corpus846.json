Rakocy on September 11, 2017 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase A knock your socks off movie worth owning and reflecting upon.I especially like how the \"Johnny Depp\" Character was hidden in plain sight throughout the film. I.E.....he is a C.I.A. operator in Mexico wearing a C.I.A.-shirt, as well as a few other things he does. Read more 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?

Yes No Report abuse 4.0 out of 5 stars Great movie but soundtrack lacking By Stephanie Donald on February 6, 2013 Format: MP3 Music | Verified Purchase This is perhaps the crown jewel in Robert Rodriguez's \"garage studio\" productions and while the script of the movie and the acting staff is wonderful, the majority of the soundtrack is where you see how he cut money. Most of the tracks were things he wrote in his garage and the wonderful, rich sound he accomplished that enriched the drama, comedy and romance of \"Desperado\" is so obviously missing from this movie with the exception of just a few places and while I say that Robert Rodriguez's own themes aren't bad, they simply don't compare with Dire Straits, Los Lobos, Tito & Tarantula and Link Wray so prominently featured in the Desperado soundtrack. But that doesn't mean it still isn't worth owning. The music still causes me to remember key parts of the movie such as Johnny Depp playing \"fast draw\" with two of Marguez's men with no eyes and using his ears alone. Not a bad trick for someone who was born blind let alone someone who just lost his sight! It's what I cal an above average soundtrack but not one you should stampede to buy like Desperado!
