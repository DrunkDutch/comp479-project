There are two program options in the master's degree: Master of/ Magisteriate in Arts with thesis and Master of/Magisteriate in Arts with research papers. The Department has strong links with, and active participation in the Special Individualized Program (SIP) Ph.D. and the Humanities Ph.D. programs. For more information, you can also consult the  online  Theological Studies Graduate Calendar. \n Program Objectives \n The program is structured to enable students to apply contemporary methods of research to theological questions so as to arrive at valid personal knowledge. \n Option A:  the program is centred on the preparation of a substantial thesis. It will be most useful to students who already have a rich background in Theological Studies, and who already have developed an area of special interest in Theology, perhaps with a view to eventual doctoral studies. \n Option B:  is intended to provide students with an opportunity to widen their knowledge of theological areas (i.e. Scripture, History, Systematic Theology, Ethics), while at the same time learning the discipline of research in two shorter research projects. \n Masters (MA) \n How to apply \n Current students \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Programs \n Services \n Department Life \n News & Events \n Contact us \n Sir George William Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map \n Annex D \n2140 Rue Bishop \nMontr\u00e9al, QC H3G 2E9 \n See building map \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
