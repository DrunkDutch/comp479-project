He was the  bishop  of  Hippo Regius  in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important  Church Fathers  in Western Christianity for his writings in the  Patristic Era . Among his most important works are  The City of God  and  Confessions . \n According to his contemporary,  Jerome , Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith.\" [note 1]  In his early years, he was influenced by  Manichaeism  and afterward by the  neo-Platonism  of  Plotinus . After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives. [3]  Believing that the  grace of Christ  was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of  original sin  and made seminal contributions to the development of  just war theory . When the  Western Roman Empire  began to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual  City of God , distinct from the material Earthly City. [4]  His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. The segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the  Trinity  as defined by the  Council of Nicaea  and the  Council of Constantinople   [5]  closely identified with Augustine's  On the Trinity . \n Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Christian Church, and the  Anglican Communion  and as a preeminent  Doctor of the Church . He is also the patron of the  Augustinians . His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. Augustine is the  patron saint  of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses. [6]  Many  Protestants , especially  Calvinists  and  Lutherans , consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the  Protestant Reformation  due to his teachings on  salvation  and  divine grace . [7] [8] [9]  Lutherans, and  Martin Luther  in particular, have held Augustine in preeminence (after the Bible and St. Paul). Luther himself was a member of the  Order of the Augustinian Eremites  (1505\u20131521). \n In the  East , some of his teachings are disputed and have in the 20th century in particular come under attack by such theologians as  John Romanides . [10]  But other theologians and figures of the  Eastern Orthodox Church  have shown significant appropriation of his writings, chiefly  Georges Florovsky . [11]  The most controversial doctrine surrounding his name is the  filioque , [12]  which has been rejected by the Orthodox Church. [13]  Other disputed teachings include his views on original sin, the doctrine of grace, and  predestination . [12]  Nevertheless, though considered to be mistaken on some points, he is still considered a saint, and has even had influence on some Eastern  Church Fathers , most notably  Saint Gregory Palamas . [14]  In the Orthodox Church his feast day is celebrated on 15 June. [12] [15]  Church scholar and historian  Diarmaid MacCulloch  writes \"his impact on Western Christian thought can hardly be overstated; only his beloved example  Paul of Tarsus , has been more influential, and Westerners have generally seen Paul through Augustine's eyes.\" [16] \n Contents \n 1   Life \n 1.1   Background \n 1.2   Childhood and education \n 1.3   Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan \n 1.4   Christian conversion and priesthood \n 1.5   Death and veneration \n 1.5.1   Relics \n 2   Views and thought \n 2.1   Theology \n 2.1.1   Christian anthropology \n 2.1.2   Creation \n 2.1.3   Ecclesiology \n 2.1.4   Eschatology \n 2.1.5   Mariology \n 2.1.6   Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation \n 2.1.7   Original sin \n 2.1.8   Predestination \n 2.1.9   Sacramental theology \n 2.2   Philosophy \n 2.2.1   Astrology \n 2.2.2   Epistemology \n 2.2.3   Just war \n 2.2.4   Free will \n 2.3   Sociology, morals and ethics \n 2.3.1   Slavery \n 2.3.2   Jews \n 2.3.3   Sexuality \n 2.3.4   Pedagogy \n 3   Works \n 4   Influence \n 4.1   In philosophy \n 4.2   In theology \n 4.3   Oratorio \n 5   See also \n 6   References \n 6.1   Notes \n 6.2   Sources \n 6.3   Further reading \n 7   External links \n 7.1   General \n 7.2   Bibliography \n 7.3   Works by Augustine \n 7.4   Biography and criticism \n Life [ edit ] \n Background [ edit ] \n Augustine of Hippo ( / \u0254\u02d0 \u02c8 \u0261 \u028c s t \u026a n / , [1]   / \u0259 \u02c8 \u0261 \u028c s t \u026a n / , [17]  or  / \u02c8 \u0254\u02d0 \u0261 \u028c s t \u026a n / ; [18]   Latin :  Aurelius Augustinus Hipponensis ; [note 2]  13 November 354 \u2013 28 August 430), also known as  Saint Augustine ,  Saint Austin , [19]  ( / \u02c8 \u0254\u02d0 s t \u026a n /  or  / \u02c8 \u0251\u02d0 s t \u026a n / ), [20]  is known by various cognomens throughout the Christian world across its many denominations including  Blessed Augustine , [21]  and the  Doctor of Grace [22]  ( Latin :  Doctor gratiae ) \n Hippo Regius , where Augustine was the  bishop , was in modern-day  Annaba ,  Algeria , located in  Numidia  ( Roman province of Africa ). \n Childhood and education [ edit ] \n The Saint Augustine Taken to School by Saint Monica.  by  Niccol\u00f2 di Pietro  1413\u201315 \n Augustine was born in the year 354 AD in the  municipium  of Thagaste (now  Souk Ahras ,  Algeria ) in  Roman Africa . [23] [24]  His mother,  Monica  or  Monnica , [25]  was a devout Christian; his father Patricius was a Pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed. [26]  Scholars generally agree that Augustine and his family were  Berbers , an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa, [27] [28] [29] [30]  but that they were heavily Romanized, speaking only Latin at home as a matter of pride and dignity. [27]  In his writings, Augustine leaves some information as to the consciousness of his African heritage. For example, he refers to  Apuleius  as \"the most notorious of us Africans,\" [31]  to Ponticianus as \"a country man of ours, insofar as being African,\" [32]  and to  Faustus of Mileve  as \"an African  Gentleman .\" [33] \n Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were  freedmen  of the  gens Aurelia  given full Roman citizenship by the  Edict of Caracalla  in 212. Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born. [34]  It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of  Berber  origin, on the basis of her name, [35] [36]  but as his family were  honestiores , an upper class of citizens known as honorable men, Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin. [35] \n At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now  M'Daourouch ), a small  Numidian  city about 19 miles (31\u00a0km) south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with  Latin literature , as well as pagan beliefs and practices. [37]  His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography,  The Confessions . He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because he was hungry, but because \"it was not permitted.\" [38]  His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error\u2014not that for which I erred, but the error itself.\" [38]  From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ. \n At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus, [39]  Augustine went to  Carthage  to continue his education in  rhetoric . It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read  Cicero 's  dialogue   Hortensius  (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression and sparking his interest in philosophy. [40]  Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the  Manichaean religion , much to his mother's despair. [41]  As a youth Augustine lived a  hedonistic  lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits. The need to gain their acceptance forced inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences. [42]  It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, \"Grant me  chastity  and  continence , but not yet.\" [43] \n At about the age of 19, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover [44]  for over fifteen years [45]  and gave birth to his son Adeodatus, [46]  who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest. [45] [47] \n Augustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek [48] \u2014he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points. \n Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan [ edit ] \nThe earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome \n Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years. [39]  Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay. \n Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome,  Symmachus , who while traveling through Carthage had been asked by the imperial court at  Milan [49]  to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers. \n Although Augustine showed some fervour for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or \"elect\", but an \"auditor\", the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy. [49]  While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop,  Faustus of Mileve , a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism. [49]  In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the  scepticism  of the  New Academy  movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths. [50]  At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in  Neoplatonism , and his friend  Simplicianus  all urged him towards Christianity. [39]  Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with  Ambrose  of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed. \n Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced. [51]  Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. Augustine arrived in Milan and was immediately taken under the wing by Ambrose. Within his  Confessions , Augustine states, \"That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should.\" [52] \n Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, \"And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church\u2014but as a friendly man.\" [52]  Augustine visited Ambrose in order to see if Ambrose was one of the greatest speakers and rhetoricians in the world. More interested in his speaking skills than the topic of speech, Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity. [52] \n Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a marriage for him. Although Augustine accepted this marriage, for which he had to abandon his concubine, he was deeply hurt by the loss of his lover. He wrote, \"My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding.\" Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fianc\u00e9e came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed, even began to fester. [53] \n There is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage. [54]  In his  Confessions , he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fianc\u00e9e, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines.  Alypius of Thagaste  steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at  Cassiciacum , a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as  Christianae vitae otium  \u2013 the Christian life of leisure. [55] \n Christian conversion and priesthood [ edit ] \n The Conversion of St. Augustine  by  Fra Angelico . [56] \n In late August of 386, [57]  at the age of 31, after having heard and been inspired and moved by the story of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of  Saint Anthony of the Desert , Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to \"take up and read\" ( Latin :  tolle, lege ), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. Augustine read from  Paul's Epistle to the Romans  \u2013 the \" Transformation of Believers \" section, consisting of chapters 12 to 15 \u2013 wherein Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers, and the believers' resulting behaviour. The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit: \n Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof. [58] \n He later wrote an account of his conversion \u2013 his very transformation, as Paul described \u2013 in his  Confessions  ( Latin :  Confessiones ), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of  autobiography . This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the  Confessions  also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics. [59]  The following is taken from that work: \n Late have I loved Thee, O Lord; and behold, \nThou wast within and I without, and there I sought Thee. \nThou was with me when I was not with Thee. \nThou didst call, and cry, and burst my deafness. \nThou didst gleam, and glow, and dispell my blindness. \nThou didst touch me, and I burned for Thy peace. \nFor Thyself Thou hast made us, \nAnd restless our hearts until in Thee they find their ease. \nLate have I loved Thee, Thou Beauty ever old and ever new. [59] \n Ambrose  baptized Augustine, along with his son Adeodatus, in Milan on  Easter Vigil , April 24\u201325, 387. [60]  A year later, in 388, Augustine completed his  apology   On the Holiness of the Catholic Church . [49]  That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa. [39]  Augustine's mother Monica died at  Ostia , Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. [61]  Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property. [62] [63]  Soon after, Adeodatus, too, died. [64]  Augustine then sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a  monastic  foundation for himself and a group of friends. [39] \n In 391 Augustine was  ordained  a  priest  in  Hippo Regius  (now  Annaba ), in  Algeria . He became a famous  preacher  (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered. [49] \n In 395, he was made  coadjutor Bishop  of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter, [65]  hence the name \"Augustine of Hippo\"; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste. [66]  He remained in that position until his death in 430. He wrote his autobiographical  Confessions  in 397\u2013398. His work  The City of God  was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the  Visigoths  had  sacked Rome in 410 . \n Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a  regula  for his monastery that led to his designation as the \" patron saint  of  regular clergy .\" [67] \n Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend  Possidius , bishop of  Calama  (present-day  Guelma , Algeria), in his  Sancti Augustini Vita . Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see. [68] \n Death and veneration [ edit ] \n Shortly before Augustine's death the  Vandals , a  Germanic  tribe that had converted to  Arianism , invaded  Roman Africa . The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege. [68] : 43  According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential  Psalms of David  be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430. [68] : 57  Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched. [69] \n Augustine was  canonized  by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by  Pope Boniface VIII . [70]  His  feast day  is 28 August, the day on which he died. He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses. [6] \n Relics [ edit ] \n According to  Bede 's  True Martyrology , Augustine's body was later  translated  or moved to  Cagliari ,  Sardinia , by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by  Huneric . Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter,  bishop of Pavia  and uncle of the Lombard king  Liutprand , to the church of  San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro  in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by  Muslims . In January 1327,  Pope John XXII  issued the papal bull  Veneranda Santorum Patrum , in which he appointed the  Augustinians  guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called  Arca ), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life. \n In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the  regular canons  (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually  Pope Benedict XIII  (1724\u20131730) directed the Bishop of Pavia,  Monsignor  Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Saint Augustine. [71] \n The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in  Milan  with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled  Arca , which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair, but was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of  Agostino Gaetano Riboldi , and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.

Along with John Chrysostom, Augustine was among the most prolific scholars of the early church by quantity of surviving writings. \n Theology [ edit ] \n Christian anthropology [ edit ] \n Augustine was one of the first Christian  ancient Latin  authors with a very clear vision of  theological anthropology . [74]  He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise  On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5  (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human  person . [75]  Augustine's favourite figure to describe  body-soul  unity is marriage:  caro tua, coniunx tua \u2013 your body is your wife . [76] [77] [78] \n Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the  fall of humanity  they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions. [79]  Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body. [80] \n Augustine was not preoccupied, as  Plato  and  Descartes  were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the  metaphysics  of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason. [81] [82] \n Like other Church Fathers such as  Athenagoras , [83]   Tertullian , [84]   Clement of Alexandria  and  Basil of Caesarea , [85]  Augustine \"vigorously condemned the practice of induced  abortion \", and although he disapproved of an abortion during any stage of pregnancy, he made a distinction between early abortions and later ones. [86]  He acknowledged the distinction between \"formed\" and \"unformed\" fetuses mentioned in the  Septuagint  translation of  Exodus 21:22\u201323 , which is considered as wrong translation of the word \"harm\" from the original Hebrew text as \"form\" in the Greek Septuagint and based in Aristotelian distinction \"between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'\", and did not classify as murder the abortion of an \"unformed\" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul. [86] [87] \n Augustine held that \"the timing of the infusion of the soul was a mystery known to God alone\". [88]  However, he considered procreation as one of the goods of marriage; abortion figured as a means, along with drugs which cause sterility, of frustrating this good. It lay along a continuum which included infanticide as an instance of \u2018lustful cruelty\u2019 or \u2018cruel lust.\u2019 Augustine called the use of means to avoid the birth of a child an \u2018evil work:\u2019 a reference to either abortion or contraception or both.\" [89] \n Creation [ edit ] \n See also:  Allegorical interpretations of Genesis \n In  City of God , Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings. [90]  In  The Literal Interpretation of Genesis , Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a literal interpretation of  Genesis  would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a  logical framework , rather than the passage of time in a physical way \u2013 it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in  Sirach  18:1,  creavit omnia simul  (\"He created all things at once\"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally. [91] \n Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of  Adam and Eve  were already created mortal before  the Fall . [92]  Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up. [93] \n Ecclesiology [ edit ] \n See also:  Ecclesiology \n St. Augustine  by  Carlo Crivelli \n Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the  Donatist  sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional  hierarchy , the  Catholic sacraments , and the  laity ) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the  sacraments , while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of \"wheat\" and \"tares\", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a  state of grace  were the \"true\" or \"pure\" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments. [8] : 28 \n Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in  City of God . There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed  Cyprian  in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the  successors of the Apostles , [8]  and that their authority in the Church is God-given. \n Eschatology [ edit ] \n Augustine originally believed in  premillennialism , namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general  resurrection , but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of  amillennialism , although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern  postmillennialists . The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church. [94] \n During the  Reformation  theologians such as  John Calvin  accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death, [95] [96]  and that  purgatorial  fires of the  intermediate state  purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology. [95] \n Mariology [ edit ] \n Although Augustine did not develop an independent  Mariology , his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. [97]  Even before the  Council of Ephesus , he defended the  Ever-Virgin Mary  as the  Mother of God , believing her to be \"full of grace\" (following earlier Latin writers such as  Jerome ) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence. [98]  Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary \"conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever.\" [99] \n Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation [ edit ] \n Augustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this \"literal sense\" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended  metaphor . [100] \n Original sin [ edit ] \n See also:  Original sin \nPortrait by  Philippe de Champaigne , 17th century \n Augustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness ( insipientia ) followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first. [note 3]  The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the  Tree of the knowledge of good and evil  (Gen 2:17). [101]  The tree was a symbol of the order of creation. [102]  Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values. [note 4] \n They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if  Satan  hadn't sown into their senses \"the root of evil\" ( radix Mali ). [103]  Their nature was wounded by  concupiscence  or  libido , which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire. [note 5]  In terms of  metaphysics , concupiscence is not a being but bad quality, the privation of good or a wound. [104] \n Augustine's understanding of the consequences of original sin and the necessity of redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against  Pelagius  and his  Pelagian  disciples,  Caelestius  and  Julian of Eclanum , [8]  who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of  Theodore of Mopsuestia . [105]  They refused to agree that original sin wounded human will and mind, insisting that the human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it. [106] : 355\u2013356 [107] \n Like  Jovinian , Pelagians insisted that human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality,  e.g.   fornication , is exclusively a matter of will,  i.e.  a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God. [108] \n Augustine had served as a \"Hearer\" for the Manichaeans for about nine years, [109]  who taught that the original sin was  carnal knowledge . [110]  But his struggle to understand the cause of evil in the world started before that, at the age of nineteen. [111]  By  malum  (evil) he understood most of all  concupiscence , which he interpreted as a vice dominating person and causing in men and women moral disorder. Agostino Trap\u00e8 insists that Augustine's personal experience cannot be credited for his doctrine about concupiscence. He considers Augustine's marital experience to be quite normal, and even exemplary, aside from the absence of Christian wedding rites. [112]  As J. Brachtendorf showed, Augustine used Ciceronian  Stoic  concept of passions, to interpret  Paul's  doctrine of universal sin and redemption. [113] \n St. Augustine  by  Peter Paul Rubens \n The view that not only human  soul  but also senses were influenced by the fall of Adam and Eve was prevalent in Augustine's time among the  Fathers of the Church . [114]  It is clear that the reason for Augustine's distancing from the affairs of the flesh was different from that of  Plotinus , a neo-Platonist [note 6]  who taught that only through disdain for fleshly desire could one reach the ultimate state of mankind. [115]  Augustine taught the redemption, i.e. transformation and purification, of the body in the resurrection. [116] \n Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against  human sexuality  and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the  Confessions . But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding. [106] : 312 [note 7]  Augustine taught that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires  redemption  of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a  remedium concupiscentiae  \u2013 remedy of concupiscence. [117] [118]  The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body. [119] \n The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by  concupiscence , [120]  which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body, [note 8]  making humanity a  massa damnata  (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will. [95] : 1200\u20131204 \n Augustine's formulation of the doctrine of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils,  i.e.   Carthage (418) ,  Ephesus  (431),  Orange  (529),  Trent  (1546) and by popes,  i.e.   Pope Innocent I  (401\u2013417) and  Pope Zosimus  (417\u2013418).  Anselm of Canterbury  established in his  Cur Deus Homo  the definition that was followed by the great 13th-century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the \"privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess\", thus separating it from  concupiscence , with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it [106] : 371 [121]  as later did Luther and Calvin. [95] : 1200\u20131204  In 1567,  Pope Pius V  condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence. [95] : 1200\u20131204 \n Predestination [ edit ] \n See also:  Predestination \n Augustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom. [122] : 44  Prior to 396, he believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was \"a reward for human assent\". [122] : 48\u201349  Later, in response to  Pelagius , Augustine said that the sin of  pride  consists in assuming that \"we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us\", and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith. [122] : 47\u201348 \n Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies  double predestination , or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars have held that Augustine did believe in double predestination. [123]  Some Protestant theologians, such as  Justo L. Gonz\u00e1lez [8] : 44  and  Bengt H\u00e4gglund , [7]  interpret Augustine's teaching that grace is  irresistible , results in conversion, and leads to  perseverance . \n In  On Rebuke and Grace  ( De correptione et gratia ), Augustine wrote: \"And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.\" [9] \n Sacramental theology [ edit ] \n St. Augustine in His Study  by  Vittore Carpaccio , 1502 \n Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the \"regularity\" and \"validity\" of the  sacraments . Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them ( ex opere operato ); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of  Cyprian , who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised. [8]  Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church. \n Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the  real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , saying that Christ's statement, \"This is my body\" referred to the bread he carried in his hands, [124] [125]  and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes. [126] \n Against the  Pelagians , Augustine strongly stressed the importance of  infant baptism . About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved. [127]  This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his  City of God , concerning the  Apocalypse , may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents. [128] \n Philosophy [ edit ] \n Astrology [ edit ] \n Augustine's contemporaries often believed  astrology  to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called  mathemathici . Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and  horoscopes . (Augustine's term \"mathematici\", meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as \"mathematicians\".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of  Hipparchus  or  Eratosthenes  but \"common swindlers\". [129] [106] : 63 [130] [131] \n Epistemology [ edit ] \n Epistemological  concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [ Contra academicos  (386) and  De Magistro  (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of  divine illumination . The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of  sense perception . It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities. [2] \n Augustine also posed the  problem of other minds  throughout different works, most famously perhaps in  On the Trinity  (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds. [132]  In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of  testimony  to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports. [133] \n Just war [ edit ] \n See also:  Just war theory \n Augustine asserted that Christians should be  pacifists  as a personal, philosophical stance. [134]  However, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defence of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine coined the phrase in his work  The City of God . [135]  In essence, the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting for its long-term preservation. [136]  Such a war could not be pre-emptive, but defensive, to restore peace. [137]   Thomas Aquinas , centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just. [138] [139] \n Free will [ edit ] \n Included in Augustine's  theodicy  is the claim that God created humans and angels as rational beings possessing  free will . Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as \"free\" as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin's corruption. [140] \n The  Catholic Church  considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will. [141]  He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish. [141]  While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies. [141] \n Sociology, morals and ethics [ edit ] \n Slavery [ edit ] \n Augustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves \"as an act of piety.\" [142]  He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing  infanticide  when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival. [143] \n In his book,  The City of God , he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God \"did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation \u2013 not man over man, but man over the beasts.\" Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. \"The condition of slavery is the result of sin\", he declared. [144]  In  The City of God , Augustine wrote he felt slavery was not a punishment. He wrote: \"Slavery is not penal in character and planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids disturbance.\" \n Jews [ edit ] \n Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of  Hebrew Scripture , Augustine countered that God had chosen the  Jews  as a special people, [145]  and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy. [146]  He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely \"Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law\" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at \"the end of time\", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands. [147]  The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews \"survive but not thrive\" (it is repeated by author  James Carroll  in his book  Constantine's Sword , for example) [148] [149]  is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings. [150] \n Sexuality [ edit ] \n For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In  On Christian Doctrine  Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God. [151]  Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse ( On marriage and concupiscence  1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil ( On marriage and concupiscence  1.27;  A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians  2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the \"better\" way ( Confessions  8.2) and abstain from marriage ( On marriage and concupiscence  1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act. [152] [153] \n Before the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, \"just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat\"; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse \"simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence\" ( On marriage and concupiscence  2.29; cf.  City of God  14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: \"Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also\" ( City of God  14.16). \n Augustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam. [154] [155]  Accordingly, Augustine did not believe that Adam was any less guilty of sin. [154] [156]  Augustine does praise women and their role in society and in the Church. In his  Tractates on the Gospel of John , Augustine, commenting on the  Samaritan  woman from John 4:1\u201342, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. \"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"  [157] \n Pedagogy [ edit ] \n Saint Augustine in His Study  by  Sandro Botticelli , 1494,  Uffizi Gallery \n Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is  De Magistro  (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his  Retractationes , reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of \"retractationes\" may be \"reconsiderations\". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change. [158] \n Augustine was a strong advocate of  critical thinking  skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Saint Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners. [158] \n He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds: \n the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers; \n the student who has had no education; and \n the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated. \n If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between \"having words and having understanding\" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge. \n Under the influence of  Bede ,  Alcuin , and  Rabanus Maurus ,  De catechizandis rudibus  came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards. [159] \n Augustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The  mixed style  includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The  grand style  is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional  Bible -based practice of strict discipline. \n Works [ edit ] \n Main article:  Augustine of Hippo bibliography \n Saint Augustine  painting by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez \n Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles. [160]  They include  apologetic  works against the heresies of the  Arians ,  Donatists ,  Manichaeans  and  Pelagians ; texts on Christian  doctrine , notably  De Doctrina Christiana  ( On Christian Doctrine );  exegetical  works such as commentaries on  Genesis , the  Psalms  and  Paul's   Letter to the Romans ; many  sermons  and  letters ; and the  Retractationes , a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life. \n Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his  Confessions , which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for  De civitate Dei  ( The City of God , consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the  sack of Rome  by the  Visigoths  in 410. His  On the Trinity , in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the  Trinity , is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. [ citation needed ]  He also wrote  On Free Choice of the Will  ( De libero arbitrio ), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil. \n Influence [ edit ] \n Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics  painting by Verges Group \n In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by  Stoicism ,  Platonism  and  Neoplatonism , particularly by the work of  Plotinus , author of the  Enneads , probably through the mediation of  Porphyry  and  Victorinus  (as  Pierre Hadot  has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism, some ideas are still visible in his early writings. [161]  His early and influential writing on the  human will , a central topic in  ethics , would become a focus for later philosophers such as  Schopenhauer ,  Kierkegaard , and  Nietzsche . He was also influenced by the works of  Virgil  (known for his teaching on language), and  Cicero  (known for his teaching on argument). [2] \n In philosophy [ edit ] \n Philosopher   Bertrand Russell  was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the  Confessions , comparing it favourably to  Kant 's version of the view that time is subjective. [162]  Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists  outside of time  in the \"eternal present\"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of  memory .  Frances Yates  in her 1966 study  The Art of Memory  argues that a brief passage of the  Confessions , 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory [163]  clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a  mnemonic  technique for organizing large amounts of information. \n Saint Augustine Meditates on the Trinity when the Child Jesus Appears before him  by Verg\u00f3s Group \n Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his  Confessions , had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern  phenomenology  and  hermeneutics . [164]   Edmund Husserl  writes: \"The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.\" [165] \n Martin Heidegger  refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work  Being and Time . [note 9]   Hannah Arendt  began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love,  Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin  (1929): \"The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for  vita socialis  in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.\" [166] \n Jean Bethke Elshtain in  Augustine and the Limits of Politics  tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: \"Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced  the Holocaust  as merely banal [in  Eichmann in Jerusalem ].\" [167] \n Augustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian political theology; and third, Augustinian political theory. [168] \n In theology [ edit ] \n Thomas Aquinas  was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without \"supernatural gifts\". [95] : 1203  While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see  total depravity ). [95] : 1200\u20131204 \n According to  Leo Ruickbie , Augustine's arguments against  magic , differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against  paganism  and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and  witchcraft . According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the  Enlightenment ,  Marxism ,  Freudianism  and eco-fundamentalism. [169]  Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly  The City of God , in their book of political philosophy  Empire . \n Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as  John Piper .  Hannah Arendt , an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career.  Ludwig Wittgenstein  extensively quotes Augustine in  Philosophical Investigations  for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the  Confessions . Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of  Ferdinand de Saussure , who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of  semiotics , but rather built upon  Aristotelian  and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: \"as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies.\" [170] \n In his autobiographical book  Milestones ,  Pope Benedict XVI  claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought. \n Oratorio [ edit ] \n The Consecration of Saint Augustine  by  Jaume Huguet \n Much of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in the oratorio  La conversione di Sant'Agostino  (1750) composed by  Johann Adolph Hasse . The libretto for this oratorio, written by  Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria , draws upon the influence of  Metastasio  (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based off an earlier five-act play  Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus  written by the Jesuit priest  Franz Neumayr . [171]  In the libretto Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity. As Dr. Andrea Palent [172]  says: \n Maria Antonia Walpurgis revised the five-part Jesuit drama into a two-part oratorio liberty in which she limits the subject to the conversion of Augustine and his submission to the will of God. To this was added the figure of the mother, Monica, so as to let the transformation appear by experience rather than the dramatic artifice of deus ex machina. \n Throughout the oratorio Augustine shows his willingness to turn to God, but the burden of the act of conversion weighs heavily on him. This is displayed by Hasse through extended recitative passages. \n See also [ edit ] \n Saints portal \n Alexander of San Elpidio \n Mar Ammo \n Augustinian hypothesis \n Augustinian Institute \n Augustinian Studies \n Augustinian theodicy \n Augustinians \n Domingo Ba\u00f1ez \n Thomas Bradwardine \n Confessions  (Augustine) \n Constantinian shift \n Council of Orange (529) \n Ecclesiology \n Jonathan Edwards \n Filioque \n Free will \n Gregory of Rimini \n Michael Horton \n Incurvatus in se \n Cornelius Jansen \n Jansenism \n Just war theory \n Johannes Klenkok \n Abraham Kuijper \n John Gresham Machen \n Order of Saint Augustine \n Original sin \n Otium \n Neo-Calvinism \n Blaise Pascal \n Francis Landey Patton \n Pelagianism \n Philosophy of history \n Philosophy of religion \n Predestination \n Johann Pupper \n Problem of evil \n Reformed \n Scholasticism \n Semipelagianism \n Theology of John Calvin \n Truth \n Bennet Tyler \n B.

( Contra Julianum , V, 4.18;  PL  44, 795) \n ^   Augustine explained it in this way: \"Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more.\" (\" On the Trinity \" ( De Trinitate ), 5:7;  CCL  50, 320 [1\u201312]) \n ^   In one of Augustine's late works,  Retractationes , he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: \"Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido\" (\"libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis\"). See the whole passage:  Dixi etiam quodam loco: \u00abQuod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest\u00bb. Quod ideo dictum est, quoniam \"libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis\". Sicut enim malum est male uti bonis, ita bonum bene uti malis. De qua re alias, maxime contra novos haereticos Pelagianos, diligentius disputavi . Cf.

Clarke SJ writes:  Towards Neoplatonism there was throughout his life a decidedly ambivalent attitude; one must expect both agreement and sharp dissent, derivation but also repudiation. In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul. The disagreement chiefly concerned, as we have said, two related and central Christian dogmas: the Incarnation of the Son of God and the resurrection of the flesh .  Clarke,  SJ , T.

Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal.  (\" On the Sermon on the Mount \",  De sermone Domini in monte , 1:16:46;  CCL  35, 52) \n ^   For example, Heidegger's articulations of how \"Being-in-the-world\" is described through thinking about  seeing : \"The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of  concupiscentia .\" Heidegger then quotes the Confessions : \"Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'\".
