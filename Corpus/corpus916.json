Soon after moving in, Janet inexplicably dies, falling out the window of her thirteenth story apartment. Her sister Lana (Mischa Barton) moves in to the apartment, determined to reveal the truth behind her siblings bizarre death. What Lana finds is far more frightening and unexplainable than she had thought possible. Before she knows it, Lana gets pulled into a cycle of supernatural horror as she struggles to escape the apartment before she becomes its next victim.\n Product details \n   Actors:   Mischa Barton ,  Rebecca De Mornay ,  Julianne Michelle ,  Corey Sevier ,  John Diehl \n   Directors:   Michele Taverna \n   Format:  Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Surround Sound, Widescreen \n Language:  English \n   Region:  Region 1 ( U.S. and Canada only.

I'm in to the movie about 20 minutes and I'm regretting my selection and considering ending the (my) torture but no, I continue to watch hoping against all hope that it will improve but it doesn't.  In fact, it continues the descent into what I've only seen a handful of times in my life - oh the agony, the utter and complete pain.  Let this review be your WARNING: Go to your next selection - don't waste your time here.  The story sucks, the acting sucks worse and the ghosts are absurd, horrible.  Please whoever you are please don't ever try to make a movie again. Read more 0 Comment | \n      147 people found this helpful.\n  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuse 1.0 out of 5 stars And I paid $9.99 to see this??? By Vicky on June 24, 2013 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase Wow, this for sure makes my top 10 list of all time lame movies!!  I was trying to figure out if it was the acting that was terrible or the screen writing because I guess an actor can't deliver a good line if there wasn't one in the script!  I felt almost embarrassed for this cast who tried to pull it off, especially Rebecca De Mornay, who is a normally a decent actress.  Her role was almost ridiculous and she seemed so ill-fit for that role.  I think probably the most ridiculous scene was Mischa (terrible in this role, btw) walking out in a tiny towel from a bath to find the creepy building manager who had let himself into her apartment just sitting there. She demands that he leaves, he doesn't and she says \"I need some water\". Right, a creepy could-be rapist in your place while you're in 1 yard of material and you need a glass of water??  That scene was almost painful to watch. But worse than the acting was the plot, which was flat and anticlimactic. I kept waiting for all of the mysteries to unfold and when the movie was over I was like \"Wait, is there more, this can't possibly be the ending can it??\"  SO stupid! And finally, in terms of horror flicks, or whatever this movie was trying to be, there are only so many scenes of a creepy girl standing in the corner or a creepy girl in the mirror.  They did that scene to death in this movie. I mean normally even in a great movie that scene does not evoke any fear, it's just a person standing in the corner, big deal, but in this movie it was like \"Oh look there is the ghost in the corner, and now look there she is standing there trying to look evil, and look now she's sitting on the railing oh and look, there she is in the mirror and then oh look, there she is in the corner again.\"  The point of a ghost, in my opinion, if to know of its presence, not have it visible in every scene. Bottom line, don't waste even a dime to watch this movie and if you can get it for free then just don't waste your time.

Kuchta on October 30, 2013 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase I love horror films, whether they are Slashers, psychological, suspense, monster, zombie, or what ever else Hollywood comes up with. I love the old ones, the new ones the grade A, B or C ones. This was NOT a horror flick. This stunk. I wanted to like it, really I did. After all it's about my hometown and birth place, Detroit. But I found nothing, absolutely nothing, to like about this film. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero stars. If you're looking for a good scary film, skip this one. Watch \"Night of the Living Dead\" again and count yourself lucky! Read more 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuse 1.0 out of 5 stars Awful By Leia Strand on August 20, 2013 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase There were 5 of us seated to watch this movie. 30 minutes into the movie there were 2 of us left and 15 minutes later, we turned it off, wishing for the past 45 minutes of our lives back. The $6.99 was a waste of money along with the time! By far, one of the worst movies I've seen. Read more 0 Comment | \n      6 people found this helpful.\n  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuse 2.0 out of 5 stars Oh no you didn't! By Fern Staton on July 21, 2013 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase I love a good scary movie and can tolerate a \"b\" scary movie but this movie, despite having paid nearly $10 to rent it, was beyond garbage. I'm sorry, but most of the acting was sub-standard: that boozy mom with her acoustic guitar swinging around in front of her: that \"What is that horrible smell\" question asked and answered over and over...I finally shut it off. I lied to my husband and told him it was a free download just because he would have killed me and put me in a closet like the victim in the movie if he knew I'd paid that much to rent it. Thank God I didn't buy it! It would have ended up in my garden, hanging from a string and scaring off birds, which is better than what it did for me. Scared? Hell no. Bored? You bet.

Yes No Report abuse 1.0 out of 5 stars Don't be fooled like me By Kindle Customer on July 25, 2013 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase This movie is ........  Fill in whatever word you want that describes awful.  I am unemployed, and think I have found my next job.  Screenwriter.  If this sells in Hollywood, I will never be out of work again.  The best part about this movie is that it is less than two hours long.  I am most grateful that I did not go to a theater to see this garbage. Nothing about this was mysterious, or remotely scarey. Amazon should give me a refund or a credit for watching this.  I feel cheated! Don't ever do this again please. On the positive side, if you buy the DVD, you can give it to that pesty neighbor or family member that always likes to borrow your movies and never returns them. There is a use for everything!

By Skuttle Bucket on November 15, 2013 Format: Amazon Video | Verified Purchase Holy cow! This has got to be the worst film ever created. I have seen some bad horror, but at least they were so bad that you could have a laugh. Nope- not with this one. The acting was incredibly shallow, no depth to the characters whatsoever.It is so terribly scripted that I have to wonder what idiot thought this would be a  brilliant idea to release it. I will look that up later just to put him (them) on my list of movies to AVOID. I only bothered to leave it streaming because I was to busy working on my art to give a damn. I actually stopped painting for a moment just to stop the ignorance echoing into my ear, then I scrolled to the end to see how badly it would finish off, and YUP- It sure was 100% crap from beginning to end. Fortunately I was smart enough to wait until it was free on Prime. Read more 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?
