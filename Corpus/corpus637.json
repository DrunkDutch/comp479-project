If I had been able to see Olivier's National Theatre at my local cinema, I would have gone all of the time. \n \u2014  Nicholas Hytner , director of the  Royal National Theatre . [1] \n The programme began its pilot season in June 2009 with a production of  Ph\u00e8dre , starring  Helen Mirren , which screened live in 70 cinemas across the UK. Two hundred more venues eventually showed the production internationally, resulting in a combined audience of around 50,000 people for this one performance. [2]  The second production,  All's Well That Ends Well , showed at a total of around 300 screens, [3]  and today, the number of venues that show NT Live productions has grown to around 700. [4] \n With the exception of a Saturday matinee for  Nation , a Monday evening showing for  London Assurance , and a Tuesday evening showing for  A Streetcar Named Desire , all National Theatre Live productions have been broadcast on a Thursday evening, to avoid conflicting with cinemas' weekend schedules. Most venues screen the productions live as they are broadcast, but because of the time differences in South Africa, Australia,  New Zealand , and the United States venues in those countries show the recorded production some days later. Many venues also offer repeat screenings of popular productions which they term 'Encores'. \n Most productions broadcast are plays performed in repertory at the  Royal National Theatre , but works by other companies have been included.  A Disappearing Number  by  Complicite  was broadcast live from the  Theatre Royal, Plymouth  on 14 October 2010. The  Donmar Warehouse 's production of  King Lear , starring  Derek Jacobi  was broadcast live from Covent Garden on 3 February 2011. In the summer of 2013, a broadcast of  Macbeth  starring  Kenneth Branagh  and  Alex Kingston  was broadcast live from the  Manchester International Festival  on 20 July 2013.  A Streetcar Named Desire  starring  Gillian Anderson  was broadcast live from the  Young Vic  on 16 September 2014. \n Live broadcasts [ edit ] \n Live performances are broadcast live from the National Theatre (unless noted). They are certified differently from feature films. \n Season 1 [ edit ] \n Phedre  \u2013 25 June 2009 \n All's Well That Ends Well  \u2013 1 October 2009 \n Nation  \u2013 30 January 2010 \n The Habit of Art  \u2013 22 April 2010 \n London Assurance  \u2013 28 June 2010 \n Season 2 [ edit ] \n A Disappearing Number  \u2013 14 October 2010 \n Hamlet  \u2013 9 December 2010 \n Fela!  \u2013 13 January 2011 \n King Lear  \u2013 3 February 2011 \n Frankenstein  \u2013 17 & 24 March 2011 \n The Cherry Orchard  \u2013 30 June 2011 \n Season 3 [ edit ] \n One Man, Two Guvnors  \u2013 15 September 2011 \n The Kitchen  \u2013 6 October 2011 \n Collaborators  \u2013 1 December 2011 \n Travelling Light  \u2013 9 February 2012 \n The Comedy of Errors  \u2013 1 March 2012 \n She Stoops to Conquer  \u2013 29 March 2012 \n Season 4 [ edit ] \n The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  \u2013 6 September 2012 \n The Last of the Haussmans  \u2013 11 October 2012 [5] \n Timon of Athens  \u2013 1 November 2012 [6] \n The Magistrate  \u2013 17 January 2013 [7] \n People  \u2013 21 March 2013 [8] \n This House  \u2013 16 May 2013 [9] \n The Audience  \u2013 13 June 2013 [10]  (broadcast from the  Gielgud Theatre  in the West End) \n Macbeth  \u2013 20 July 2013 [11]  (broadcast from the  Manchester International Festival ) \n Season 5 [ edit ] \n Othello  \u2013 26 September 2013 [12] [13] \n Coriolanus  \u2013 30 January 2014 [14]  (broadcast from the  Donmar Warehouse ) \n War Horse  \u2013 27 January 2014 - (National Theatre production broadcast from the  New London Theatre i n the West End) \n King Lear  \u2013 1 May 2014 [15] \n A Small Family Business  \u2013 12 June 2014 [16] \n Skylight  \u2013 17 July 2014 [17]  (broadcast from the  Wyndham's Theatre  in the West End) \n Season 6 [ edit ] \n Medea  \u2013 4 September 2014 [18] \n A Streetcar Named Desire  \u2013 16 September 2014 [19] \n JOHN  \u2013 9 December 2014 [20] \n Treasure Island  \u2013 22 January 2015 \n Behind the Beautiful Forevers  \u2013 12 March 2015 [21] \n A View From the Bridge  \u2013 26 March 2015 ( Young Vic  production broadcast from the  Wyndham's Theatre  in the West End) \n The Hard Problem  \u2013 16 April 2015 [22] \n Man and Superman  \u2013 14 May 2015 \n Everyman  \u2013 16 July 2015 [23] \n Season 7 [ edit ] \n The Beaux' Stratagem  \u2013 3 September 2015 \n Hamlet  \u2013 15 October 2015 (broadcast from the  Barbican Theatre ) \n Of Mice and Men  \u2013 19 November 2015 (broadcast from the  Longacre Theatre  on  Broadway ,  New York ) \n Jane Eyre  \u2013 8 December 2015 \n Les Liaisons Dangereuses  \u2013 28 January 2016 (broadcast from the Donmar Warehouse in the West End]]) \n As You Like It  \u2013 25 February 2016 \n Hangmen  \u2013 3 March 2016 ( Royal Court  production broadcast from  Wyndham's Theatre  in the West End) \n Season 8 [ edit ] \n The Deep Blue Sea  - 1 September 2016 \n The Threepenny Opera  - 22 September 2016 \n No Man's Land  - 15 December 2016 (broadcast from the  Wyndham's Theatre  in the West End) \n Amadeus  - 2 February 2017 \n Saint Joan  - 16 February 2017 (broadcast from the  Donmar Warehouse ) \n Hedda Gabler  - 9 March 2017 \n Twelfth Night  - 6 April 2017 \n Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead  - 20 April 2017 (broadcast from  The Old Vic ) \n Obsession  - 11 May 2017 (broadcast from the  Barbican Theatre ) \n Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
