Every municipality governed by this Code is represented by its council; its powers are exercised and its duties discharged by such council and its officers. \n M.C. 1916, a. 62 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 80 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 63 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 236 . 81 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 64 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 236 . 82 .   The council must directly exercise the powers conferred upon it by this Code; it cannot delegate them. Nevertheless, it may appoint committees composed of as many of its members at it deems advisable, with power to examine and study any question whatever.  In such case the committees must render account of their labours by reports signed by their chairman or by a majority of their members; and no report of a committee has any effect whatever until it has been adopted by the council at a regular sitting. \n M.C. 1916, a. 65 . 83 .   By-laws, resolutions and other municipal enactments must be passed by the council in session. \n M.C. 1916, a. 66 . 84 .   Any council which, under this Code, no longer possesses the powers which were conferred upon it under the authority of Acts antecedent to 1 November 1916, may repeal any enactment which it may have passed under such powers. \n M.C. 1916, a. 67 . 85 .   Every one who is entitled to be heard before the council or any of its committees, may be heard in person or by any other person acting of his behalf, whether authorized by power of attorney or not.  He may also call and examine witnesses. \n M.C. 1916, a. 68 . 86 .   The council or any committee, on every question or matter pending before them, may: ( 1 )  \u00a0 take communication of all documents or writings produced in evidence; ( 2 )  \u00a0 summon any person residing in the territory of the municipality; ( 3 )  \u00a0 examine under oath the parties and their witnesses, and cause an oath to be administered to each one either by one of their members or by the secretary-treasurer. The council may declare who shall bear and pay the costs incurred for the appearance of the witnesses heard or present, or for the summoning of witnesses who have made default, and may tax such costs, including reasonable travelling expenses, and $1 a day for the time of each witness.  The amount thus taxed may be recovered by ordinary action, either by the municipality or by the person who had advanced and paid the same, as the case may be. \n M.C. 1916, a. 69 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 237 . 87 .   If any one so summoned before the council or any committee fails, without just cause, to appear at the time and place mentioned in the summons, when compensation has been paid or offered to him for his reasonable travelling expenses for going and returning, and $1 a day for his time, he incurs a fine of not less than $4 nor more than $10. \n M.C. 1916, a. 70 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 239 . 88 .   Any document, order or proceeding of a council, the publication of which is required by this Code, or by the council itself, must be published in the same manner as public notices. \n M.C. 1916, a. 71 . 89 .   Any person depositing or filing any document relating to municipal matters in the office of the municipality or before the council in session, is entitled to a receipt or acknowledgment certifying to the deposit or filing of such document.  Such receipt is given by the secretary-treasurer, if the deposit is made at his office, or by the person presiding at the council, if filed before the council in session. Any secretary-treasurer or person presiding, who neglects or refuses to receive any such document, or to deposit the same in the archives of the municipality, or to give the required receipt, incurs a fine of not more than $100 in each case, in addition to the damages occasioned by such refusal or neglect. \n M.C. 1916, a. 72 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 90 .   Every document produced as an exhibit, and filed in the office of the municipality or with its officers, must be returned, on being tendered a receipt therefor, to the person who produced the same, whenever he requires it, after it has served the purpose for which it was filed. \n M.C. 1916, a. 73 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 91 .   The office of the municipality is that which is occupied by the secretary-treasurer in his official capacity, in accordance with article 183, and must be in the territory of the municipality, except in the case mentioned in article 92. \n M.C. 1916, a. 74 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 238 . 92 .   The office of a municipality or of any officer or employee of such municipality may be established in a local municipal territory situated in proximity to that of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 75; 1930, c. 104, s. 1 ;  1974, c. 81, s. 2 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 239 . 93 .   Every service, filing or deposit, to be made at the office of the municipality, may be made with equal validity upon or with the secretary-treasurer personally or at his domicile, speaking to a reasonable person belonging to his family. In such case, however, the receipt cannot be demanded unless the filing or deposit has been made with the secretary-treasurer personally. \n M.C. 1916, a. 76 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 94 .

A majority of the members of the committee constitutes a quorum. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 8 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 243 . 124 .   The council may, by by-law, delegate to the executive committee any of the powers it may exercise by resolution. However, the council cannot delegate to the executive committee the appointment and fixing of the salary of an employee assigned to a post the holder of which is not an employee within the meaning of the Labour Code (chapter C-27), nor the awarding of a contract the amount of which exceeds $10\u00a0000. The resolutions made by the executive committee have the same force and effect as if they were made by the council. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 8; 1979, c. 36, s. 7 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 244 ;  1997, c. 93, s. 70 . 125 .

The warden or, when he is absent, the deputy warden is  ex officio  the chairman of the executive committee. The secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality is  ex officio  the secretary of the executive committee, except if he is unable to act or he refuses, in which case the council proceeds to the appointment of a competent person and fixes his salary. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 8 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 245 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 127 .   In exercising any power devolved on it by delegation of the council, the executive committee is subject to the rules of this Code respecting the holding of its sittings and the general conduct of its affairs, inasmuch as such rules apply to such council and are consistent with the application of this Section. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 8 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 246 . DIVISION  III REGIONAL COUNTY MUNICIPALITY DELEGATES \n 1996, c. 2, s. 247 . 128 .   The delegates of every regional county municipality are three in number.

The warden is,  ex officio , one of the delegates. The other two delegates are appointed by the council, from among its members, at the sitting held in the month of November. They remain in office until their successors are duly installed even if they have ceased to form part of the council, unless, in the latter case, they have been replaced under article 130. \n M.C. 1916, a. 95; 1975, c. 82, s. 9; 1982, c. 63, s. 12 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 249 . 130 .   Whenever any one of the delegates dies, or is unable to attend to his duties during two consecutive months, or refuses to discharge such duties during a like period, the council appoints another delegate in his stead, at the first sitting held after such death or the expiry of two months.

The delegates meet at the time and place indicated in the notice of meeting given to them. \n M.C. 1916, a. 99 . 135 .   The meeting of the board of delegates is convened, upon a requisition in writing, by two members of the board, or by the secretary-treasurer of one of the regional county municipalities.

If the meeting has been convened by two members of the board, the secretary-treasurer of the municipality whereof such two members are the delegates, is the secretary of the board.  If the two members belong to different councils, the secretary of the board is appointed by the delegates, and must be the secretary-treasurer of one of the regional county municipalities. The secretary keeps minutes of the proceedings of the delegates, and deposits the same with all other documents of the board, in the archives of the municipality whose officer he is; and he forwards a copy to the office of each of the other regional county municipalities interested. The secretary-treasurer of each regional county municipality must forward to each local municipality interested, among the municipalities whose territory is included in that of the regional county municipality, a copy of every decision of the board of delegates. \n M.C. 1916, a. 102 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 253 . 138 .

Every disputed question is decided by the vote of the majority of the delegates present, the chairman having the same right to vote as the other delegates; in the event of an equal division of votes, the motion shall be submitted to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al and the latter shall appoint a person to act as an arbitrator whose decision shall have the same effect as a decision rendered by the board of delegates. The costs of the arbitration shall be paid in equal shares by the municipalities concerned.  The fees of the arbitrator shall, if they have not been determined by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al when appointing him, be fixed by a judge of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec, on petition, after notice to the parties interested.

If the sum to be paid does not exceed $25, the authorization of the head of the council is sufficient. Even in the absence of authorization from the council or from its head, it is his duty to pay, out of the funds of the municipality, any draft or order drawn upon him, or any sum demanded, by any one empowered so to do by this Code, or by any municipal by-law.

Whenever a rural inspector is for any reason whatever unable to act, the local council or the mayor must appoint another rural inspector of the municipality to replace him while so unable, by a written order which is served upon said inspector.

With respect to work to be performed in common, the inspector so interested is always in default to fulfil the obligations attached to such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 185 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 268 . 228 .

Whenever the services of a rural inspector are required in any locality situate partly within the boundaries of the jurisdiction of one rural inspector, and partly within the boundaries of the jurisdiction of another, one or other of such inspectors may be called upon to act. \n M.C. 1916, a. 188 . 231 .   Every rural inspector, when called upon to act, is entitled to $0.20 for every hour employed in visiting the locality, as well as in managing and superintending the work, if he does not perform it himself. The council may however, by by-law, grant him a higher remuneration when it deems it expedient to do so. He is also entitled to be repaid all necessary outlay and costs incurred by him for the performance of the work, and for notices or other written proceedings relating thereto. Such outlay and costs are paid by the person whom the rural inspector finds in default.  If no person is in default, they are paid by the party who applied for the services of the municipal officer.  In case of common or joint works, they are paid by all the interested parties, if they are all in default. In case of refusal or contestation they are recovered by an ordinary action. \n M.C. 1916, a. 189; 1948, c. 49, s. 1 . 232 .

After examining the premises, and on proof that such clearance is necessary and has been applied for by special notice in writing served before 1 December preceding he shall, by a written order, cause to be felled within the 30 following days, over an area 5\u00a0m wide on the whole dividing line along the cultivated land, all hurtful shrubs and all trees thereon throwing a shade on the cultivated land, save those excepted by law or kept to embellish the property. \n M.C. 1916, a. 195 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 238 .   Whoever refuses or neglects to obey the orders of the rural inspector with respect to the clearance, incurs, without prejudice to the execution of such orders, a fine of not more than $2 for each 60\u00a0m in length of such clearance, for the first year, and for every subsequent year a fine double that of the preceding year, over and above the damage occasioned to the cultivated land. \n M.C. 1916, a. 196 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 . 239 .   The damages occasioned by the refusal or neglect to make the clearance as required by the rural inspector are established by three experts appointed as follows: one by each of the interested parties and the third by the two experts so appointed. If one of the parties refuses to appoint an expert, the appointment is made by a justice of the peace, on the application of the other party. \n M.C. 1916, a. 197 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . \u00a7  4 . \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Boundary Ditches 240 .   The rural inspector, upon the written or verbal application of any owner or occupant who applies for a boundary ditch between his land and that of his neighbour, must visit the locality, where, after an examination of the place, and hearing of the interested parties, who must have received three days\u2019 special notice thereof, he orders the performance of any work which he deems necessary, and determines how and by whom it must be performed. The decision of the rural inspector must be in writing, the original whereof is deposited in the archives of the municipality, and any interested party may obtain a copy thereof certified by the inspector. \n M.C. 1916, a. 198 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 241 .   The rural inspector, on the written or verbal application of one of the neighbours who complains of the insufficiency or bad condition of the common or joint boundary ditch, or of the part thereof for which his neighbour is liable, must, if it is necessary, order the person in default to deepen, cleanse and repair such ditch or part of a ditch, or to do his share of such work within a fixed time.  Such time must not exceed the time absolutely necessary to perform such work. In case the work be not performed within such time, the inspector may authorize the complainant to do the work himself, the cost thereof to be recovered by an ordinary action. \n M.C. 1916, a. 199 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 242 .

The rural inspector of the division, on the written or verbal application of any owner or occupant who applies for the construction or repair, or any work necessary for the preservation, of any boundary fence between his land and that of his neighbour under article 1002 of the Civil Code, must visit the boundary in question, where, after having heard the interested parties, duly notified thereof by a special notice of three days, and examined the works required, he orders any party in default, whether complainant or not, to construct or repair his boundary fence, so that it be good and firm, within the time determined by such inspector.  Such time must be as short as possible. Such decision must be in writing, the original whereof is deposited in the archives of the municipality, and any interested party may obtain a copy thereof certified by the inspector. Whenever the boundary fence, the construction, repair or preservation whereof is applied for, separates lands subject to rights exercised in common by several persons, and generally known under the name of \u201cCove\u201d ( \u201cAnse\u201d ) or that of \u201cCommon\u201d ( \u201cCommune\u201d ), from the bordering and abutting lands, or from the abutting lands only, the rural inspector, after visiting the place and hearing the interested parties, may order, by the decision to be rendered by him, that the work applied for under the first paragraph shall be publicly given out to the lowest tenderer, after public notice, and he may apportion the cost of such work among the interested parties in proportion to the share for which each is responsible. \n M.C. 1916, a. 202; 1927, c. 75, s. 1 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 245 .

Whenever the waters of a river, serving as a division between two or more properties, become sufficiently low during the summer season to allow of animals crossing such river, the local municipality may, on application to that effect, pass a by-law ordering the erection of a temporary fence there as elsewhere. \n M.C. 1916, a. 204 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 269 . 247 .   The rural inspector cannot order the making of a new fence, or the repairing of an old one which is so dilapidated that the cost of repairing it would be equal to that of a new one, unless the party bound to do such work has received special notice in writing to that effect. \n M.C. 1916, a. 205; 1979, c. 36, s. 12 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 270 . \u00a7  6 . \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Enforcement of the Orders of Rural Inspectors 248 .

DIVISION  III POUND-KEEPERS 249 .   Pound-keepers are bound to receive and retain in safe-keeping animals found straying on any beach, flat, road, public place, or on any land other than that of their owners, and impounded by the rural inspector or by any other person who finds them, until such animals are claimed by their owners or sold at auction, under this Section. \n M.C. 1916, a. 207 . 250 .   Pound-keepers are bound to provide animals impounded under their charge, with proper food in sufficient quantities, and to take proper care of them. \n M.C. 1916, a. 208 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 243 . 251 .   Whenever any animal is impounded, it is the duty of the pound-keeper, under penalty of a fine of not less than $2 nor more than $10 for each failure on his part, to give without delay special notice, either written or verbal, to the owner of the animal impounded, if he is known and domiciled in the territory of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 209 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 . 252 .   If the animal is not claimed within 24 hours following such special notice, or if the owner thereof is unknown or does not reside in the territory of the municipality, the pound-keeper must, under the same penalty, give public notice, in which is set forth the species and color of the animal, the place where it was found straying, and the name of the place where it is impounded; and he must further announce its sale by auction on a day fixed, unless such animal is reclaimed by its owner upon payment of all expenses, fines, fees and costs incurred, as well as such damages as may be agreed upon, or as are determined according to article 262. \n M.C. 1916, a. 210 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 . 253 .

If the pound-keeper refuses or neglects to deliver the animal kept in pound, after such payment or tender has been made, he incurs a fine of $2 for every day he thereafter detains such animal, in addition to the damages occasioned by such refusal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 211 . 254 .   If, on the day fixed for the sale, the animal impounded has not been claimed, and if the damages agreed upon or determined, together with the fines, fees, expenses and costs incurred, have not been paid, such animal must be publicly sold by the pound-keeper to the highest and last bidder. \n M.C. 1916, a. 212 . 255 .   If, on the day fixed for the sale, there are no bidders, the sale is adjourned to another day, and public notice thereof is given without delay. \n M.C. 1916, a. 213 . 256 .   The price of adjudication must be paid on the spot, and before delivery, in default whereof the animal is again put up for sale. \n M.C. 1916, a. 214 . 257 .   The proceeds of the sale are employed in paying what is due in consequence of the impounding of the animal; the balance is placed without delay in the hands of the secretary-treasurer of the local municipality, and, if it is not claimed within three years by the owner of the animal sold, it belongs to the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 215 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 271 . 258 .   If the sale has not realized a sufficient sum, the owner of the animal is obliged to make up the balance. \n M.C. 1916, a. 216 . 259 .   If the owner of any animal so sold does not reside in the territory of the municipality, or if his business establishment is not situated therein, he may reclaim his animal from the purchaser, within one month from the day of sale, by paying him 10\u00a0% on the purchase money, over and above all disbursements for purchase, keep and other charges. \n M.C. 1916, a. 217 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 260 .   Whoever takes and conveys away any animal impounded, without permission from the pound-keeper, incurs a fine exceeding, by $2, the sum claimed on account of such animal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 218 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 244 . 261 .   The fines imposed on the owners of animals found straying are, for the first offence, as follows: \n For each stallion not under one year .......... $ 6.00  For each bull, boar or ram ....................   2.00  For each gelding, colt, filly, mare, ox,   cow, calf, heifer or ringed hog .............   0.25  For each goat or unringed hog .................   1.00  For each sheep ................................   0.10  For each goose, duck, turkey or other fowl ....   0.05  \n For each subsequent offence, the fine is double that imposed in the first instance. \n M.C. 1916, a. 219 . 262 .   In case of contestation, the damages occasioned by animals found straying are ascertained and determined by three experts appointed as follows: one by the complainant, one by the owner of the animal, and the other by the two experts already appointed. If the complainant or the owner of the animal is not present, his expert is appointed by the pound-keeper.  If one of the parties, or in his absence, the pound-keeper, refuses to appoint his expert, the appointment is made by a justice of the peace. Such experts must be appointed summarily and without delay, upon application of the owner of the animal or of the complainant. The experts at once proceed to visit the premises and to give their award, which is final. The amount of damages determined by them is recoverable, in case of refusal to pay the same, by an ordinary action. \n M.C. 1916, a. 220 . 263 .   No one is entitled to compensation for damage caused him upon his land by stray animals, if such damage is occasioned by the absence of or by any defect in his boundary fences. \n M.C. 1916, a. 221 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 264 .   It is not necessary that the animals found straying be impounded, to give rise to a right of action against the persons permitting such animals to stray, for the damages occasioned. \n M.C. 1916, a. 222 ;  1992, c. 61, s. 185 . 265 .   The owner, occupant or tenant of any land is answerable for any animal he receives to pasture thereon, as if such animal were his own property. \n M.C. 1916, a. 223 . 266 .   Persons in possession of animals found straying or impounded, have the same rights and privileges, and are subject to the same obligations and to the same penalties, as the owners of such animals. \n M.C. 1916, a. 224 ;  1992, c. 61, s. 186 . 267 .   Any owner, occupant or tenant of any land, or any member of his family, may take and impound on his own premises any animal found straying in the territory of the municipality, on any beach, flat, road, public place, or upon any land whatsoever. Such persons are then vested with the same powers, and subject to the same formalities, obligations and penalties as pound-keepers. In cases which come under this article, the animal so impounded cannot be sold except by the pound-keeper of the rural division, if there is one, or if there is no pound-keeper, or if he neglects to do so, then by the rural inspector of the division. \n M.C. 1916, a. 225 ;  1992, c. 61, s. 187 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 .

TITLE  XI APPOINTMENTS BY THE MINISTER OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS AND GREATER MONTR\u00c9AL \n 1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 410 .   Appointments to municipal offices are made by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, with the same effect as though made by the council, whenever a council has allowed the prescribed time to expire without making the appointment of an officer which it is bound to make under this Code or any by-law, with the exception, however, of that of the secretary-treasurer. \n M.C. 1916, a. 320; 1919-20, c. 67, s. 5 ;  1921, c. 48, s. 23; 1922 (2nd sess.), c. 85, s. 1 ;  1934, c. 83, s. 7; 1947, c. 77, s. 2; 1968, c. 86, s. 28 ;  1977, c. 53, s. 24 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 411 .   A municipal council which has neglected to appoint an officer of the municipality within the prescribed time may do so afterwards. \n M.C. 1916, a. 321; 1930, c. 103, s. 9 ;  1952-53, c. 23, s. 3; 1953-54, c. 31, s. 2 ;  1968, c. 86, s. 29 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 412 .   In the cases mentioned in this Title, it is the duty of the secretary-treasurer or, in his default, of the head of the council to thereof inform, by letter, without delay, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. Any ratepayer of the municipality may give him such information. \n M.C. 1916, a. 326; 1917-18, c. 20, s. 32 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 6 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 413 .   Every appointment made by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al must be made known by letter from the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al to the secretary-treasurer of the municipality, or to any of the members of the council whose appointment is announced by such letter. The person receiving such letter must, without delay, give a notice of his appointment to each of the persons so appointed. \n M.C. 1916, a. 328; 1917-18, c. 20, s. 33 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 8; 1977, c. 53, s. 26 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 414 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 329; 1977, c. 53, s. 27 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 750 . TITLE  XII MUNICIPAL NOTICES CHAPTER  I GENERAL PROVISIONS 415 .   Every notice under this Code, or under any order of a council, or for any municipal purpose, must be given, published and served in accordance with the formalities prescribed in this Title. \n M.C. 1916, a. 330 . 416 .   Every notice so given is either special or public. \n M.C. 1916, a. 331 . 417 .   Every notice in writing must contain: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the name of the municipality, when such notice is given by an officer or by the head of such municipality; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the name, official capacity and signature of the person who gives it; ( 3 )  \u00a0 a sufficient description of those to whom it is addressed; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the place where and the time when it is made; ( 5 )  \u00a0 the object for which it is given; ( 6 )  \u00a0 the place, day and hour at which those summoned to answer such notice must do so. \n M.C. 1916, a. 332 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 418 .   Every copy of a notice in writing which must be served, published, posted up or read is attested either by the person who gives such notice, or by the secretary-treasurer of the municipality under whose control such person acts. The copy may also be attested by the person in charge of access to documents of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 333 ;  1987, c. 68, s. 43 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 419 .   The original of every notice in writing must be accompanied by a certificate of publication or of service. The original of such notice and the certificate which accompanies it must be filed by the person who has given it, in the office of the municipality, to form part of the archives thereof. \n M.C. 1916, a. 334 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 420 .   The certificate must set forth: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the name, residence, official capacity and signature of the person who has given it; ( 2 )  \u00a0 a summary statement of the manner in which the notice was published or served; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the place, day and hour of publication or of service. The truth of the facts set forth in such certificate must be attested under the oath of office of the person giving it, if such person has taken an oath of office, and, if not, by his special oath. Such certificate is written either on the original notice or on a paper annexed thereto. \n M.C. 1916, a. 335 . 421 .   In the case of a special notice given verbally, the affirmation under oath of the person who served such notice takes the place of the certificate of service; such affirmation is only required in case of contestation, and must contain the object of the notice. \n M.C. 1916, a. 336 . 422 .   Any owner of land or any ratepayer, domiciled outside the territory of a municipality, may, by a special notice, filed in the office of the municipality, appoint an agent to represent him for all municipal purposes. \n M.C. 1916, a. 337 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 272 . 423 .   No person who has acquiesced in that which is required by a notice, or who has in any manner whatsoever become sufficiently acquainted with its tenor or object, can thereafter avail himself of the insufficiency or informality of such notice, or of the omission of its publication or service. \n M.C. 1916, a. 338 . CHAPTER  II SPECIAL NOTICES 424 .   Every special notice must be given verbally or in writing, except in particular cases in which the law prescribes that the special notice must be given in writing, and it must be given or drawn up in the language of the person to whom it is addressed, unless such person speaks a language other than French or English. A special notice given or addressed to any person who speaks neither the French nor the English language, or who speaks both of these languages, may be given in either language. \n M.C. 1916, a. 339 . 425 .   The service of a special written notice is made by leaving a copy of the notice with the person to whom it is addressed, in person, or at his domicile or business establishment; if the service is made at his domicile, the copy may be left with a reasonable member of his family; if at his business establishment, the copy may be left with any person employed there. \n M.C. 1916, a. 340 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 426 .   Every special notice in writing addressed to an absent proprietor or ratepayer, who has appointed an agent residing in the territory of the municipality, must be served on such agent, in the same manner as on a resident proprietor. If an agent resident in the territory of the municipality has not been appointed, every such notice is served by lodging in the post-office of the locality a copy thereof, in a sealed and registered or certified envelope, addressed to the absent proprietor or ratepayer, or to any other agent if he has appointed one. \n M.C. 1916, a. 341; 1975, c. 83, s. 84 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 . 427 .   A special verbal notice is given by the person who should give it, or on his behalf, to the person to whom it is addressed, in person, or at his domicile to a reasonable member of his family, or at his business establishment to a person employed there. \n M.C. 1916, a. 342 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 428 .   Special notices may be served between the hours of 7 o\u2019clock in the morning and 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, and even upon holidays. Special notices, however, cannot be served at business establishments except upon juridical days. \n M.C. 1916, a. 343 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 429 .   If the doors of the domicile or business establishment, where service of a special notice in writing is to be made, are closed, or if there is not a reasonable member of the family at the domicile, or a person employed at the business establishment, service is effected by affixing a copy of the notice to one of the doors of the domicile or of the business establishment. \n M.C. 1916, a. 344 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 430 .   The intermediate time after a special notice begins to run from the day on which such notice was served, such day not being included. \n M.C. 1916, a. 345 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . CHAPTER  III PUBLIC NOTICES 431 .   Public notices must be in writing. The publication of a public notice for local municipal purposes is made by posting a copy of such notice at two different places in the territory of the municipality, fixed from time to time by resolution. In default of localities fixed by the council, the public notice must be posted on or near the principal door of at least one place of public worship, if any there be, and at some other place of public resort in the territory of such municipality. In either case, if there is a Roman Catholic church in the territory of the municipality, the notice must be posted on or near the main door of such church. \n M.C. 1916, a. 346 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 . 432 .   The council may fix as one of the localities for the posting of public notices, a locality situated in a local municipal territory contiguous to the territory of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 347; 1930, c. 103, s. 10 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 21 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 273 . 433 .   Every public notice of a regional county municipality that is intended for the inhabitants of the territory of a local municipality is posted in the same localities and in the same manner as a public notice of such local municipality. The officers of the regional county municipality giving such notice may, by letter, order the secretary-treasurer of each such local municipality, after having transmitted to him as many copies of such notice as are requisite, to provide that the same be posted as required, and that a certificate of the publication thereof be transmitted to them without delay, under penalty of a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $40. \n M.C. 1916, a. 349 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 274 . 434 .   Every public notice convening any public meeting, or for any object whatever, must be published at least seven clear days before the day appointed for such meeting or other proceeding, except in cases otherwise provided for. \n M.C. 1916, a. 350 . 435 .   Except in cases otherwise provided for, the intermediate time after a public notice begins to run from the date on which such notice has been published under article 431 or article 433, exclusive of such date. \n M.C. 1916, a. 351 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 436 .   Public notices are applicable to and binding upon proprietors or ratepayers domiciled outside the territory of the municipality, in the same manner as upon residents, except in cases otherwise provided for. \n M.C. 1916, a. 352 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 275 . 437 .   Every person who wilfully tears down, injures or defaces any document whatsoever posted in any public place under the authority of this Code, incurs a fine of not less than $1 nor more than $8 for each offence. \n M.C. 1916, a. 353 . 437.1 .   Every notice or document, other than an advertisement referred to in article 935 or a document referred to in article 1027, which a municipality must publish for municipal purposes under this Code or any other Act in a newspaper circulated in its territory, may be published in a municipal information bulletin rather than in a newspaper. The municipal information bulletin shall ( 1 )  \u00a0 be mailed or otherwise distributed free of charge to each address in the territory of the municipality, and be received not later than on the publication date indicated therein; ( 2 )  \u00a0 be transmitted, on request and on payment of subscription fees, where applicable, to every person domiciled or not in the territory of the municipality; ( 3 )  \u00a0 be published at least eight times a year or at the intervals established by by-law of the municipality. \n 1995, c. 34, s. 36 ;  1996, c. 77, s. 26 ;  1997, c. 53, s. 11 . 437.2 .   Every municipality may pass by-laws ( 1 )  \u00a0 to establish a mail subscription service for notices, minutes, by-laws or any other type of documents emanating from the council and fix the subscription rates; ( 2 )  \u00a0 to provide for the publishing of information documents on the municipal administration and related events. \n 1995, c. 34, s. 36 . TITLE  XII.1 PROCEEDINGS AND ORDERS IN MATTERS OF ACTIVITIES OR USES \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.3 .   The council of a local municipality may, for a period not exceeding 90 days, prohibit access to any immovable or part of an immovable accessible to the public in which an activity or use is carried on without the permit, certificate or other authorization required by the municipality where the activity or use may endanger the life or health of persons or cause serious or irreparable damage to property. The decision of the council must contain reasons and be accompanied by a copy of any report, statement of offence or other document on which the decision is based.  It shall be notified to the delinquent and the owner or operator of the immovable.  The decision shall take effect on the date on which the owner or operator is notified of the decision. The council shall lift the prohibition of access to the premises before the expiry of the period fixed where the required permit, certificate or authorization is granted by the municipality or where, in its opinion, a change in activity or use causes the permit, certificate or authorization to be no longer required.  The council shall notify all interested persons of the decision. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.4 .   Where the delinquent or the owner or operator of the immovable is, in his opinion, aggrieved by a decision of the council made under article 437.3, he may, within 10 days of notification thereof, contest the decision before the Court of Qu\u00e9bec. The proceeding shall be brought by the filing of a motion and is governed by articles 762 to 773 of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C-25). The motion shall be heard and decided by preference.  It shall not suspend the contested decision, unless a judge orders otherwise. The court may confirm, vary or quash the decision of the council. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.5 .   The council of a local municipality may apply to the Court of Qu\u00e9bec, in accordance with the rules contained in articles 762 to 773 of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C-25), for the cancellation of the permit, certificate or any other authorization granted by the municipality for an activity or use in an immovable or part of an immovable accessible to the public ( 1 )  \u00a0 where the activity or use may endanger the life or health of persons or cause serious or irreparable damage to property; ( 2 )  \u00a0 where the activity or use disturbs public tranquility. Any such motion shall be heard and decided by preference. Such a proceeding, however, may not be brought in cases where an application may be made by the municipality to the R\u00e9gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux under section 85 of the Act respecting liquor permits (chapter P-9.1). \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.6 .   In the case of a proceeding brought under subparagraph 1 of the first paragraph of article 437.5, the council of a local municipality may order that the holder suspend the activity or use concerned and prohibit access to the immovable or the part of an immovable in which the activity or use is carried on until the court makes a determination in respect of the application for cancellation or until it orders otherwise. The decision of the council must give reasons and be accompanied by a copy of the report, of the statement of offence or of any other document on which the decision must be based.  The decision must be filed in the court record. The decision shall take effect on the date on which the holder is notified of the decision. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.7 .   Where public tranquility is at issue under subparagraph 2 of the first paragraph of article 437.5, the court may, among other factors, take into account: ( 1 )  \u00a0 any gathering or assembly that results or may result from the activity or use, that may cause excessive noise or otherwise disturb the peace in the neighbourhood; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the failure by the holder to take appropriate measures to prevent, in the premises concerned, ( a )  \u00a0 the unlawful possession, consumption, sale, exchange or giving, in any manner, of a drug, narcotic or any other substance that may be held to be a drug or narcotic; ( b )  \u00a0 the unlawful possession of a firearm or any other offensive weapon; ( c )  \u00a0 acts of violence, including theft or mischief, that may disturb the peace of occupants or customers or of residents of the neighbourhood. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.8 .   Where the court cancels a permit, certificate or authorization, it may, on application by the council, order that no permit, certificate or other authorization be granted by the municipality, for the premises to which the decision to cancel applies, or prohibit access to such premises, for a period not exceeding 12 months or until, in the opinion of the council, a change of activity or use justifies the granting of a permit, certificate or authorization or the lifting of the prohibition before the end of the period. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.9 .   The local municipality shall post any decision, made by the council or the court under this title, on the premises to which the decision or judgment applies, along with a notice indicating the penalty to which any offender is liable. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . 437.10 .   Every person who continues an activity or use even though the required permit, certificate or authorization has been cancelled by the court or despite an order of suspension or a prohibition of access issued under article 437.6 is liable to a fine of $600 to $2,000. Every person who is present in an immovable or part of an immovable to which a prohibition of access applies without a legitimate excuse or an authorization from the council or the court, as the case may be, is liable to a fine of $300 to $1,000. In the case of a subsequent offence, the fines are doubled. \n 1997, c. 51, s. 3 . TITLE  XIII RESOLUTIONS CHAPTER  I GENERAL PROVISION 438 .   Whenever any municipality deems it advisable to avail itself of the powers which are granted to it by this Title, for any of the objects therein mentioned, it must do so by resolution. This article does not affect the right which all municipalities have to decide and exercise, by resolution, all acts of administration concerning them and which are not incompatible with this Code. \n M.C. 1916, a. 354 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . CHAPTER  II RESOLUTIONS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF ALL MUNICIPALITIES \n 1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 439 .

TITLE  XIV BY-LAWS AND CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS \n 1996, c. 27, s. 59 . CHAPTER  I FORMALITIES RESPECTING BY-LAWS DIVISION  I PASSING, PROMULGATION AND COMING INTO FORCE OF BY-LAWS 445 .   Every by-law must, on pain of absolute nullity, be preceded by a notice of motion given at a sitting of the council, and it can be read and passed only at a subsequent sitting held on a later date. It is not necessary to read the by-law if a motion to dispense with the reading is made at the same time as the notice of motion and if a copy of the proposed by-law is handed immediately to the members of the council present and remitted to the other members not later than two juridical days before the sitting at which it is to be approved and if, at that sitting, every member of the council present states that he has read it and waives the reading of it.  In this case, however, the secretary-treasurer or the person presiding at the meeting must mention the object of the by-law, its implications, its scope, its cost, and, where that applies, the mode of financing and payment and repayment. The person in charge of access to documents of the municipality shall issue a copy of the by-law to every person requesting it within the two juridical days preceding the meeting.  He shall also take the necessary measures to ensure that copies of the by-law are put at the disposal of the public at the beginning of the meeting, for reference. However, in the case of a by-law passed by the council of a regional county municipality, the notice of motion may be replaced by a notice given by registered or certified letter to the mayors of the local municipalities whose territory is included in that of the regional county municipality and, where applicable, to the warden elected in accordance with section 210.29.2 of the Act respecting municipal territorial organization (chapter O-9).  The secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality shall transmit such notice to the mayors at least 10 days before the date of the sitting at which the by-law mentioned in the notice will be considered.  He shall post up the notice within the same time at the office of the regional county municipality. The preceding paragraph shall apply,  mutatis mutandis , to by-laws passed by a board of delegates. \n M.C. 1916, a. 359; 1935, c. 108, s. 3 ;  1949, c. 71, s. 9; 1975, c. 83, s. 84; 1979, c. 36, s. 16 ;  1987, c. 68, s. 44 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 279 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 46 . 446 .   The original of every by-law, to be authentic, must be signed either by the head of the council, or by the person presiding at the sitting of the council at the time such by-law was passed, and by the secretary-treasurer. In no case where this Code or any other general law or special Act provides that a by-law must receive an approval may the by-law be published or come into force until it has received that approval.  In such a case, a certificate signed by the head of the council and by the secretary-treasurer, certifying the date of each of the required approvals, must accompany and forms part of the original of such by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 360; 1947, c. 77, s. 9; 1982, c. 63, s. 22 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 280 . 447 .   As soon as possible after the coming into force of a by-law of a regional county municipality, the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality shall transmit a certified true copy thereof to each local municipality in whose territory the by-law is in force. \n M.C. 1916, a. 361 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 281 . 448 .   Every by-law must be entered in the minute-book and in a special book that constitutes the register of by-laws of the municipality; such entries must be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the secretary-treasurer. The secretary-treasurer must further indicate at the end of every by-law the date of the posting up of the notice of publication of such by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 362; 1944, c. 46, s. 2 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 282 . 449 .   Several subject matters may be provided for in one and the same by-law. Should several subject matters provided for in one and the same by-law require certain approvals before coming into force, it shall not be necessary that each of these subject matters receive such approvals separately but it shall be sufficient that they be given to the by-law as a whole. \n M.C. 1916, a. 363; 1947, c. 77, s. 10 . 450 .   Except where otherwise provided by law, every by-law comes into force and is effective as law, if not otherwise provided for therein, on the day of its publication. \n M.C. 1916, a. 364; 1982, c. 63, s. 23 . 451 .   Every by-law is published after it has been passed or received its final approval if it has been submitted to one or several of the approvals mentioned in the second paragraph of article 446, by a public notice mentioning the object of the by-law, the date of the passing thereof, and the place where communication thereof may be had. Such notice is given under the hand of the secretary-treasurer, and is published in the ordinary manner. If the by-law has received one or more of the approvals mentioned in the second paragraph of article 446, the notice of publication must mention the date and the fact of each of these approvals. \n M.C. 1916, a. 366; 1947, c. 77, s. 11; 1982, c. 63, s. 25 . 452 .   Every by-law remains in force and is executory until it has been amended, repealed or annulled by competent authority, or until the expiration of the time for which it was made. \n M.C. 1916, a. 368 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 453 .   No by-law which, before coming into force and effect was submitted to one or more of the approvals mentioned in the second paragraph of article 446, can be amended or repealed except by another by-law approved in the same manner. \n M.C. 1916, a. 369; 1947, c. 77, s. 12 . 454 .   No by-law can be repealed or amended except by another by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 370 . DIVISION  II PENALTIES IN CONNECTION WITH BY-LAWS 455 .   Except where the applicable penalty is provided for by law, the council may, by by-law, ( 1 )  \u00a0 prescribe that an offence under any regulatory provision coming under its jurisdiction shall be sanctioned by a fine; ( 2 )  \u00a0 prescribe either a fine of a fixed amount, or the minimum and maximum fines or a minimum fine of $1 and a maximum fine. The fixed amount or maximum amount prescribed cannot exceed, for a first offence, $1,000 if the offender is a natural person, or $2,000 if the offender is a legal person.  In the case of a second or subsequent conviction, the fixed amount or maximum amount prescribed cannot exceed $2,000 if the offender is a natural person, or $4,000 if the offender is a legal person. \n M.C. 1916, a. 371; 1927, c. 74, s. 8; 1939, c. 98, s. 2 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 13; 1954-55, c. 50, s. 11 ;  1975, c. 82, s. 19; 1979, c. 36, s. 17 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 247 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 34 .

DIVISION  V APPROVAL OTHER THAN THAT OF THE QUALIFIED VOTERS \n 1987, c. 57, s. 753 . 486 .   Where this Code or any other general law or special Act provides that a by-law must receive an approval other than that of the qualified voters, the secretary-treasurer, after the by-law has been approved by the qualified voters, if their approval is required, must forward a certified copy of the by-law, together with every other document required by the person to whom it is to be forwarded, to: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, if his approval or that of the Government or of the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec is required, or ( 2 )  \u00a0 the minister, body or person whose approval is required, in other cases. The secretary-treasurer must provide the person to whom the certified copy is to be forwarded with any information requested by him with respect to the by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 388; 1917-18, c. 20, s. 34 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 15; 1982, c. 63, s. 27 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 754 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 35 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 487 .

The Government or the minister, body or person whose approval is required may approve the by-law in part only. Notwithstanding article 453, a council having passed a by-law requiring the approval of the Government, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al or the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec may, by resolution, amend the by-law before it is so approved, without its being necessary to obtain any other approval, provided that the amendments do not result in increasing the charges upon the ratepayers or in changing the object of the by-law.  The Government, the Minister or the Commission may then approve the by-law so amended. \n 1929, c. 88, s. 18; 1943, c. 48, s. 1 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 27 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 489 .   The approval of a by-law or other proceeding of a council by the Government or the minister, body or person whose approval is required has no other effect than that of rendering such by-law or proceeding executory, according to law, from its coming into force.  That may be done with the same effect in the form of an authorization. \n 1954-55, c. 50, s. 12; 1982, c. 63, s. 27 .

Such prohibition shall take effect from the notice of motion of the by-law intended to prohibit the demolition. However, if such by-law is not adopted and enforced within three months of the date of the notice of motion, such prohibition shall cease to apply. Within the 15 days following the adoption of such by-law, the municipality must address a request to the Minister of Culture and Communications in order that the immovable concerned be recognized or classified as cultural property within the meaning of the Cultural Property Act, or that the identified territory be declared a historic or natural district within the meaning of the said Act. If, at the expiry of the time of 12 months from the date of the notice of motion, the Minister of Culture and Communications has not recognized or classified the immovable concerned as cultural property, or has not declared the territory concerned a historic or natural district or if the Minister of Culture and Communications has not given the notice of intention under the Cultural Property Act, the by-law ceases to have effect.

The by-law may also prescribe that, if the programme is approved, the proprietor furnish to the municipality, prior to the issuance of his permit, a monetary guarantee of execution of that programme in an amount not exceeding the value entered on the valuation roll of the immovable to be demolished. That programme may be approved only if it is in conformity with the by-laws of the municipality.  To determine that conformity, the committee must consider the by-laws in force at the time the programme is submitted to it, except in the case where the issuance of a building permit for the proposed programme is suspended by reason of a notice of motion.  When the issuance of permits is thus suspended, the committee shall not approve the programme before the expiration of the suspension or before the coming into force of the amending by-law contemplated in the notice of motion, if such coming into force occurs before the expiration of the suspension; the decision of the committee is then rendered having regard to the by-laws in force at the time of such decision. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 498 .   On being seized of an application for a demolition permit, the committee must cause a notice of the application, easily visible to passers-by, to be posted on the immovable contemplated in the application.  Furthermore, it must immediately cause a public notice of the application to be published, except in the cases contemplated by a by-law adopted pursuant to article 496. Every notice contemplated in this article must reproduce the first paragraph of article 500. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 499 .   The applicant must send, by registered or certified mail, a notice of the application to each of the lessees of the immovable. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 500 .   Every person wishing to oppose the granting of a demolition permit must, within 10 days of publication of the public notice or, failing such notice, within the 10 days following the posting of the notice on the immovable concerned, make his objections known in writing to the secretary-treasurer of the municipality, giving the reasons for his objections. Before rendering its decision, the committee must consider the objections received.  Its sittings are public. The committee may, in addition, hold a public hearing if it considers it advisable. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 501 .   Where the immovable contemplated in the application includes one or more dwellings, a person wishing to preserve that immovable as rental housing may, at the hearing of the application, intervene to ask for a delay to undertake or pursue negotiations to acquire the immovable. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 502 .   The committee shall postpone its decision if it believes that the circumstances justify it, and grant the intervener a period of not more than two months from the end of the hearing to allow the negotiations to reach a conclusion.  The committee shall postpone its decision for that reason only once. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 503 .   The committee shall grant the permit if it is convinced of the advisability of the demolition, taking into account the public interest and the interest of the parties. The committee, before deciding an application for a demolition permit, must consider the condition of the immovable contemplated in the application, the deterioration of the architectural appearance or esthetic character of the neighbourhood or the quality of life in the neighbourhood and the cost of restoration, the intended use of the vacated land any other pertinent criterion, in particular, where the immovable includes one or more dwellings, the prejudice caused to lessees, the housing needs in the area and the possibilities of relocation of the lessees. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 504 .   The committee must, in addition, reject the application for a permit if the preliminary programme of re-utilization of the vacated land has not been approved, if the procedure of application for permits has not been substantially complied with or if the exigible fees have not been paid. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 505 .   Where the committee grants the permit, it may impose any condition relating to the demolition of the immovable or the re-utilization of the vacated land.  It may, in particular, determine the conditions of the relocation of a lessee, where the immovable includes one or more dwellings. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 506 .   A lessor to whom a demolition permit has been issued may evict a lessee to demolish a dwelling. However, no lessee may be compelled to leave his dwelling before the term of the lease nor before the expiry of three months from the issuance of the permit. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 507 .   The lessor must pay to the lessee evicted from his dwelling an indemnity equal to three months\u2019 rent and his moving expenses. If the damage sustained by the lessee is greater, he may apply to the R\u00e9gie du logement to fix the amount of the damages. The indemnity is payable at the expiry of the lease, and the moving expenses, on presentation of the vouchers. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 508 .   Where the committee grants the permit, it may fix the time within which the demolition work must be undertaken and completed. It may, for reasonable cause, change the time fixed, provided that the application for the change is made to it before the time has expired. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 509 .   If the demolition work is not undertaken before the expiry of the time fixed by the committee, the demolition permit is without effect. If, on that date, in the case of an immovable that includes one or more dwellings, a lessee continues to occupy his dwelling, the lease is extended of right and the lessor may, within one month, apply to the R\u00e9gie du logement to fix the rent. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 510 .   If the work is not completed within the time fixed, the council may cause it to be carried out and recover the costs thereof from the proprietor.  The costs constitute a prior claim on the land where the immovable was situated, of the same nature and with the same rank as the claims described in paragraph 5 of article 2651 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec; the costs are secured by a legal hypothec on the land. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 485 ;  1994, c. 30, s. 93 . 511 .   The decision of the committee concerning the issuance of the permit must be substantiated and be sent immediately to every party concerned by registered or certified mail. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 512 .   Every interested person may, within 30 days from a decision of the committee, appeal to the council from the decision. Every member of the council, including a member of the committee, may sit on the council to hear an appeal made in virtue of the first paragraph. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 513 .   The council may confirm a decision of the committee or render the decision that the committee should have rendered. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 514 .   No demolition permit may be issued before the expiry of 30 days as provided in article 512 nor, if there has been an appeal under that article, before the council has rendered a decision authorizing the issuance of such a permit. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 515 .   Every person who carries out the demolition of an immovable or causes it to be carried out without a permit or in contravention of the conditions of the permit is liable to a fine of not less than $5\u00a0000 nor more than $25\u00a0000. In addition, the by-law contemplated in article 496 may require that person to restore the immovable so demolished to its former condition.  Where the offender fails to restore the immovable in accordance with the by-law, the council may cause the work to be carried out and recover the costs thereof from the offender, in which case article 510 applies, with the necessary modifications. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 . 516 .   At all times while the demolition work is being carried out, a person in authority on the premises must have a copy of the permit in his possession.  An officer or employee of the municipality designated by the council may, at any reasonable time, enter the premises where that work is being carried out to ascertain whether the demolition is in conformity with the permit.  The officer or employee shall, on request, identify himself and produce the certificate of his capacity issued by the municipality.  The refusal to allow the officer or the employee of the municipality on the premises or to let him see the copy of the permit renders the contravening person liable to a fine not exceeding $500. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 ;  1986, c. 95, s. 85 . 517 .   A local municipality that has adopted a by-law in virtue of article 496 must constitute a committee having the functions of deciding applications for demolition permits and exercising any other powers conferred on it by this Subsection. This committee shall be composed of three members of the council designated for one year by the council.  Their term is renewable. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 518 .   A member of the council who ceases to be a member of the committee before the end of his term, is unable to act or has a direct or indirect personal interest in a matter of which the committee is seized, shall be replaced by another member of the council designated by the council for the unexpired portion of his term, for the duration of his inability to act or for the duration of the hearing of the matter in which he has an interest, as the case may be. \n 1979, c. 48, s. 123 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 519 .

Such a by-law needs no approval.  Notwithstanding articles 453, 1076 and 1077, any by-law or provision of a by-law made under this subparagraph may be repealed or amended without approval. ( b )  \u00a0 every proprietor having one or more tenants, subtenants or occupants, is liable for the payment of such compensation in the event of his refusing or neglecting to furnish a separate and distinct supply pipe to each such tenant, sub-tenant or occupant; ( 4 )  \u00a0 to provide for the payment of an annual subsidy to any company, person or partnership undertaking the construction of any waterworks, public well or reservoir, during such period as may be agreed upon.  Every by-law made under this paragraph must be submitted to the qualified voters and to the Government for approval; where it is necessary to hold a referendum poll, approval of the by-law by the qualified voters requires not only that the number of affirmative votes be greater than the number of negative votes but also that it be equal to or greater than one third of the number of qualified voters; ( 5 )  \u00a0 to provide for the lighting: ( a )  \u00a0 of the whole of its territory, at its expense, or of any part of its territory, at the expense of the ratepayers of that part; ( b )  \u00a0 of any part of its territory, at its expense or at the expense both of the municipality and of the ratepayers of the lighted part, in such proportion as may be determined by the by-law. Such a by-law requires no approval.  Notwithstanding article 453, a by-law or any provision of a by-law adopted under this paragraph which came into force before 27 June 1975 may be replaced or amended without approval; ( 6 )  \u00a0 to provide for the installation and operation of lighting, heating or power development systems, by means of gas or electricity, for the requirements both of the public and of persons requiring the same in their houses, buildings or establishments. The council is vested with all the powers necessary for the above purposes.  It may, by by-law, fix the price of gas or electricity supplied to persons; it may likewise, in order to meet the interest on the money expended and to create a sinking-fund therefor, impose upon all the taxable immovable property in the whole territory of the municipality or in any part thereof, a special annual tax, the allotment of which shall be based upon the valuation roll in force at the time it is imposed. But whenever the revenue of the system exceeds, in any year, the cost of its operation and of its upkeep, the council may employ the excess of receipts over expenses to pay the interest, or may pay it into the sinking-fund, and during the next year, decrease by so much the tax on immovables imposed for such purpose, or even suspend the collection thereof if the surplus revenue be sufficient for the interest and the sinking-fund premium, and that by means of a simple resolution. At the expiration of the term mentioned in any contract entered into between the council and any public utility company, respecting the supplying of electricity for light, heat and power by such company to the municipality which itself distributes same to its ratepayers, the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec, on a petition to that effect, may order that the contract be extended or renewed on such other or similar terms, prices and conditions, as it may determine. In addition, the municipality may make by-laws to prevent fraud in respect of the quantity of gas or electricity supplied and to protect the wires, pipes, equipment and other implements used for the supplying of gas or electricity; ( 7 )  \u00a0 to prescribe that poles and other supportive facilities, though owned by one person, must, in the whole territory of the municipality or in any part thereof designated by the council, be utilized in common by every telephone, telegraph, electric supply and cable-delivery undertaking and by any other service. The by-laws ordering such utilization in common come into force and have effect on approval, with or without amendment, by the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec. An appeal lies to the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec by a motion of any interested party, from any resolution, decision or act whatsoever of the municipality, in any matter relating to such utilization in common. Such appeal must, under pain of nullity, be brought within 30 days of the date of receipt, by the interested party, of a notice announcing the fact appealed from. If the notice is sent by mail, it is deemed received on being mailed. The appeal is made by means of an inscription filed with the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec; notice thereof must be served on the adverse party or on his attorney. Any dispute between interested parties arising out of the utilization in common must be submitted to the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec; ( 8 )  \u00a0 to provide for the establishment and administration of a radio and television community antenna system for public needs and the needs of those persons who wish to use it in their houses, buildings or establishments; paragraph 6 applies with the necessary modifications to this provision.  However, the council shall not, in exercising the powers granted by this paragraph, acquire by expropriation the systems existing in the territory of the municipality; ( 9 )  \u00a0 to compel the owners or occupants of lands situated both in the territory of the municipality and in neighbouring local municipal territories not more than 48\u00a0km distant, to permit and allow all works undertaken for the purpose of providing the inhabitants of the territory of the municipality with water or light, to be carried on, and the taking possession, for the purpose of supplying and feeding such waterworks and other hydraulic constructions, of the lakes, non-navigable rivers, ponds, springs, and watercourses having their source of flowing on private property; without, however, prejudicing the rights of the riparian proprietors to make use thereof, as well under the common law as under the laws respecting watercourses, subject to the indemnity to be determined by agreement with the interested parties, or, failing such agreement, in conformity with article 560; ( 10 )  \u00a0 to provide for the taking of the whole or any part of the drainage basin of any lake, non-navigable river, pond, spring or watercourse situated in the territory of the municipality or within a radius of not more than 48\u00a0km therefrom, which the council may deem necessary in connection with the supply of pure water to the inhabitants of the territory of the municipality, subject to the indemnity to be determined by agreement with the interested parties, or, failing such agreement, in conformity with article 560; ( 11 )  \u00a0 to take possession of any immovable or servitude, situated in the territory of the municipality or within a radius of 48\u00a0km therefrom, which the council deems necessary for the establishment of sewers or accessory works, such as septic tanks, in return for an indemnity fixed by agreement or, failing agreement, in accordance with article 560; ( 12 )  \u00a0 ( a )  \u00a0 to transfer its rights and powers, respecting the supplying of water, or respecting sewers to any company, person or partnership wishing to take charge thereof; provided that such company, person or partnership does not exact, for the supplying of the water, or for the use of sewers, higher rates than those fixed and approved by by-law; and the municipality may take stock in such company, or lend money to such company, person or partnership; ( b )  \u00a0 if the price of the shares fixed by such by-law is not in hand, none of such shares can be taken or subscribed for in execution of such by-law, by the head of the council or other person thereunto authorized, before the municipality has ordered a bond issue, or a loan to be contracted, sufficient to cover the amount of shares to be subscribed for. \n M.C. 1916, a. 408 ( part ) ;  1919-20, c. 82, s. 2; 1921, c. 48, s. 25 ;  1926, c. 69, s. 1; 1927, c. 74, s. 11 ;  1928, c. 94, s. 14; 1930, c. 103, s. 15 ;  1930-31, c. 114, s. 6; 1930-31, c. 116, s. 1 ;  1931-32, c. 103, s. 5; 1934, c. 85, s. 1 ;  1935, c. 24, Sch.; 1935, c. 108, s. 5 ;  1937, c. 100, s. 1, s. 2; 1941, c. 69, s. 14 ;  1943, c. 48, s. 2; 1944, c. 46, s. 3 ;  1946, c. 55, s. 6; 1949, c. 59, s. 63 ;  1955-56, c. 42, s. 4; 1959, c. 11, s. 2 ;  1968, c. 86, s. 32; 1972, c. 42, s. 64 ;  1972, c. 49, s. 136; 1973, c. 38, s. 91 ;  1975, c. 31, s. 15; 1975, c. 82, s. 25 ;  1977, c. 53, s. 33; 1979, c. 36, s. 32 ;  1979, c. 49, s. 33 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1987, c. 42, s. 6 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 755 ;  1988, c. 8, s. 82 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 302 ;  1997, c. 83, s. 43 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  2000, c. 22, s. 68 . 557.1 .

However, section 103, except subsection 3, and sections 113, 114 and 123 of Part I of the said Act apply,  mutatis mutandis , subject to this Section and the by-law approved by the Inspector General of Financial Institutions.

(Repealed). \n 1982, c. 65, s. 1 ;  1993, c. 3, s. 114 . 665 .   An assessment ordered under this Section is deemed a special business tax for the purposes of its collection and the secretary-treasurer has all the powers vested in him in that respect by this Code and the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F-2.1 ). The assessments collected, minus collection costs, and the list of the members who have paid them are remitted to the association. \n 1982, c. 65, s. 1 ;  1993, c. 3, s. 115 . 666 .

The council resolution granting the application of an association extends or limits the jurisdiction of the association to the district thus changed. \n 1982, c. 65, s. 1 . 672 .   An association may, according to the modalities and on the conditions established in its by-laws, for the voluntary membership of persons having a place of business outside the district or occupying an immovable, other than a place of business, situated in or outside the district. \n 1982, c. 65, s. 1 ;  1993, c. 3, s. 117 . 673 .   The resolution changing the limits of the district of the association must be transmitted to the Inspector General of Financial Institutions in three certified true copies.

Every regional county municipality may make, amend or repeal by-laws or resolutions, as the case may be, upon each of the matters mentioned in articles 490 to 524, article 543, paragraph 2 of article 544, articles 557.1 and 557.2 and articles 569 to 626, and may exercise, for regional purposes, the general power to pass by-laws conferred by article 628. Any regional county municipality may also make, amend or repeal by-laws or, as the case may be, resolutions for the creation of a limited partnership with a private-sector enterprise for the purpose of producing electric power by means of a hydro-electric power station with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or less attributable to hydraulic power vested in the domain of the State. Articles 557.1 and 557.2 apply with the necessary modifications. \n M.C. 1916, a. 422; 1952-53, c. 23, s. 4 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 56 ;  1987, c. 102, s. 43 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 318 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 77 ;  1996, c. 77, s. 31 ;  1998, c. 31, s. 50 ;  1999, c. 75, s. 37 ;  2000, c. 22, s. 60 ;  2000, c. 34, s. 261 . 678.0.1 .   A regional county municipality may affirm its jurisdiction in respect of the local municipalities whose territory is included in its territory with respect to all or part of a field within their jurisdiction. The resolution by which a regional county municipality affirms its jurisdiction with respect to the providing of a police service in whole or in part, must, in order to take effect, be approved by the Minister of Public Security. \n 1987, c. 102, s. 44 ;  1991, c. 32, s. 170 ;  1993, c. 65, s. 97 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 319 ;  1997, c. 93, s. 85 ;  1998, c. 31, s. 51 . 678.0.2 .   The second and third paragraphs of article 10 and articles 10.1 to 10.3 apply, adapted as required. The clerk or secretary-treasurer of any local municipality which adopts a resolution, under article 10.1 or 10.2, in order to become subject to or cease to be subject to the jurisdiction of the regional county municipality with respect to the providing of a police service in whole or in part, must transmit an authenticated copy of the resolution to the Minister of Public Security. \n 1987, c. 102, s. 44 ;  1991, c. 32, s. 171 . 678.0.3 .   A regional county municipality which exercises a jurisdiction pursuant to article 678.0.1 shall have, for that purpose, all the powers of every municipality in respect of which it has affirmed its jurisdiction, except that of imposing taxes.  The powers of the regional county municipality shall then exclude the exercise of that jurisdiction from the powers of such municipality.  In that case, the regional county municipality shall be substituted in the rights and obligations of such municipality. The by-laws, resolutions,  proc\u00e8s-verbaux , collection rolls and other instruments of the municipality for which the regional county municipality is substituted, which are relevant to the jurisdiction exercised by the latter under article 678.0.1, remain in force until they are replaced or repealed. Article 616 applies to the contribution of the municipality in respect of a jurisdiction exercised under article 678.0.1. \n 1987, c. 102, s. 44 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 320 ;  1998, c. 31, s. 52 . 678.0.4 .   Where a municipality adopts a resolution pursuant to article 10.1 and article 678.0.2 after the regional county municipality has begun to exercise a jurisdiction under article 678.0.1, article 678.0.3 ceases to apply from the sending of the resolution by registered mail to the regional county municipality.  The instruments of the regional county municipality which are relevant to that jurisdiction and applicable in the territory of the municipality or, as the case may be, applicable to the municipality or to persons in whose respect it exercises jurisdiction, remain in force until they are replaced or repealed. \n 1987, c. 102, s. 44 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1998, c. 31, s. 53 . 678.0.5 .    The Government may, at the request of the council of a regional county municipality designated as a rural regional county municipality, allow the council to affirm, in respect of the municipalities mentioned in the request, the regional county municipality\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to residual materials management, local roads, the management of social housing or the transportation of handicapped persons, and a local municipality may not express its disagreement in relation to the exercise by the regional county municipality of that jurisdiction under articles 678.0.2 and 10.1.  The resolution making the request referred to in the first paragraph shall specify, among the matters mentioned therein, those to which the request applies and, if the regional county municipality wishes to affirm its jurisdiction in part of its territory only, the name of the local municipalities in whose territory the jurisdiction of the regional county municipality to which the request applies will be exercised. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 49 . 678.0.6 .   Where an order under article 678.0.5 is in force in respect of a regional county municipality, the council of that regional county municipality may not affirm its jurisdiction in respect of any of the matters or any of the municipalities covered by the order unless it affirms its jurisdiction in respect of all of such matters and municipalities covered thereunder, and articles 10.1 and 10.2 do not apply in respect of that affirmation of jurisdiction. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 49 . 678.0.7 .   The Government may, at the request of the council of the regional county municipality, amend an order made pursuant to article 678.0.5. However, only a regional county municipality having adopted a by-law under article 10.3 that is in force may make the request referred to in the first paragraph where the request concerns a local municipality\u2019s becoming subject to a jurisdiction exercised by the regional county municipality to which it is not already subject or its ceasing to be subject to such a jurisdiction to which it is subject. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 49 . 678.0.8 .   The Government may, at the request of the council of a regional county municipality designated as a rural regional county municipality, grant such regional county municipality jurisdiction with respect to ( 1 )  \u00a0 the elaboration of a cultural and heritage development policy; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the elaboration of a local tourism development policy; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the financing of the sums which, pursuant to the Act respecting the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019habitation du Qu\u00e9bec (chapter S-8), must be paid by a municipality to its municipal housing bureau in respect of the low-rental housing dwellings referred to in article 1984 of the Civil Code and administered by the bureau; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the determination of the terms and conditions of the management and financing of equipment, infrastructures, services and activities designated as being of supralocal scope. The order may contain any term or condition respecting the exercise of the jurisdiction granted. With respect to the matters referred to in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of the first paragraph, the order may establish the obligations which the local municipalities would be required to discharge for the purpose of implementing the policy adopted by the council of the regional county municipality, or may allow the council of the regional county municipality to establish those obligations. With respect to the matter referred to in subparagraph 4 of the first paragraph, the order may designate any equipment, infrastructure, service or activity mentioned in the request as being of supralocal scope. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 49 . 678.0.9 .   The council of the regional county municipality may, in respect of a jurisdiction granted to it by an order under article 678.0.8, adopt the by-law provided for in article 10.3. The Government may, at the request of the council of a regional county municipality, amend an order made pursuant to article 678.0.8. However, only a regional county municipality having adopted a by-law under article 10.3 that is in force may make such a request where the request concerns a local municipality\u2019s becoming subject to a jurisdiction exercised by the regional county municipality to which it is not already subject or its ceasing to be subject to such a jurisdiction to which it is subject. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 49 . 678.0.10 .   Every request to the Government under any of articles 678.0.5 and 678.0.7 to 678.0.9 shall be addressed to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. The third paragraph of section 188 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1) does not apply in respect of a jurisdiction exercised by a regional county municipality pursuant to article 678.0.5 or 678.0.8. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 49 . 678.1 .   Notwithstanding sections 188 and 205 of the Act respecting land use planning and development ( chapter A-19.1 ), where the council of a regional county municipality authorizes the making of an agreement in view of a twinning of municipalities, any municipality, whether or not governed by this Code, whose representative or the majority of whose representatives, as the case may be, does not give a favourable vote for the making of the agreement shall not share the expenses related to the twinning contemplated in the agreement and its representative is not authorized to take part in the deliberations and subsequent votes on the twinning. The apportionment of the expenses related to the twinning is made in proportion to the standardized property value, within the meaning of section 261.1 of the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F-2.1 ), of each municipality which, subject to the first paragraph, shares the expenses.  The council of the regional county municipality may, however, determine by by-law another criterion of apportionment. \n 1985, c. 27, s. 57 ;  1986, c. 32, s. 7 ;  1991, c. 32, s. 172 ;  1993, c. 65, s. 98 ;  1997, c. 93, s. 86 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 679 .

( 1 )  \u00a0 Every regional county municipality may amend or repeal by-laws to provide: ( a )  \u00a0 for the erection and maintenance of as many registry offices as there are registration divisions in the territory of the regional county municipality; and ( b )  \u00a0 for the erection and maintenance of a building for the Court of Qu\u00e9bec if that court is established in the territory of the regional county municipality, and for furnishing the accessories necessary for holding such court.

Every regional county municipality may, by by-law, determine the location of a regional park, whether or not it is the owner of the right of way of the park.  Its secretary-treasurer shall, before the passage of the by-law, give notice and post it up in accordance with the fourth paragraph of article 445. Such a by-law is without effect as regards third persons as long as the regional county municipality is not the owner of the right of way or has not made an agreement with the owner of the right of way or, in the case of land in the domain of the State, with the person having authority over the land, allowing it to operate the park. For the purposes of this article and articles 688.1 to 688.4, a natural area or a corridor for recreational and sports activities is considered to be a park.

From the coming into force of a by-law under article 688, the regional county municipality may make an agreement with any person holding the right of ownership or any other right in respect of an immovable situated in the park concerned.

The body concerned shall deduct the employees\u2019 contributive shares of the cost of the premium from their salary or remuneration and shall pay them to the municipality at the same time as its own contributive share.  The by-law by which the council integrates the employees of the body concerned must specify the terms and conditions of the integration.

The parties to an agreement contemplated by this article may provide therein that any other local municipality whose territory forms part of that of the regional county municipality may join the agreement. An agreement which provides that it may be joined must determine, or provide a mechanism for determining, all or part of the conditions of joining.  Subject to the Supplemental Pension Plans Act ( chapter R-15.1 ), such conditions are effective notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of any general law or special Act. A local municipality, by resolution of its council, may join an agreement which provides therefor, on the conditions determined by or pursuant to the agreement. A municipality which joins an agreement must transmit to each party to the agreement a copy of the resolution and, where applicable, a statement of the conditions of eligibility not determined in the agreement. The agreement and, if such is the case, the by-law contemplated in article 704, are then deemed amended accordingly. \n 1979, c. 36, s. 42; 1982, c. 63, s. 51 ;  1987, c. 42, s. 8 ;  1989, c. 38, s. 273 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 40 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 333 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 81 . 711 .

For the purposes of section 319 of the said Act, the number of members required shall not be fewer than 10\u00a0% of the membership. Section 404.1 of the said Act applies to a legal person. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.12 .   A legal person may invest its moneys in accordance with the rules contained in the Civil Code as regards investments presumed sound.  It may also invest its moneys in accordance with the second paragraph of article 203 of this Code or paragraph  d  of section 245.0.1 of the Act respecting insurance (chapter A-32). \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.13 .   A director of a legal person need not be a member of the council of a municipality that is a party to the agreement. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.14 .   If the Inspector General is of the opinion that the contributions which the municipalities are required to pay are no longer sufficient, in view of the obligations of the legal person, to maintain assets that exceed its liabilities for an amount equal to or greater than the minimum amount required under section 275 of the Act respecting insurance (chapter A-32), he may order the legal person, after giving it the opportunity to present observations, to increase the contributions by the amount and for the period he determines, so as to cover the operating costs of the legal person. The municipalities are thereupon bound to pay the required contributions. The order is deemed to be an order made under the Act respecting insurance. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1997, c. 43, s. 182 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.15 .   Any municipality may, by a by-law which requires only the approval of the Minister, order a loan to provide for the payment of a contribution. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 . 711.16 .   No member may withdraw from the legal person before the expiry of three years after the date on which it became a member. After the three-year period, the withdrawal of a member is subject to the authorization of the Inspector General. The Inspector General shall grant his authorization ( 1 )  \u00a0 if he considers that the legal person remains financially viable despite the withdrawal; ( 2 )  \u00a0 if the legal person agrees to comply with the conditions he considers necessary for the legal person to remain financially viable despite the withdrawal. If the legal person cannot, in the opinion of the Inspector General, remain financially viable despite the withdrawal or if the legal person refuses to comply with the conditions considered necessary by the Inspector General, the latter shall order the winding-up of the legal person and appoint a liquidator. The Inspector General shall, before ordering the winding-up of the legal person, give it an opportunity to present observations in writing within 30 days after the sending of a notice in which he informs the legal person of his intention to order its winding-up. The order has the same effect as an order rendered by a judge of the Superior Court under section 25 of the Winding-up Act (chapter L-4). Where the Inspector General orders the winding-up of the legal person, he shall deposit a notice to that effect in the register. The provisions of Chapter XI of Title IV of the Act respecting insurance (chapter A-32) also apply, adapted as required, to the winding-up so ordered to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act respecting insurance. This article also applies in cases of expulsion of a member of the legal person. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1993, c. 48, s. 227 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.17 .   The voluntary winding-up of a legal person must be authorized by the Minister. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.18 .   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a legal person is not required, to obtain an insurer\u2019s licence, to undertake to be party to a standard-form contract and to maintain the conditions stated therein with the Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.19 .   The Minister must, between 23 June 1996 and 23 June 1997, report to the Government on the application of the provisions of this Title. The report shall be tabled within the following 15 days before the National Assembly if it is in session or, if it is not sitting, within 15 days following resumption. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 47 . TITLE  XVIII.2 PROTECTION AGAINST CERTAIN FINANCIAL LOSSES RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF MUNICIPAL DUTIES \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.1 .   A municipality shall ( 1 )  \u00a0 assume the defence of a person whose election as member of the council of a municipality is contested or who is the defendant or respondent in judicial proceedings brought before a court by reason of the person\u2019s alleged disqualification for office as a member of the council or as an officer or employee of the municipality or a mandatary body of the municipality; ( 2 )  \u00a0 assume the defence or the representation, as the case may be, of a person who is the defendant, respondent or accused, or the person impleaded in judicial proceedings brought before a court by reason of the person\u2019s alleged act or omission in the performance of his duties as a member of the council or as an officer or employee of the municipality or a mandatary body of the municipality. Where the person assumes, himself or through an attorney of his choice, the defence or representation, the municipality shall pay any reasonable costs incurred therefor.  However, the municipality may, with the consent of the person, reimburse such costs to him instead of paying them. The municipality is exempt from the obligations set out in the first two paragraphs, in a particular case, if the person renounces in writing, in respect of that case, the application of those provisions. For the purposes of this Title, ( 1 )  \u00a0 \u201cmandatary body\u201d means any body declared by law to be the mandatary or agent of the municipality and any body whose council is composed of a majority of members of the council of the municipality, whose budget is adopted by the municipality or more than half of the financing of which is assumed by the municipality; ( 2 )  \u00a0 \u201ccourt\u201d means, in addition to its ordinary meaning, a coroner, a fire investigation commissioner, an inquiry commission or a person or body exercising quasi-judicial functions. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.2 .   The person for whom the municipality is required to incur expenses under article 711.19.1 shall, at the request of the municipality, reimburse all the expenses or the portion of such expenses indicated in the request in any of the following cases: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the person\u2019s alleged act or omission having given rise to the proceedings is a gross or intentional fault or a fault separable from the performance of his duties; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the proceedings are brought before the court by the municipality or by a third person at the request of the municipality; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the person, defendant or accused in the penal or criminal proceedings, has been convicted and had no reasonable grounds to believe that he acted within the law. In addition, where the municipality incurs the expenses referred to in the first paragraph in reimbursing the expenses relating to the person\u2019s defence or representation assumed by the person himself or by an attorney of his choice, the municipality\u2019s obligation shall cease, in respect of all expenses not reimbursed or the portion of such expenses which the municipality may indicate, from the day on which it is established, by the person\u2019s own admission or by a judgment that has become  res judicata , that the request for reimbursement provided for in the first paragraph or the cessation of reimbursement provided for in this paragraph is justified. The first and second paragraphs apply where the municipality is justified in requiring the reimbursement provided for in the first paragraph or, as the case may be, in ceasing to make reimbursements pursuant to the second paragraph. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.3 .   For the purpose of determining whether the justification provided for in the third paragraph of article 711.19.2 exists, the following objectives shall be considered and weighed one against the other: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the person referred to in article 711.19.1 must be reasonably protected against any financial loss which may result from the performance of his duties; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the monies of the municipality must not be used to protect such a person against financial losses resulting from misconduct which cannot possibly be compared with the errors that may reasonably be expected to be committed by a person performing similar duties. For the purposes of the first paragraph, the good or bad faith of the person may be taken into account as well as his diligence or negligence in learning the rules and practices relevant to the performance of his duties, the existence or absence of any previous fault related to the performance of his duties, the simplicity or complexity of the circumstances in which he committed a fault, the good or poor quality of the advice given to him and any other relevant factor. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.4 .   Where the municipality\u2019s right to obtain the reimbursement requested under the first paragraph of article 711.19.2 is contested, article 711.19.1, adapted as required, applies in respect of any judicial recourse exercised by the municipality in order to obtain such reimbursement. The court before which the recourse is exercised shall rule also on the applicability of article 711.19.2 in respect of all or part of the expenses to be incurred by the municipality for the purposes of the first paragraph of this article, as if the grounds for the recourse were the same as those for the original proceedings referred to in article 711.19.1. The court before which the original proceedings referred to in article 711.19.1 are brought, in the case of a court of justice and civil proceedings, may, at the request of the municipality, rule on the applicability of article 711.19.2 in respect of such proceedings.  Where the municipality is not already a party to or impleaded in the proceedings, it may intervene in order to make and support the request. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.5 .   Every municipality shall pay damages owing to a third person which result from the fault of a member of its council in the performance of his duties within the municipality or a mandatary body of the municipality, except in the case of a gross or intentional fault or a fault separable from the performance of such duties, or where the member, without the authorization of the municipality, admits his fault or assumes his defence or representation, during the proceedings in which his fault is proved, himself or through an attorney of his choice. The first paragraph may not be used to establish the fault of a municipality or a mandatary body. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.6 .   Any municipality may, by by-law, provide for the payment of an indemnity, on application, to any person who has suffered material loss in the performance of his duties as a member of the council, officer or employee of the municipality or a mandatary body of the municipality. The by-law must specify the circumstances giving rise to the payment of the indemnity, the amount of the indemnity or the manner of computing that amount, and the time limit for filing an application. The payment of every indemnity must be decided by the council. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.7 .   Any benefit provided by a municipality to or in respect of a person under a provision of this Title in the period throughout which the person is a member of the council of the municipality, or the provision of which is the subject of an application, deliberation or vote during that period is a condition of employment related to the office of member of the council for the purposes of sections 304, 305, 361 and 362 of the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities ( chapter E-2.2 ). For the purposes of any provision relating to the disqualification for office as an officer or employee of a municipality, a benefit referred to in the first paragraph is deemed to be provided for by the contract binding the municipality and the officer or employee to or in respect of whom the benefit is provided. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . 711.19.8 .   Where a provision of a by-law, resolution, contract or collective agreement provides for a benefit that is not as advantageous to the person to or in respect of whom it is provided as the benefit provided for in a provision of this Title, the latter provision shall prevail. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 83 . TITLE  XIX ROADS, BRIDGES AND WATERCOURSES CHAPTER  0.1 MANAGEMENT OF MUNICIPAL ROADS \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 . 711.20 .   This chapter applies to a road, including a front road, which is the property of a municipality and is not under the management of the Minister of Transport. For the purposes of this chapter, a road includes its infrastructure and all the works and installations needed for its improvement and management. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 . 711.21 .   Subject to any agreement, each local municipality is responsible for the management of any road or part of a road situated in its territory. It is bound to carry out the inspection of the bridges for whose maintenance it is responsible. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 . 711.22 .   Where a road is crossed by the common boundary of the territories of two local municipalities, in such a way that responsibility for the management of the parts of the road situated on either side of the boundary must be assumed by the same municipality in order for the road to be maintained in a good state of repair at that place, the municipalities must enter into an agreement to that end in accordance with the Act governing each municipality. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 . 711.23 .   If the municipalities fail to enter into an agreement under article 711.22, either one may request that the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec rule on whether responsibility for the management of the parts of the road situated on either side of the common boundary of the municipal territories need be assumed by the same municipality, and, if necessary, decide which of the municipalities shall have that responsibility and prescribe rules for the apportionment of expenses. The clerk or secretary-treasurer of the municipality making the request must, as soon as possible after the adoption of the resolution setting out the request, forward a certified copy thereof to the other municipality. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 . 711.24 .   Where a request under article 711.23 has been brought before the Commission, it may, after inquiry, either rule that there is no need for the responsibility for the management of the parts of the road situated on either side of the common boundary of the municipal territories to be assumed by the same municipality, or rule that uniform management is necessary, decide which municipality shall be responsible and prescribe rules for the apportionment of expenses. For the purposes of the first paragraph of article 711.21, a decision of the Commission entrusting a municipality with responsibility for the management of a part of a road which is not situated in its territory is considered to be an agreement.  Such a decision retains its effect until the coming into force of an agreement entered into by the municipalities under article 711.22. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 711.25 .   This chapter has precedence over any contrary provision of this Code. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 63 . CHAPTER  I PROVISIONS COMMON TO ROADS, BRIDGES AND WATERCOURSES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE AND THAT OF SIDEWALKS 712 .   Municipal roads and bridges are local roads and bridges. Municipal watercourses are either local or regional watercourses. \n M.C. 1916, a. 444 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 335 . 713 .   Until otherwise provided for under article 715 or 716: ( 1 )  \u00a0 local watercourses are those which are wholly situated in the territory of one local municipality; ( 2 )  \u00a0 regional watercourses are those which divide local municipal territories or which are situated in more than one such territory. A local watercourse is under the jurisdiction of the local municipality in whose territory it is situated, except local watercourses situated in the territory of a regional county municipality designated as a rural regional county municipality which are under the jurisdiction of the regional county municipality.  A regional watercourse is under the jurisdiction of the regional county municipality in whose territory it is situated; however, where the local municipal territories that are divided or linked by a regional watercourse form part of the territories of two or more regional county municipalities, the watercourse is under the joint jurisdiction of all such regional county municipalities. Only a municipality governed by the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19) whose territory does not include any regional watercourse and is not bounded by any such watercourse may exercise, in respect of the powers of the regional county municipality relating to regional watercourses, the right of withdrawal provided for in the third paragraph of section 188 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1). However, in a regional county municipality designated as a rural regional county municipality, no local municipality may exercise such right of withdrawal in respect of those powers. For the purposes of this Title, a watercourse is deemed to belong to any municipality having jurisdiction in respect of the watercourse. For the purposes of this article and of articles 714 to 724, \u201cmunicipality\u201d and \u201clocal municipality\u201d include a municipality governed by the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19). \n M.C. 1916, a. 445 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 336 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 50 . 714 .   Municipal roads, bridges and watercourses are under the control of the municipality to which they belong.  The joint jurisdiction of several regional county municipalities over a watercourse is exercised through the board of delegates. Moreover, all roads, bridges and watercourses are made and maintained under this Code, unless otherwise ordained by a special Act. \n M.C. 1916, a. 446 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 337 . 715 .   The regional county municipality may, by resolution, or in a  proc\u00e8s-verbal , declare: ( 1 )  \u00a0 that a local watercourse in its territory is henceforth a regional watercourse; ( 2 )  \u00a0 that a regional watercourse under its exclusive jurisdiction is henceforth a local watercourse under the jurisdiction of the local municipality whose territory includes the watercourse or is bounded by it. A regional county municipality, after having declared that a local watercourse is henceforth a regional watercourse, may, when occasion requires, determine by by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal , which municipality is responsible for the maintenance of such watercourse, and may declare in such by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal  what proportion each municipality shall contribute. \n M.C. 1916, a. 447; 1934, c. 83, s. 9 ;  1938, c. 103, s. 6 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 338 . 716 .   The board of delegates may likewise, by resolution or in a  proc\u00e8s-verbal , declare: ( 1 )  \u00a0 that a local watercourse situated in the territory of the regional county municipalities represented by the board is henceforth a regional watercourse under the joint jurisdiction of all such regional county municipalities; ( 2 )  \u00a0 that a regional watercourse under the exclusive jurisdiction of any of such regional county municipalities is henceforth under the joint jurisdiction of all such regional county municipalities; ( 3 )  \u00a0 that a regional watercourse under the joint jurisdiction of all such regional county municipalities is henceforth under the exclusive jurisdiction of any one of them; ( 4 )  \u00a0 that a regional watercourse under the joint jurisdiction of all such regional county municipalities is henceforth a local watercourse under the jurisdiction of the local municipality whose territory includes the watercourse or is bounded by it. \n M.C. 1916, a. 448 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 339 . 717 .   When the draining of one or more lands necessitates work both in Qu\u00e9bec and in a neighbouring province, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, upon the application of the municipalities concerned, or of the neighbouring province, may, after an agreement with the latter, designate what work is to be done and order the execution thereof by the persons bound to do same, and, on their refusal to comply with the Minister\u2019s order, may cause the work to be done at their cost if need be. \n 1930-31, c. 117, s. 1; 1962, c. 28, s. 22 ;  1973, c. 22, s. 22; 1979, c. 77, s. 21 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 340 . 718 .   From the date of any declaration made under either article 715 ou 716, the work to be performed on any watercourse, with respect to which the resolution has been passed, is at the sole charge of the municipality responsible for the maintenance of the watercourse, until new provisions are made according to law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 449 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 341 . 719 .   No declaration as mentioned in article 715 or 716 can be made until after a public notice to that end has been given, and as soon as such declaration is made it must be immediately published in the territory of the municipalities interested in or affected by the  proc\u00e8s-verbal , by-law or resolution. \n M.C. 1916, a. 450 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 342 . 720 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 451; 1930-31, c. 118, s. 1 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 343 . 721 .   (Repealed). \n 1924, c. 86, s. 1 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 343 . 722 .   The regional county municipality or the board of delegates possesses and exercises, in regard to any watercourse which is regional by law or by declaration, all the powers of a local municipality. \n 1930-31, c. 118, s. 2 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 344 . 723 .   State lands are not liable to contribute work on municipal roads, bridges or watercourses; and the front roads of such lands are made and maintained as by-roads. Nevertheless, occupants of State lands, with or without occupation licenses or location tickets, are liable for municipal work for the lots they occupy, in the same manner as the owner of any other land. \n M.C. 1916, a. 452 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 724 .   Every municipality is bound to have the roads, bridges, watercourses and sidewalks under its control maintained in the condition required by law, by the  proc\u00e8s-verbaux , by the by-laws and by the deeds of agreement which govern them, under penalty of a fine of not more than $20 for each infraction thereof. It is further responsible for any damage resulting from the non-execution of such  proc\u00e8s-verbaux , by-laws, deeds of agreement or provisions of law, saving its recourse against the ratepayers or officers in default, as the case may be. It is not responsible for damage suffered by any person motoring on an earth road or a road maintained during winter to permit free passage of motor vehicles and other vehicles. If the watercourse is under the control of several regional county municipalities, such municipalities are solidarily liable for the maintenance of such watercourse in the required condition, under the same penalties and responsibilities. No action in damages may be taken against any such municipality, without 15 days\u2019 written notice of such action being given to the secretary-treasurer of the municipality, nor unless it be instituted within six months from the date at which the cause of action arose.  Such notice may be given by registered or certified letter, and must give the name and residence of the claimant, as well as the nature of the damage for which damages are claimed, and must be given within 60 days of the date at which the cause of action arose. Nevertheless, if the municipality repairs such road, bridge, watercourse or sidewalk before the expiration of the time mentioned in the notice, it cannot be prosecuted for the offence, but it is responsible for the costs of the notice. If all the municipal roads, bridges, watercourses or sidewalks, or a portion thereof, at the charge and expense of the ratepayers and situated in the territory of a local municipality, are put at the charge and expense of the municipality under this Code or otherwise, all the obligations imposed upon the ratepayers in respect to such roads, bridges, watercourses or sidewalks, or any part thereof, even before such change, are assumed by the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 453; 1921, c. 107, s. 1 ;  1922 (1st sess.), c. 102, s. 1; 1941, c. 70, s. 1 ;  1952-53, c. 23, s. 5; 1975, c. 83, s. 84 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 252 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 345 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 725 .   Notwithstanding any general law or special Act, no municipality may be held liable for damage resulting from an accident, of which any person is the victim, on the sidewalks, streets or roads, by reason of the snow or ice, unless the claimant establishes that the said accident was caused by the negligence or fault of the said municipality, the court having to take into account the weather conditions. \n 1935, c. 47, s. 3 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 725.1 .   The municipality is not liable for damage caused by the presence of an object on the roadway, whether or not the object comes from a motor vehicle or is projected by a motor vehicle. Neither is it liable for damage caused by the state of the roadway to the tires or to the suspension system of a motor vehicle. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 64 . 725.2 .   The municipality is not liable for damage resulting from the absence of a fence between the right of way of a road or of a front road and contiguous land. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 64 ;  1994, c. 33, s. 40 . 725.3 .   The municipality is not liable for damage caused through the fault of a builder or contractor to whom building, rebuilding or maintenance work has been entrusted, for the entire duration of such work. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 64 ;  1994, c. 33, s. 41 ;  1998, c. 35, s. 23 . 725.4 .   Nothing in articles 725.1 to 725.3 is intended to reduce the scope of the exoneration provided for in the third paragraph of article 724 or in article 725. \n 1992, c. 54, s. 64 . CHAPTER  II PROVISIONS SPECIALLY APPLICABLE TO ROADS DIVISION  I MISCELLANEOUS 726 .   Rural roads are classed as: ( 1 )  \u00a0 earth roads; ( 2 )  \u00a0 gravel roads; ( 3 )  \u00a0 macadamized roads. \n M.C. 1916, a. 454 . 727 .   Earth roads are such as have not been covered with a coating of gravel or macadam. \n M.C. 1916, a. 455 . 728 .   A road is classed as a gravel road when it has received a uniform coating of not less than 22\u00a0cm of gravel for its whole length, and for a width of at least 2\u00a0m, after having the road-bed specially prepared. \n M.C. 1916, a. 456 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 . 729 .   A road is classed as a macadamized road when, instead of gravel, stone broken by a stone-crusher is used, and when the stone has been crowned up and so packed as to form a sort of concrete impervious to rain water. \n M.C. 1916, a. 457 . 730 .   All municipal roads are either front roads or by-roads. Front roads are those whose general course is across the lots in any range, and which do not lead from one range to another in front or in rear thereof. All other municipal roads are by-roads. \n M.C. 1916, a. 458 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 346 . 731 .   Every front road passing between two ranges is the front road of both ranges, unless such road is, by resolution of the council under whose jurisdiction it is situate, declared to be the front road of one of such ranges. \n M.C. 1916, a. 459 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 347 . 732 .   The front road of a lot includes every portion of such road which crosses such lot throughout its breadth, or upon which such lot borders at one or other of its extremities. Whenever a road is the front road of two ranges, the exact half of such road, adjacent to each lot, is the front road of such lot. If the front road of two ranges in any part of its length is diverted, owing to natural obstacles, in such manner that the part of the road so diverted is no longer adjacent to the lots of one of the ranges, the council of the municipality may, by by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal , declare that such part of the road, so diverted, is the front road of the two ranges and must be maintained by the owners of the lots of both ranges, in the proportion determined by the by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 460; 1922 (1st sess.), c. 103, s. 1 ;  1982, c. 2, s. 26 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 348 . 733 .   Any  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or any by-law respecting municipal roads may declare that any new road, or any road already designated or recognized as a by-road, shall for the future be a front road, or that any new road, or any road already designated or recongnized as a front road, shall for the future be a by-road. Every declaration constituting any road whatsoever a front road must, at the same time, set forth the lot of which such road is the front road. \n M.C. 1916, a. 461 . 734 .   In the case of a road which is the front road of two ranges, the municipality may pass a by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal  to divide such road across for the purpose of maintenance, so that each owner or occupant of land shall keep the whole width of the road upon one-half of the breadth of his land, except in cases where the nature of the soil or other obstacles shall render such division unjust; and, in default of agreement between the parties interested respecting such division, the municipal inspector, upon application of one of the parties, must himself make the division. \n M.C. 1916, a. 462 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 735 .   Any municipality may, at its own expense, with moneys levied by direct taxation on all taxable immovable property in the territory of the municipality, or at the expense of anyone liable for such work, have any ford levelled or cleared, or may pave, gravel, macadamize or plank any road or part of a road under its control. As regards the up-keep and maintenance of a macadamized road which comes under the control of a municipality, the municipality, upon application to that effect, may, by resolution or by-law, order that such road shall be kept up and maintained as a macadamized road, and that the work of keeping up such road shall be done by the ratepayers themselves, as indicated in the resolution or by-law, or at their expense, or at the charge and expense of the municipality interested, with moneys levied by direct taxation on all taxable immovable property in the territory of the municipality, but, in every case, under the control of the municipality in whose territory the road in question is situated. \n M.C. 1916, a. 463 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 349 . 736 .   Lands or passages used as roads by the mere permission of the owner or occupant, are municipal roads, if they are fenced on either side, or otherwise divided off from the remaining land, and are not habitually kept closed at their extremities; but the ownership of the land, and the obligation of maintenance, remain, in all cases, with the owner, unless otherwise provided under article 801. The municipality having jurisdiction over such roads may, by resolution, order the owner or occupant to close the same by means of fences or gates, under penalty of a fine of $20 for each day he may neglect or refuse to execute such order. \n M.C. 1916, a. 464 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 350 . 737 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 Public roads under the control of the Government of Canada or the Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec, and turnpike roads governed under letters patent or special Acts, or under the law respecting companies for the construction of roads, do not fall under the direction and control of municipalities. ( 2 )  \u00a0 Roads and bridges built by the Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec in the territory of a local municipality are at the charge of the local municipality, in the same manner as all other roads and bridges. ( 3 )  \u00a0 (Subarticle repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 465; 1962, c. 28, s. 1 ;  1972, c. 54, s. 17 ;  1992, c. 54, s. 65 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 351 . 738 .   The land occupied by any municipal road belongs to the municipality having control of such road, and cannot in any manner be alienated, so long as it is used for such purpose. This article does not apply to the land occupied by a road which leads solely to a ferry or toll-bridge, and which is maintained at the expense of the proprietor of such ferry or toll-bridge. \n M.C. 1916, a. 466 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 739 .   The local municipality may alienate, even gratuitously, the right of way of a road no longer in use or re-use it for any purpose coming under its jurisdiction. Where the value of the right of way that alienated gratuitously is greater than the amount mentioned in paragraph 1.1 of article 6, the alienation shall, notwithstanding its gratuitous character, be entered in the notice provided for in that paragraph with a mention of the gratuitous nature of the alienation instead of the price of alienation. \n M.C. 1916, a. 467 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 84 . 740 .   Municipal roads which existed on 2 November 1871, may retain the width which they now have, although such width be less than required by the law under which such roads were established. \n M.C. 1916, a. 469; 1944, c. 46, s. 5 . 741 .   Every road must have, if required, on each side thereof, a ditch properly made, of sufficient width and with sufficient fall to carry off the water from the road and from the adjoining lands, and as many small drains as are necessary, communicating from one ditch to the other. \n M.C. 1916, a. 470 . 742 .   If, in order to carry off the water from any road, it is necessary to make any watercourse or ditch upon the lands bordering upon such road, such watercourse or ditch is regulated in accordance with article 852, and is constructed and kept in repair, either by the persons liable for road work upon such road, or at their expense, or by the owners or occupants of the lands the water wherefrom flows off or should flow off by such watercourse or ditch, according as it is provided in the  proc\u00e8s-verbal , conformably to article 792, or at the expense of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 471 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 743 .   Ditches, small drains and bridges form part of the municipal roads on which they are situated. Pits, precipices, deep waters and other dangerous places, which must be filled up or protected in such manner as to prevent accidents, likewise form part of the roads on which they are situated. The municipality may, however, order that the work shall be done in whole or in part at the expense of the owners of immovables situated in the whole territory of the municipality or in any part thereof. \n M.C. 1916, a. 472 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 352 . 744 .   The fence dividing the land of a private individual from a municipal road, the maintenance of which is at the expense of the municipality, shall be deemed a boundary fence as between the owner or occupant of such private land and the municipality, saving the case of an express provision to the contrary in a by-law or a  proc\u00e8s-verbal. This article does not apply to a fence dividing a front road from any lot, which fence, when required, remains at the expense of the owner or occupant of the lot; but the establishment of a front road between two ranges in no manner alters the obligations of neighbors, when such road is solely at the charge of one of such ranges. Nevertheless, when the front road of a range is situated, in whole or in part, in another range, the proprietors of the range of which it is the front road are none the less bound to keep it in order. Notwithstanding this article, fences are always subject to the regulation authorized by articles 521, 522 and 627. \n M.C. 1916, a. 473 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 745 .   Upon any road which runs along the line of any lot, one-half of the fence which separates such road from the lot, forms part of the work to be done upon such road. If, however, a by-road divides a lot into two portions, the owner of such lot is not obliged to put up more fencing along such by-road than he was before the establishment thereof; the surplus fencing forms part of the work on the by-road. The proportions of the amount of the fencing to be put up on such roads or by-roads in default of provision therefor in any  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, as the case may be, are determined by the municipal inspector, in such a manner that the position of the neighboring proprietor shall not be more onerous than it was before the establishment of such road or by-road. \n M.C. 1916, a. 474 . 746 .   Every fence required on any municipal road must be well made, and kept in good order according to law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 475 . 747 .   Fords form part of the municipal roads with which they are connected.  If a ford unites two different roads, one half of the ford forms part of the road to which it is adjacent. They must be marked out with balizes ( guide-poles ) and kept at all times free from loose stones and other impediments; and the bottom thereof must be kept as smooth and even as practicable. \n M.C. 1916, a. 476 . 748 .   Shrubbery and weeds, such as daisies, thistles, wild endive, chicory, celandine, orange hawk-weed (paint-brush), and other plants considered noxious, growing upon any municipal road, must be cut down and destroyed between 20 June and 10 July in each year, by the persons liable for the maintenance of such road. Trees must also be pruned during the same period, by the same persons, to a height of 3\u00a0m. \n M.C. 1916, a. 477 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 . 749 .   Every municipal road must, at all times, be kept in good order, free from all holes, cavities, ruts, slopes, stones, incumbrances or impediments whatsoever, with hand-rails at dangerous places, in such manner as to permit of the free passage of vehicles of every description, both by day and night, except in the case mentioned in article 831. Motor vehicles travel at their own risk and peril on earth roads and roads maintained during winter to permit free passage of motor vehicles and other vehicles. The side-walks must also be kept in good repair, free from all holes, obstacles and impediments whatsoever, with hand-rails at dangerous places. \n M.C. 1916, a. 478; 1922 (1st sess.), c. 102, s. 2 ;  1952-53, c. 23, s. 6 . 750 .   Every person who, without reason or authority, cuts, mutilates or injures any trees planted or preserved for ornament on any municipal road, or any posts, inscriptions, works, or objects forming part of, or connected with any municipal road, is responsible for all damage occasioned thereby, and further incurs a fine of not less than $5 nor more than $10. \n M.C. 1916, a. 479 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . DIVISION  II WINTER ROADS \u00a7  1 . \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 General Provisions 751 .   Winter roads are laid out before 1 December in each year, in the places fixed by the municipal inspector, in accordance always with the orders of the council, if the latter sees fit to give any. The line thereof is marked by means of balizes, of at least 1,50\u00a0m in height, fixed in the ground at each side of the road, at a distance of not more than 11\u00a0m one from the other, on each line.  If the road is laid down with two tracks, a row of balizes must be fixed in a similar manner between the two tracks. Front roads are laid out by the persons who are liable for the work on such roads, and by-roads by the municipal inspector. Notwithstanding this article, a municipality may, by by-law, exempt itself from opening or maintaining a winter road, leading to uninhabited properties only, between 1 January and 1 April. \n M.C. 1916, a. 480; 1935, c. 110, s. 1 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 752 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 The municipality under whose control any road whatsoever falls, may, by resolution, order that such road be, during the winter, laid out and kept in repair as a double road; one track thereof to be for vehicles going in one direction, and the other for vehicles going in the opposite direction. ( 2 )  \u00a0 The municipality may also, by by-law, order that such road be maintained in winter, for traffic by motor vehicles, organize such service as the council considers appropriate in each case and determine, when it considers it expedient to do so, that snow be blown onto or deposited on private land, provided it also determines the necessary precautions in such cases to prevent damage to persons and property. To pay the cost of such service, the municipality may impose and collect a tax on the real property of the proprietors bordering on any road, group of roads or parts of roads, based either on the municipal valuation of the lands or buildings, on the total area of a lot or on the frontage of the lots. In the apportionment of that cost, the portion that would be payable for the immovables exempt from all property tax may be charged to the whole of the taxable real property in the territory of the municipality and based on the municipal valuation of such property. The tax for such service may be fixed in advance and collected at the same time as the general property tax or be equivalent to the real cost of the service, including the management and financial expenses, and be claimed as soon as that cost is determined. ( 3 )  \u00a0 (Subarticle repealed). ( 4 )  \u00a0 In default of an order of the municipality, a double track of 7,50\u00a0m in length, at distances not more than 225\u00a0m from one another, must be made and maintained on every municipal winter road. \n M.C. 1916, a. 481; 1951-52, c. 61, s. 5 ;  1979, c. 36, s. 44 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 353 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 753 .   Every person placing balizes on a summer road, after the road which must be substituted therefor in winter has been laid out beyond the limits of such road, or displacing balizes already placed, incurs a fine of not more than $8. \n M.C. 1916, a. 482 . 754 .   No winter road, if there is a single track, shall be less than 2,25\u00a0m in width, between the two rows of balizes.  If it is a double road, each track must be at least 1,50\u00a0m in width.  It is, however, lawful for municipalities to make and enact by-laws providing that certain winter roads be laid out and maintained at a lesser or greater width than 2,25\u00a0m, and fixing different widths for different roads. \n M.C. 1916, a. 483 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 755 .   Whenever the municipal inspector deems it necessary, every owner or occupant of land on a front road, and every person interested in a by-road must, between 1 December in each year and 1 April following, keep all fences erected by the side of municipal roads, and all fences forming an angle with the fences of such roads, to a distance of 7,50\u00a0m, levelled to within 60\u00a0cm of the ground. This provision does not apply to hedges, picket fences more than 7,50\u00a0m distant from the road, nor to those which cannot be taken down or put up again without great expense, nor to fences erected in the woods. Nevertheless, the owners or occupants of land who maintain the fences along any front road, not being that on which they are obliged to work, must pay to the person bound to maintain such road, the excess of work occasioned by the fact that, as such fence cannot be taken down, the person liable for the work on such road has additional labour. When fences have been so taken down, the municipal inspector may compel the same persons to put them up again, at such time as he shall fix. \n M.C. 1916, a. 484 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 354 . 756 .   The municipal inspector may, in all cases where he deems it necessary, authorize the erection of snow guards along winter roads and on adjacent lands, but at suitable places and so as not to cause damage and so as to avoid, in so far as is possible, any inconvenience to the owners or occupants of such lands.  In no case shall snow guards be placed in front of houses or other buildings or in front of yards, passageways or roads giving egress from such lands. \n 1943, c. 48, s. 3 . 757 .   Every municipality may, by resolution, give such orders as it deems proper respecting the maintenance of the winter roads under its control.  Such orders are binding upon the officers of the municipality, and upon all parties interested in the work upon the road to which they relate. \n M.C. 1916, a. 485 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 758 .   Upon the petition in writing of the majority of the proprietors of immovable property in any range or part of a range, the municipality may, by by-law, order that the front road of the range, or of the part of the range, described in the petition, be maintained by means of a roller or other machine described in the petition. The work so ordered shall be paid for by means of a contribution in money levied by special apportionment made by the secretary-treasurer of the municipality in the ordinary manner, and based upon the value of the immovables liable for such work, or according to the superficial extent of the land, as entered upon the valuation roll in force, in conformity with the decision of the corporation. Every year such work is given out to the persons and in the manner provided for by article 888. \n M.C. 1916, a. 486 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 759 .   Every municipality has the power, on complying with the formalities prescribed in chapter VI of this Title, to determine, by by-law or by  proc\u00e8s-verbal , by whom and at whose cost the winter roads shall be maintained. In the absence of a by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal  indicating the persons bound for the maintenance of a winter road, articles 882 to 890, shall apply.  But if any by-road, leading solely to any ferry or toll-bridge, the road work of which is at the charge of the owner or occupant of such ferry or toll-bridge, serves in winter as a passage to any other public road, the work of maintaining such by-road or the road which is substituted therefor, is not, during the winter, at the charge of such owner or occupant, but is performed in the same manner as that of any other by-road. \n M.C. 1916, a. 487; 1922 (2nd sess.), c. 86, s. 1 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 760 .   Every municipality is forbidden to prohibit the use, during the winter, of vehicles with a dragging shaft or tongue ( voitures \u00e0 travail ou timon trainant ), in the mountain roads as well as in roads with a grade, affording a means of communication between the wooded lands and the highways and used principally for the transporting of timber. The by-laws or resolutions which enact such a prohibition shall be null and cannot come into force, and those passed before 29 December 1922, shall cease to be in force from and after such date; no penal proceedings may be instituted for an offence under any of those provisions. \n 1922 (2nd sess.), c. 87, s. 1 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 253 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 355 . \u00a7  2 . \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Winter Roads substituted for Summer municipal Roads 761 .   Winter roads may be laid out beyond the lines of a summer road, across any field, enclosure or standing timber or any lake, river or watercourse.  If the proprietor of such land suffers damage, he shall be indemnified therefor by the municipality.  If the municipality and the proprietor come to an understanding thereon, the amount agreed upon is paid; if they do not, the municipality has the damage assessed by the municipal assessors, and the municipality shall always have its recourse against the persons interested in the road for the reimbursement of the money spent. Such roads cannot, however, without the consent of the proprietor or occupant, be laid out through gardens, orchards, yards or other lands enclosed within hedges, or fences which cannot be taken down or replaced without incurring heavy expense. The municipality may also, by resolution, allow the opening of winter roads across any field or through any wood, for hauling logs, square timber or cord-wood, provided that a written notice of eight days has been given to every owner of land traversed, and that it be done without causing damage, and by complying with the restrictions contained in this article. \n M.C. 1916, a. 488; 1919, c. 87, s. 1 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 20 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 356 . 762 .   Winter roads which are substituted for municipal summer roads are maintained by the persons who in summer are bound to perform work on the roads for which the former are substituted, or by the municipality itself when such roads are at its charge, except in the case mentioned in article 759. \n M.C. 1916, a. 489 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . \u00a7  3 . \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Watercourse Winter Roads \n 1996, c. 2, s. 357 . 763 .   Where the territories of two local municipalities, by whatever law each be governed, are divided by a body of water and one of the local municipalities wishes to have a road established in winter on such body of water to connect the territories, the municipalities shall, in accordance with the Act governing each municipality, enter into an agreement to that end in which is determined the share of the responsibility of each municipality with respect to the management of the road. \n M.C. 1916, a. 490 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 358 . 764 .   If the municipalities fail to enter into an agreement under article 763, either one may request that the Commission municipale du Qu\u00e9bec rule on whether it is necessary to build a winter road and, where applicable, determine the share of responsibility of each municipality with respect to the management of the road and prescribe rules for the apportionment of expenses. The clerk or the secretary-treasurer of the municipality making the request shall, as soon as possible after the adoption of the resolution setting out the request, forward a certified copy thereof to the other municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 491 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 358 . 765 .   Where a request under article 764 has been brought before the Commission, it may, after inquiry, either rule that there is no need to establish a winter road, or rule that such a road is needed and determine the share of responsibility of each municipality with respect to the management of the road and prescribe rules for the apportionment of expenses. Such decision remains in effect until the coming into force of an agreement entered into by the municipalities under article 763. \n M.C. 1916, a. 492 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 358 . 766 .   (Replaced). \n M.C. 1916, a. 493 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 358 . 767 .   (Replaced). \n M.C. 1916, a. 494 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 358 . 768 .

CHAPTER  III PROVISIONS SPECIALLY APPLICABLE TO MUNICIPAL WATERCOURSES 773 .   Every watercourse draining several pieces of land, with the exception of road and boundary ditches, which drain only the two properties between which they are situated, is governed according to this Title. \n M.C. 1916, a. 499; 1941, c. 70, s. 2 . 774 .   Every river or natural watercourse, in the parts thereof which are neither navigable nor floatable, even the parts situated in the territory of a municipality governed by the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19), is a municipal watercourse. A river or natural watercourse, which is floatable only at certain periods of the year or after rains, does not cease to be a municipal watercourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 500; 1941, c. 70, s. 3 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 51 . 775 .   Every municipal watercourse allows of a right of way on foot, by vehicle and with machines over any land in order to have access to the watercourse and to there carry out the work required by the law, the deeds of agreement, the  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  or the by-laws, subject to the indemnification contemplated in article 837 for the damage occasioned. Any public servant authorized by a Federal or Provincial Department, or any municipal inspector may, himself or through other persons under his direction, exercise such right of way. Every person who prevents or attempts to prevent the exercise of such right shall incur the penalties contemplated in article 173. \n 1941, c. 70, s. 4 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 776 .   Municipal watercourses may be regulated, wholly or in part, by  proc\u00e8s-verbal , by-law or deed of agreement. \n M.C. 1916, a. 501; 1941, c. 70, s. 5 . 777 .   Every deed of agreement shall set forth: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the description and situation of the watercourse; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the specification describing the work to be done; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the mode of contributing to the work; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the description and superficial extent of the lands which are to be subjected thereto. When the deed of agreement is accompanied by a plan of the watercourse and a specification of the work to be done, it shall be sufficient to state that the watercourse will be made according to the plan and specification annexed to the deed of agreement to form an integral part thereof. \n M.C. 1916, a. 502; 1930, c. 107, s. 1 ;  1941, c. 70, s. 5 . 778 .   A deed of agreement may be made by deed in notarial form or under private signature, signed by the owners of at least three-fourths in area of the land subjected to the work to be done, and shall be obligatory as well for the persons who have not signed it as for those who have, and for the representatives of both. \n 1930, c. 107, s. 2; 1941, c. 70, s. 5 . 779 .   Every deed of agreement must, on pain of absolute nullity, be homologated by the municipal council or the board of delegates under whose direction the watercourse is. When the deed of agreement has not been signed by all the proprietors of lands subjected to the watercourse, the secretary of the municipal council or of the board of delegates in whose office the deed of agreement is deposited shall be bound to summon the persons interested who have not signed it to the sitting of the council or of the board of delegates at which the deed of agreement is to be considered.  Such summoning shall be effected by a public notice and by registered or certified letter mailed to the last known address of the said persons interested or served upon each of them, at least eight days before the said sitting. \n M.C. 1916, a. 503; 1930, c. 107, s. 3 ;  1941, c. 70, s. 5; 1975, c. 83, s. 84 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 780 .   The deed of agreement is substituted  de jure  for the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, governing such watercourse, if any.  It remains binding until it is replaced by a  proc\u00e8s-verbal , a by-law or a subsequent deed of agreement. \n 1941, c. 70, s. 6 . 781 .   A copy of every deed of agreement must be deposited in the office of the local municipality in whose territory the watercourse governed by such deed is situated, either in whole or in part. \n M.C. 1916, a. 504 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 359 . 782 .   Subject to article 831, municipal watercourses must be kept in good order and free from any obstruction which prevents or impedes the water from flowing, for the whole period between 1 May and 31 October following. \n M.C. 1916, a. 505 . 783 .   Every proprietor of land which is crossed or bordered by a watercourse must keep the approaches to such watercourse free of injurious vegetation, accumulations of branches or other waste matter for a distance of 4,50\u00a0m from the bank of the watercourse. \n 1941, c. 70, s. 7 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 . 784 .   No person is bound to perform work upon any municipal watercourse between 1 November in each year and 30 April following, both days inclusive, except on the order of the municipal inspector, when such watercourse is obstructed by snow or ice or otherwise. \n M.C. 1916, a. 506 . 785 .   In cases when the work is not done by the labour of the ratepayers, the municipal inspector must, at the time when the watercourses should be open and clear, whenever he is called upon so to do, remove or cause to be removed the obstructions caused by snow or ice or otherwise; and the cost of such work is paid by the interested parties mentioned in the by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 507 . 786 .   The municipality may, by resolution duly published, alter the dates mentioned in articles 782 and 784. \n M.C. 1916, a. 508 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 787 .   Whoever obstructs any municipal watercourse or allows it to remain obstructed in any manner, after the expiration of two days from the receipt of a written or verbal notice having for object the removal of such obstruction, given by or on behalf of any interested person, incurs, over and above the damages occasioned, a fine of not more than $1 for every day such obstruction remains. \n M.C. 1916, a. 509 . 788 .   No municipality or board of delegates may, by itself or by its officers, direct the demolition of any dam, dyke, or flood-gate of any mill or factory whatsoever, on the ground that such dam, dyke, or flood-gate is an obstruction to a watercourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 510 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 789 .   The owner or occupant of any low or swampy land may make a watercourse through any neighboring land, or avail himself of those which are already made, deepen the same if they are not deep enough, and repair and keep them in order, in so far as necessary for the drainage of such low or swampy land. The work to be done on such watercourse may be determined by by-law,  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by deed of agreement. \n M.C. 1916, a. 512 . 790 .   The municipal inspector may authorize the opening of any trench or excavation in any public road, to allow a watercourse to pass through the same. Such trench or excavation must be indicated, both by day and night, in such a manner as to prevent accident, under penalty of the damages occasioned. Within 48 hours after the commencement of the work upon the road, a suitable and solid bridge or culvert of the width of the road must be built over such watercourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 513 . 791 .   The waters of any municipal watercourse may be turned into any other municipal watercourse, if so ordered by a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, as the case may be, without such watercourses being considered as a single one on account of their junction. \n M.C. 1916, a. 514 . 792 .   Any land situated within the drainage area of a municipal watercourse may be subjected to the work on such watercourse by a  proc\u00e8s-verbal , a by-law or a deed of agreement for and by reason of the area of such land and in the proportion established by the competent authority; but should an error of not more than 10 percent in the area of such land be made, such error is not to be taken into account.  Such land need not be described otherwise than by indicating its area and by the official number of the lot. The description so given in any  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law in existence on 9 January 1897, is declared sufficient, without prejudice, however, to cases then pending. \n M.C. 1916, a. 515; 1941, c. 70, s. 9 . 793 .   (Repealed). \n 1942, c. 69, s. 4 ;  1986, c. 32, s. 13 . 794 .   Any person may use any municipal watercourse as well as the banks thereof, for the conveyance of all kinds of timber or wood, and for the passage of all boats, ferry-boats, and canoes, subject always to the obligation of repairing, without delay, all fences, drains or ditches damaged thereby, and to the payment of all damages occasioned by the exercise of such right. \n M.C. 1916, a. 516 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . CHAPTER  IV BY-LAWS GOVERNING ROADS, BRIDGES AND WATERCOURSES GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR OTHER WORK 795 .   All work to be performed on municipal roads, bridges or watercourses is governed and determined by by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal  except in cases otherwise provided for, and is performed under the control of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 517; 1941, c. 70, s. 10 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 796 .   The opening, construction, enlargement, alteration, change of direction, division or maintenance of any such road, bridge or watercourse must likewise, in the discretion of the council, be ordered by by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal , except in cases otherwise provided for. \n M.C. 1916, a. 518 . 797 .   The closing, abolition or demolition of any road, bridge or watercourse is ordered in the same manner. \n M.C. 1916, a. 519 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 360 . 798 .   Such a by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal  is adopted or homologated by the municipality or the board of delegates having jurisdiction over the roads, bridges or watercourses in question, by following the formalities prescribed in Chapter VI of this Title (articles 852 to 871). \n M.C. 1916, a. 520 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 799 .   The work ordered by law, by  proc\u00e8s-verbal , or by by-law, or otherwise provided for, as the case may be, upon any municipal road, bridge or watercourse, is performed: ( 1 )  \u00a0 by the ratepayers made liable therefor under a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law in force, or, in the absence of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, under any provision of law; or ( 2 )  \u00a0 according to the rules laid down in article 888, or articles 934 to 953, if so ordered by the  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  or by-laws governing them, or by the municipality; or ( 3 )  \u00a0 by the local municipality, in whole or in part, if a by-law to that effect has been passed under articles 800 and following. \n M.C. 1916, a. 521 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 800 .   Every local municipality may order that all municipal roads, bridges and watercourses, whether local or, in the case of watercourses, regional, for which the ratepayers are liable and which are situated in its territory, shall be made, built, improved, repaired, and maintained or be maintained only by the municipality and at its expense out of moneys levied by means of direct taxation for such purpose on all the taxable property in its territory. The municipality may, however, except and leave at the charge of the persons who are bound to do work thereon, front roads as well as roads or bridges leading exclusively to ferries or toll-bridges, front roads ditches, and watercourses. The municipality may also except and leave at the charge of the proprietors and of the persons, who are bound to do the work thereon, the maintenance of the winter roads. The municipality may enact that the ratepayers or a category of them shall be indemnified, to the extent and in the manner it may determine, for work done in the past by them and their  auteurs  or at their cost and at that of their  auteurs. This article does not apply to the roads referred to in article 736. No by-law under this article shall come into force until 1 January following its publication. However, the Government may, at the request of the council, order the coming into force of the by-law on an earlier date than that fixed by the sixth paragraph but later than the one hundred and twentieth day after its publication. \n M.C. 1916, a. 522; 1921, c. 108, s. 1 ;  1922 (2nd sess.), c. 86, s. 2; 1925, c. 36, s. 11 ;  1948, c. 49, s. 4; 1951-52, c. 62, s. 1 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 52 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 361 . 801 .   Every local municipality may likewise, on a petition from the majority of the ratepayers, interested in certain works, order what work on municipal roads, bridges or watercourses, whether local or, in the case of watercourses, regional, for which such ratepayers are liable, or even at the charge of the municipality and situated in its territory, shall be performed by the municipality at the expense of the ratepayers therein mentioned, and what work shall be performed by and at the charge and expense of the municipality. A special tax is then imposed for the performance of the work, on the immovable property of the ratepayers interested or, at the discretion of the council, on that of the ratepayers who have signed the petition. The other work at the charge and expense of the municipality is paid for with moneys levied by direct taxation on the taxable immovable property other than that upon which the special tax above mentioned has already been imposed. No by-law under this article may come into force until 1 January following its publication. The Government may, however, at the request of the council, order the coming into force of the by-law on an earlier date than that which is fixed in this article but subsequent to the one hundred and twentieth day following its publication. \n M.C. 1916, a. 523; 1951-52, c. 62, s. 2 ;  1983, c. 57, s. 23 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 362 . 802 .   From the coming into force of any by-law passed under article 800 or 801, or otherwise, and placing all or any work on roads, bridges or watercourses at the charge and expense of the local municipality, and so long as such by-law is in force: ( 1 )  \u00a0 no ratepayer is liable for work on the roads, bridges or watercourses so placed at the charge and expense of the municipality, and such municipality is substituted in the place and stead of the ratepayers in all obligations in respect of such works, whether they proceed from  proc\u00e8s-verbaux , by-laws or provisions of law, under the penalties and responsibilities mentioned in article 724; ( 2 )  \u00a0 every part of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law which determines the work to be done, the manner of doing it, the nature and quality of the work, and the duties of the officers entrusted with such work, remains in force and is binding upon the municipality or the ratepayers, as the case may be; the other parts of the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or of the by-law are suspended, and shall not again come into force until after repeal of the by-law putting any or all work at the charge and expense of the municipality or of the ratepayers, as the case may be. \n M.C. 1916, a. 525; 1951-52, c. 61, s. 6 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 803 .   Every municipality may, by resolution, define the manner in which the money levied for the work for which it is liable is to be expended and applied in its territory. It may likewise, for the performance of such work, make any contracts it thinks proper in conformity with article 888 or articles 934 to 953. \n M.C. 1916, a. 526 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 363 . 804 .   No by-law passed under article 800 or 801, or otherwise, placing all or part of the works at the charge and expense of the municipality, may be repealed except by another by-law passed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the council, nor may the by-law come into into force until 1 January following its publication. \n M.C. 1916, a. 527; 1951-52, c. 61, s. 7 ;  1983, c. 57, s. 24 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 805 .   If the work has been given out by contract, the contractor is liable to the same obligations and penalties as are the municipalities which are responsible for the work for which he has contracted, and he is their surety for all damages, penalties and costs which they may be called upon to pay, in default of the work being performed. \n M.C. 1916, a. 528 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 806 .   Any ratepayer may be made liable for any work on a municipal road or bridge by a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by a by-law, by reason of the taxable immovable property he owns or occupies. Article 792 governs the responsibility of ratepayers who are liable for work on watercourses. Nevertheless, no ratepayer of a local municipality is liable for any work on any road, bridge or watercourse situated in a neighbouring local municipal territory unless the watercourse is a regional watercourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 529 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 364 . 807 .   Whenever any lot or piece of land has been divided between several owners or occupants, after the passing of a by-law or the drawing up of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  under which such lot or piece of land is liable for work upon any municipal road, bridge or watercourse, all the owners or occupants of the lot or piece of land so divided are jointly and severally liable, saving to each his recourse against the others in proportion to the value of the land occupied, for the work ordered by the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, until otherwise ordered by a subsequent  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 530 . 808 .   The work on all the by-roads of the territory of the municipality in general, or on any particular by-road, to be performed by the labor of the persons liable for such work, is divided either in proportion to the superficial extent of such land, by reason whereof such persons are liable for such by-road, or in proportion to the value of such land, according to the decision of the council of the municipality. The by-laws and  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  regarding the work to be performed, according to the area of the land, in force on 27 May 1882, and which have not since been repealed, remain in force until they are repealed or amended. \n M.C. 1916, a. 531 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 365 . 809 .   Every person bound to supply materials, or perform work upon municipal roads, bridges, or watercourses, or upon sidewalks, or other work, is in default to fulfil such obligations, from the time when the by-law, resolution,  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or act of apportionment, prescribing the performance of such work or the supplying of such materials, comes into force, without any special or public notice being requisite, except in the case of work to be performed in common. \n M.C. 1916, a. 532 . 810 .   Persons liable to perform work required by any provision of law, of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or of a by-law, are always in default to perform such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 533 . CHAPTER  V PERFORMANCE AND SUPERINTENDENCE OF WORK ON ROADS, SIDEWALKS, BRIDGES AND WATERCOURSES MUNICIPAL INSPECTORS AND DIVISIONAL ROAD INSPECTORS, AND THEIR DUTIES 811 .   The officer whose duty it is to see that the provisions of law, of by-laws or of  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  concerning and regulating municipal roads, sidewalks, bridges or watercourses, whether local or, in the case of watercourses, regional, are carried out, is called \u201cmunicipal inspector\u201d or \u201cdivisional road inspector\u201d, according as the local municipality avails itself of the right of choice authorized by articles 219, 221, 222 and 223. \n M.C. 1916, a. 534 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 366 . 812 .   Every divisional road inspector, when a municipal inspector has been appointed in conformity with article 221, is under the control and supervision of such officer, as mentioned in said article. \n M.C. 1916, a. 535 . 813 .   Whenever the municipal inspector is for any reason whatever unable to discharge his duties, the local council or the mayor must appoint a person to replace him during such inability. Such inspector is not discharged from his responsibility because of such appointment. \n M.C. 1916, a. 536 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 814 .   Upon recommendation of the municipal inspector, the council must employ the services of an expert in such work to assist him in the execution of the work under his superintendence. The council may also, of its own motion and when it believes it necessary, associate an expert in such work with the municipal inspector for the performance of certain work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 537 . 815 .   The municipal inspector is bound to superintend all work of construction, improvement, repair and maintenance on municipal roads, sidewalks, bridges and watercourses situated in the territory of the municipality, whether local or, in the case of watercourses, regional, and to see that such work is performed in conformity with the provisions of law, of  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  or of by-laws governing the same. Ferries are also under the superintendence of the municipal inspector. \n M.C. 1916, a. 538 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 367 . 816 .   Any work of construction, improvement, repair or maintenance on roads or bridges may be performed under the direction of a supervisor appointed by the Minister of Transport. Such supervisor shall not be subject to the control or superintendence of the municipal inspector nor to the control or superintendence of the road inspector for the district where the work is being done.  He shall receive from the municipality the remuneration fixed by the Minister of Transport. \n 1919, c. 83, s. 2; 1972, c. 54, s. 32 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 817 .   The municipal inspector, at the expense of the municipality, makes or causes to be made, in the snow or ice, trenches and all other works which are required to prevent floods and to facilitate the drainage of water. \n M.C. 1916, a. 539 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 818 .   Every municipal inspector has jurisdiction over every person liable to perform the work under his superintendence, whatever such person\u2019s domicile may be. \n M.C. 1916, a. 540 . 819 .   The municipal inspector is considered to be an officer of the regional county municipality in relation to regional work whereof he has the superintendence. \n M.C. 1916, a. 541 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 368 . 820 .   Whenever a municipal inspector is personally interested in any work or other matter within his jurisdiction, and neglects or refuses to execute or supply that which he is bound to execute or supply, by reason of his interest in such work or matter, the secretary-treasurer of the local municipality in whose territory such inspector has jurisdiction, possesses the same rights and powers and is subject to the same obligations in relation to such inspector as the latter possesses and is subject to, in relation to all persons interested in the same work or matter. In respect of work to be performed in common, the inspector so interested is always in default to discharge the obligations attaching to such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 542 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 369 . 821 .   Whenever any work must be performed in common upon any municipal road, bridge, or watercourse, it is the duty of the municipal inspector to notify the persons who are liable to perform such work, either by special, verbal or written notice, or by public notice, of three days: ( 1 )  \u00a0 of the time and place where such work must be performed; ( 2 )  \u00a0 of the quantity and description of materials which are required, and of the time when and place where they must be provided; ( 3 )  \u00a0 of the amount of labour which each must contribute; ( 4 )  \u00a0 of the description of tools and implements required, which must be of the kind ordinarily used by farmers in the territory of the municipality. If the work to be performed in common is, however, not sufficient, in the opinion of the council, to justify the making of a call upon the ratepayers interested, the municipal inspector may cause such work to be performed and the costs thereof to be paid in equal proportions by the ratepayers interested in such work, together with the costs of collection, which shall be taxed by the council. \n M.C. 1916, a. 543 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 370 . 822 .   If the nature of the work requires it, the municipal inspector may call upon each of such persons to bring or to cause to be brought a certain number of horses or oxen, with proper harness, carts or ploughs, if he has them. Every day\u2019s labour of a horse or yoke of oxen, with harness, carts or ploughs, is credited to the person who brought the same, as one day\u2019s work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 544 . 823 .   It is the duty of the municipal inspector: ( 1 )  \u00a0 to direct and superintend the performance of all work; ( 2 )  \u00a0 to fix the hour of commencing and leaving off such labour, and the time for rest and meals, so that the day may consist of 10 clear hours of labour on the spot where the work is to be done; ( 3 )  \u00a0 to dismiss any person who is idle, who hinders the others from working, or who refuses to obey his orders. He may at once replace any person who has not attended at the hour appointed for labour, or who has been dismissed, at the cost of the person so in default. \n M.C. 1916, a. 545 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 254 . 824 .   Every municipal inspector incurs, in addition to damages, a fine of $2 for each day on which he is in default, when he refuses or neglects, without reasonable cause: ( 1 )  \u00a0 to perform any duty which is imposed upon him by the provisions of this Code, or by by-law, or which is required of him under any of such provisions; or ( 2 )  \u00a0 to obey the orders of the council, in respect of the work under his superintendence. \n M.C. 1916, a. 546 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 371 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 825 .   The municipal inspector must, on resolution of the local municipality to that effect, procure and keep in good order, a snow-plough, a roller, an iron or steel-shod scraper or other implements to be used on the municipal roads. Every person who is bound to perform work on municipal roads may be compelled by the municipal inspector to make use of such implements as part of the road work he is bound to perform. The use of such implements may be gratuitous, and the outlay incurred for their purchase and repair falls upon the local municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 547 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 826 .   Any municipality may, on mere resolution, and without any other formality: ( 1 )  \u00a0 acquire stone-crushers, rollers or other machines to construct, improve and maintain roads; ( 2 )  \u00a0 make arrangements with the local municipalities with a population of less than 4\u00a0000 inhabitants and whose territory is included in that of the same regional county municipality for the purpose of allowing them the use of such machines for their roads, and fix the price for their use, or give them the gratuitous use thereof; ( 3 )  \u00a0 acquire such machines jointly with the municipalities mentioned in paragraph 2, and make with them all necessary arrangements for the care, use and repair of such machines. \n M.C. 1916, a. 548; 1982, c. 2, s. 27 ;  1983, c. 57, s. 25 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 372 . 827 .   The municipal inspector is the custodian and depositary of all tools, implements and machines, and of all materials belonging to the municipality; he is responsible to the municipality for their care and preservation, saving his recourse against any person at fault. He has no right to loan to any person whomsoever, any of the tools, implements, machines or other effects belonging to the municipality, except as mentioned in articles 825 and 826. \n M.C. 1916, a. 549 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 828 .   The municipal inspector must, forthwith, or at the expiration of the time granted in cases which come under the provisions of article 831, see to the removal or suppression of all obstructions and nuisances from the municipal roads, sidewalks, ferries, bridges or watercourses within his jurisdiction, by the persons who have occasioned them, or, in the event of their refusal or neglect, by any other person whom he authorizes so to do, at the cost of the person in default. Such costs are recovered by an ordinary action instituted by the municipal inspector in his official capacity, and the local municipality is liable therefor, if the person in default is without means. If the person who occasioned such obstruction or nuisance is unknown, it must be removed at the expense of the local municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 550 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 829 .   The following are deemed obstructions or nuisances: ( 1 )  \u00a0 filth, dead animals, or other objects placed or left on any municipal road or bridge, or in any watercourse or ditch connected with such road or bridge; ( 2 )  \u00a0 any trench or opening made in any municipal road; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the anchoring or mooring of any vessel, boat or other floating object, at the landing place of any ferry, so as to impede free access to the beach or to a wharf. \n M.C. 1916, a. 551 . 830 .   Whoever has committed any act which may have the effect of obstructing, impeding or rendering inconvenient the free passage of vehicles or foot-passengers over any part of a municipal road, sidewalk or bridge, or of impeding the flow of water in connection therewith, is deemed to have occasioned an obstruction or nuisance within the meaning of articles 828 and 829. \n M.C. 1916, a. 552 . 831 .   Nevertheless, the municipal inspector may, upon such conditions as he deems advisable, and whenever it appears expedient to him, permit upon any road, ford, ferry, sidewalk, bridge or watercourse, which is under the control of the municipality, the performance of any work which may have the effect of obstructing, impeding or rendering inconvenient the passing over such road, ford, ferry, sidewalk, bridge or watercourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 553 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 832 .   Whenever any such duly authorized work is in course of performance, as mentioned in article 831, excavations and other dangerous places must be indicated, both by day and night, in such a manner as to prevent accident, under penalty of a fine of not more than $20 for each day during which this article is contravened, in addition to the damages occasioned thereby. \n M.C. 1916, a. 554 . 833 .   Whoever causes any obstruction or nuisance on any municipal road, ford, sidewalk, ferry, bridge or watercourse, or renders the use thereof difficult or dangerous, incurs for each offence, over and above the damages occasioned thereby, a fine of not less than $2 nor more than $10. \n M.C. 1916, a. 555 . 834 .   The municipal inspector must, without delay, report to the municipality respecting any encroachment on any road, sidewalk, bridge, watercourse or other public work under his superintendence. \n M.C. 1916, a. 556 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 835 .   Every municipal inspector, and every person who accompanies him, or who is authorized by him in writing, may in the daytime, without previous notice, enter upon any land whatever, whether occupied or unoccupied, enclosed or unenclosed, for the purpose of making a survey for any road, bridge or watercourse, or upon any unoccupied land, for the purpose of searching for timber, stone or materials necessary to carry on any public work, by paying any damages occasioned thereby. \n M.C. 1916, a. 557 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 836 .   Every municipal inspector entrusted with the superintendence or direction of labour on any road, bridge, watercourse, or other public work, may, either in person or by others acting under his direction, and without previous notice, enter, in the daytime, to the distance of 60\u00a0m from such public work, upon any uncultivated land, and may take therefrom any materials requisite for such work, except fruit trees, maples, and any other trees preserved for ornament. \n M.C. 1916, a. 558 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 . 837 .   The municipal inspector must, as soon as possible, declare on oath what he believes to be the value of the damage occasioned by the taking of such materials. Every person using the right of way provided for in article 775 must also declare on oath what he believes to be the value of the damage occasioned by the exercise of such right. If the amount of damage exceeds $20 it must be assessed by arbitrators, according to the rules laid down in articles 1097 and following, respecting expropriation for municipal purposes. \n M.C. 1916, a. 559; 1939, c. 98, s. 5 ;  1941, c. 70, s. 12 . 838 .   The damages are paid by such municipal inspector out of the moneys placed in his hands for defraying the cost of such works, to the person who has suffered the damages, all municipal taxes, fines or costs due by such person to the municipality or its officers being previously deducted therefrom.  In default of such moneys, the damages are payable by the municipality, saving its recourse against the persons bound to perform such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 560 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 839 .   The municipal inspector may, without being authorized by the council, perform or have performed the work required on any municipal road, bridge, watercourse or sidewalk within his jurisdiction, which has not been performed in the manner or at the time prescribed, by the persons bound to perform such work. He may also furnish, purchase or cause to be furnished the materials which should have been furnished or purchased for such public work, and which have not been so furnished or purchased in the manner or at the time prescribed. Nevertheless, the cost of the work performed and the materials furnished or purchased under this article, must not exceed $5 each year for each piece of land liable for such work, unless the inspector has previously served on the persons liable for such municipal work, a special notice, either verbal or written, enjoining them to perform such work or to furnish the materials required within four days, the whole without prejudice to penalties or damages to which such persons are liable by reason of their default to perform such work or to furnish such materials in the manner and within the time prescribed by the  proc\u00e8s-verbaux , by the by-laws or by law. In every case, the municipal inspector who has performed work, or had the same performed, or furnished or purchased materials, or had the same furnished, under this article, must, as soon as possible, inform the persons in default by a special notice containing a statement of the amount due for such work or materials. \n M.C. 1916, a. 561 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 840 .   The value of such work or materials, with 20\u00a0% in addition thereto, may be recovered by the municipal inspector in his official capacity, together with costs against any person bound to perform such work or furnish such materials, by means of an ordinary action.  The municipality is responsible therefor if the person in default is unable to pay them. \n M.C. 1916, a. 562 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 841 .   If the municipal inspector does not comply with article 839, when the labour or materials required on any municipal work have not been performed or furnished in the manner and at the time prescribed, he must report thereon to the council. \n M.C. 1916, a. 563 . 842 .   The council, on such report, authorizes the municipal inspector to have the work done or the required materials furnished or purchased at the cost of the municipality, by some person selected either by it or by the inspector. \n M.C. 1916, a. 564 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 843 .   The cost of such work or materials is paid, on the order of the municipal inspector, by the secretary-treasurer of the municipality, and is recovered by the municipality from the persons in default, with 20\u00a0% over and above the amount thereof, and costs, by an ordinary action. \n M.C. 1916, a. 565 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 844 .   The amount of any judgment rendered in favor of the municipal inspector or of the municipality, on any action brought to recover the value of the work performed or the materials furnished or purchased by either the municipal inspector or the municipality, and the 20\u00a0% in addition thereto, together with interest and costs, are assimilated to municipal taxes. \n M.C. 1916, a. 566 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 845 .   In case of urgency the municipal inspector must have every road or piece of road under the control of the municipality raised, rounded or covered with sand, gravel or other substance deemed suitable. The cost of such work is, in every case, paid by the municipality, but it must recover the same from the persons liable for work on such roads, if the maintenance thereof is not at the charge and expense of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 567 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 846 .   The municipal inspector must, whenever he deems it necessary, or whenever he is called upon so to do by the council or the mayor: ( 1 )  \u00a0 visit and inspect municipal ferries, roads, sidewalks, watercourses and bridges situated within his jurisdiction; ( 2 )  \u00a0 take note of the condition of such ferries, roads, sidewalks, watercourses and bridges, and the work in connection therewith; ( 3 )  \u00a0 take note of the persons who have neglected to fulfil their obligations, and prosecute them in the name of the municipality; ( 4 )  \u00a0 report in writing to the municipality, twice a year, between the first and the fifteenth days of the months of June and October, the substance of the notes he has taken and the information he has obtained upon every public work under his superintendence; and he must further state the arrears of labour not performed or of materials not furnished, the value in money of such labour or materials, and the fines and costs remaining unpaid, specifying the lots in connection with which the same are due, and the owners or occupants of such lots, if known. \n M.C. 1916, a. 568 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 847 .   The municipal inspector must, when the roads, bridges, watercourses or other works are at the charge and expense of the municipality, lay before the council, in the month of January in each year: ( a )  \u00a0 a detailed list, accompanied by vouchers, of all work which has been performed during the year, the cost thereof, the number of men and horses employed, their wages, and the materials purchased; ( b )  \u00a0 an estimate of the amounts which he will require to meet the expenses of the coming year, upon roads, bridges, watercourses or other works. \n M.C. 1916, a. 569 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 848 .   The municipal inspector must likewise lay before the council, in the month of January in each year, a detailed inventory in duplicate of all articles, tools, implements and machines in his charge and of which he is the depositary. \n M.C. 1916, a. 570 . 849 .   Whenever a municipal bridge is destroyed or the use thereof becomes dangerous, or whenever the use of a municipal road becomes difficult or dangerous, the municipal inspector of the local municipality in whose territory such bridge or road, in whole or in part, is situated, must, without delay, in case of urgency, reconstruct or repair the same, or make a temporary bridge or crossing, at the expense of the local municipality. Such work is done by day labour, and its cost is recoverable by the local municipality, by means of an ordinary action, from the persons liable therefor under the law, by-laws or  proc\u00e8s-verbaux , and the amount of the judgment, with interest and costs, is assimilated to municipal taxes. \n M.C. 1916, a. 571 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 373 . 850 .   When the municipal territory is divided into road divisions, the municipal inspector may, if the municipality has not appointed a road inspector for each division, appoint a competent foreman or superintendent of works for each division.  The salary of such foremen or superintendents of works is fixed and paid by the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 572 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 374 . 851 .   Every person in default under article 810 to perform, on any municipal road, bridge, watercourse or sidewalk, any work prescribed by any provision of law or of the  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  or by-laws governing such work, is liable for any damage resulting from the non-performance of such work, in favor of the parties interested, or of the municipality or of any municipal officer when damages have been exacted from them, and is further liable to a fine of not less than $1 nor more than $4 for each day that he refuses or neglects to perform such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 573 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . CHAPTER  VI FORMALITIES IN CONNECTION WITH BY-LAWS AND PROC\u00c8S-VERBAUX RESPECTING ROADS, BRIDGES AND WATERCOURSES 852 .   Whenever any municipality decides, by resolution, upon the opening, closing, construction, enlargement, alteration, divergence or maintenance of a road, bridge or watercourse, which is or should be under its control, or whenever a petition of one or more persons interested in any such work is presented to its council, praying that the work to be performed on such road, bridge or watercourse be settled and determined, the council must, without delay: ( 1 )  \u00a0 summon the ratepayers interested in the projected work to one of its sittings, by public notice, and if, after hearing them, it is of opinion that such work should be performed, a by-law is made and passed to settle, determine and apportion, if need be, the work on such road, bridge or watercourse; or ( 2 )  \u00a0 appoint a special superintendent, whose duty it shall be to visit the places mentioned in the by-law, resolution or petition, to report thereon to the council or to draw up a  proc\u00e8s-verbal , if necessary, within 30 days of his appointment, or within a time fixed by the council. If the work to be performed comes within the jurisdiction of more than one regional county municipality, the special superintendent is appointed by the council of the regional county municipality in whose territory the initiative is taken. \n M.C. 1916, a. 574 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 375 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 853 .   If the work is to be performed at the expense of a local municipality, the making of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  for the work at the charge and expenses of such municipality is not obligatory, but such work shall be regulated and determined by the municipality ordering the same. \n M.C. 1916, a. 575 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 854 .   The special superintendent, after having taken the oath of office, must call, hold and preside over a public meeting of the ratepayers interested in the proposed work, on the day and at the hour and place which he has fixed, and whereof he has given public notice. Every ratepayer interested and present at such meeting is entitled to be heard. The special superintendent may, at any time after the public meeting of the ratepayers interested in the proposed work, go to the domiciles of the said ratepayers and obtain from them all the information he may deem necessary, and especially the real value, the area and official number of the lot by reason whereof each ratepayer is liable for the proposed work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 576 . 855 .   If the special superintendent is of opinion that the work in question should not be performed, he sets forth in his report the reasons for such opinion.  If, on the contrary, he is of opinion that such work should be performed, he draws up a  proc\u00e8s-verbal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 577 . 856 .   The municipality, after the expiration of the time within which such report should be made, in the event of its not having been made, or after having received the report of the special superintendent whenever the latter is of opinion that the work should not be performed, may either give such officer fresh instructions and order him to draw up, within a fixed time, a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  in accordance with this Chapter, or appoint another special superintendent in his stead. \n M.C. 1916, a. 578 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 857 .   Every  proc\u00e8s-verbal  must indicate: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the situation and description or the specifications of the work to which it relates; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the work to be performed and the time within which it must be performed; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the taxable immovable property of the owners or occupants bound to perform work or to contribute to its performance; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the proportion of labour to be performed by each ratepayer if the nature of the work admits of it, whenever the work is to be done by the ratepayers themselves. In the case of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  for a watercourse, it must also indicate the area of each piece of land drained, in whole or in part, by such watercourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 579 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 858 .   In the case of a front road, if all the work upon such road is imposed upon the owners or occupants of the lots fronting on such road, it is not necessary to indicate such lots in the  proc\u00e8s-verbal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 580 . 859 .   In the case of a front road, if, owing to peculiar circumstances, the work to be done upon such road by any owner or occupant exceeds by more than one-half the average of the work to be done upon the same road by owners of lands of equal value, such owner or occupant may be, in and by the  proc\u00e8s-verbal , exempted from a part of the work upon or the cost of such road; and such part of the road described in the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  is considered as a by-road.  Such front road must not exceed in length twice the width of the lot whereof it is the front road.  The excess is considered and kept in repair as a by-road, and the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law must not, in any case, derogate from article 885. \n M.C. 1916, a. 581 . 860 .   It may be further ordered by any  proc\u00e8s-verbal : ( 1 )  \u00a0 that every bridge or other construction forming part of the work upon a road or watercourse be constructed of stone, brick or other material of certain dimensions and according to plans and specifications annexed to the  proc\u00e8s-verbal , and which may be amended by the proper council or board of delegates; ( 2 )  \u00a0 that fences or handrails be placed at the side of any road where it passes near or borders upon any precipice, ravine, or other dangerous place; ( 3 )  \u00a0 that any piece of road, through a swamp or marshy ground, be made in whole or in part with fascines or pieces of square timber, according to the mode of construction decided upon; ( 4 )  \u00a0 that any road be or be not raised in the middle; ( 5 )  \u00a0 that any specified kind of materials be or be not used in making or repairing such road, bridge or watercourse; ( 6 )  \u00a0 that, if a road runs through standing timber, the trees on each side of the road be felled by the owner or occupant of such land or by persons bound to perform the road work, for the space of 6\u00a0m from each fence, unless such trees are fruit trees, or maple trees forming part of a maple grove, or are preserved for ornament to a property; ( 7 )  \u00a0 that the work may be done from the date of the coming into force of such  proc\u00e8s-verbal , without it being necessary to draw up a deed of apportionment; ( 8 )  \u00a0 that the work of building or repairing be not performed by the ratepayers themselves, but be done by contract at their expense, and that for such purpose it be publicly awarded, or be done by day labour under the direction of the officer who has the superintendence of the work, and, in each case, in conformity with article 934 and following. \n M.C. 1916, a. 582 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 . 861 .   In the case of a bridge to be built, in whole or in part, with the moneys of Qu\u00e9bec, the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or the by-law need not contain a plan, or specifications, or a description of the work; but it shall be sufficient to state, in the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, that the bridge will be built according to the plans, specifications, regulations or direction of the Government or of the department granting the funds, or of the officers of such department. \n M.C. 1916, a. 583 . 862 .   Every  proc\u00e8s-verbal  may, in addition, determine the general mode of constructing or repairing the road, bridge or watercourse, and works connected therewith. \n M.C. 1916, a. 584 . 863 .   The special superintendent must deposit the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or the report drawn up by him, in the office of the municipality by which he was appointed, within the time fixed by article 852 or fixed by the council in the case of article 856. \n M.C. 1916, a. 585 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 864 .   If it appears to the secretary-treasurer at whose office such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or report has been deposited, that the work to be performed is work falling within the jurisdiction of another municipality, he must, without delay, transmit the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  and all the proceedings connected therewith, to the office of the municipality to which they belong, for examination and homologation by its council, or by the board of delegates, as the case may be. If the work in question comes under the jurisdiction of more than one regional county municipality, the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  and proceedings connected therewith must be transmitted to the office of the regional county municipality in whose territory the work was originally proposed, to be afterwards submitted to the board of delegates. \n M.C. 1916, a. 586 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 376 . 865 .   The council or board of delegates concerned, at any time after the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  has been deposited at the office of the municipality under article 863 or 864, may homologate such  proc\u00e8s-verbal , with or without amendments, or reject the same; provided that public notice has been given by the secretary-treasurer of such municipality or by the secretary of the board of delegates, to the parties interested, of the time and place at which the consideration of such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  is to commence. Every person interested is entitled to be heard by the council or by the board of delegates, at the time appointed for the consideration of such  proc\u00e8s-verbal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 587 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 866 .   The council or the board of delegates, in any decision on the merits of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal , may tax the costs of the proceedings, and cause them to be paid by the parties interested, by the municipality or by any other person, in its discretion. In the absence of a decision by the council or by the board of delegates, the costs incurred may be recovered from the municipality under whose direction the special superintendent acted, saving its recourse against the petitioners who applied for the  proc\u00e8s-verbal. Such costs may be recovered by an ordinary action. \n M.C. 1916, a. 588 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 867 .   The secretary-treasurer of the municipality, or the secretary of the board of delegates, is bound, without delay, to give public notice of the homologation of any  proc\u00e8s-verbal  made under this Chapter. \n M.C. 1916, a. 589 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 868 .   Every  proc\u00e8s-verbal  comes into force at the expiration of 15 days after the public notice given under article 867; but it shall cease to be in force if the work thereby ordered is not performed within five years from its coming into force. \n M.C. 1916, a. 590 . 869 .   If any work ordered to be performed by a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by a by-law in force is falling to pieces or becoming ruinous, or is likely to fall from decay, it may be repaired or rebuilt under such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law, by observing the formalities prescribed therein, or with the amendments made by the council, if such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law has been amended. The rebuilding or repairing of such work may, however, only be ordered by the council on the report of the municipal inspector establishing that it is necessary to perform such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 591 . 870 .   Every  proc\u00e8s-verbal  in force may, at any time, by amended or repealed by the municipality, by by-law, on petition of one or more interested parties, or on the order of the council, provided that public notice be in every case given by the secretary-treasurer of the municipality or by the secretary of the board of delegates, to the parties interested, of the place where and the time when the consideration of the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  shall be begun. \n M.C. 1916, a. 592 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 871 .   A copy of every  proc\u00e8s-verbal  homologated by the council of a regional county municipality or by a board of delegates, must be transmitted without delay to the office of the local municipality in whose territory the watercourse governed by such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  is situated either in whole or in part. \n M.C. 1916, a. 593 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 377 . CHAPTER  VII ACT OF APPORTIONMENT 872 .   If the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  does not dispense with the making of an act of apportionment, the work required by such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  need not be performed by the ratepayers until an act of apportionment has been drawn up and comes into force. \n M.C. 1916, a. 594 . 873 .   Within 30 days after the coming into force of any  proc\u00e8s-verbal , the special superintendent must draw up and file, at the office of the municipality in which the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  is deposited, an act of apportionment of the work to be done under such  proc\u00e8s-verbal , unless an express provision of the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  dispenses therewith. \n M.C. 1916, a. 595 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 874 .   Every act of apportionment must indicate: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the work and the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  to which it relates; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the work to be done; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the taxable immovable property by the owners or occupants of which such work must be performed; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the proportion of the work which must be done by each of them; ( 5 )  \u00a0 the amount of the contribution which must be made by them in money, labour or materials; ( 6 )  \u00a0 the place where and time when, and the officers to whom such contribution must be delivered. \n M.C. 1916, a. 596 . 875 .   If the special superintendent has not drawn up and filed the act of apportionment within the time prescribed by article 873, the council in whose office such act should have been filed may order such special superintendent or any other person to draw up or file the same within a fixed time. \n M.C. 1916, a. 597 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 876 .   Whenever the council so orders, a new act of apportionment may be made of the work ordered under an old  proc\u00e8s-verbal , if the repair or rebuilding ordered by such  proc\u00e8s-verbal  is in question. \n M.C. 1916, a. 598 . 877 .   The act of apportionment comes into force 15 days after it has been filed in the office of the municipality, provided that public notice of the filing thereof has been given within such time. \n M.C. 1916, a. 599 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 878 .   Every act of apportionment is annexed to the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  to which it relates. In the case mentioned in article 871, a copy thereof must be transmitted without delay to the office of the local municipality in whose territory the watercourse is situated either in whole or in part. \n M.C. 1916, a. 600 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 378 . 879 .   The municipality in whose office an act of apportionment is filed may amend such act, on the petition of any ratepayer or of the municipal inspector, after having given public notice to the parties interested, of the place, day and hour at which the consideration of the petition and the amendment of the act of apportionment are to be proceeded with, and after having heard any interested party who desires to be heard. Every amendment to such act of apportionment comes into force 15 days after the passing thereof. \n M.C. 1916, a. 601 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 880 .   No provision of any act of apportionment may be inconsistent with those of the  proc\u00e8s-verbal  to which it relates. \n M.C. 1916, a. 602 . 881 .   Unless by by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal  the council otherwise orders, the contribution of the persons liable for work on roads and bridges is based, as to the bridges, upon the value, and, as to the roads, upon the area of the immovable property subject thereto. \n M.C. 1916, a. 603 . CHAPTER  VIII PERSONS LIABLE FOR WORK ON ROADS, BRIDGES AND WATERCOURSES IN THE ABSENCE OF A PROC\u00c8S-VERBAL OR BY-LAW DIVISION  I GENERAL PROVISIONS 882 .   The provisions of this Chapter, excepting those contained in article 885, and in the third paragraph of article 891, are applicable only in the absence of a  proc\u00e8s-verbal  or by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 604 . 883 .   The burden of proving that any municipal road, bridge or watercourse is not subject to this Chapter, is always upon the party claiming the exemption. \n M.C. 1916, a. 605 . DIVISION  II FRONT ROADS 884 .   The front road of each lot is kept in repair by the owner or occupant of such lot. If a lot is owned or occupied in portions, by two or more persons, such owners or occupants are jointly and severally liable for the work to be done on the whole of the front road of such lot, even in the case when the part of the lot owned or occupied by them does not border upon the road, saving their recourse against each other in proportion to the value of the land occupied by each. \n M.C. 1916, a. 606 . 885 .   No one is bound to keep in repair on one and the same parcel of land, in a depth of 1,75\u00a0km, more than one front road governed by this Chapter. If there is more than one front road on any piece of land of such depth, to be kept in repair in accordance with this Chapter, the council must declare which of such roads is to be kept in repair by the owner or occupant of the lot; and the other front roads are deemed to be by-roads. In default of such declaration, the owner or occupant is liable for work only upon the road in closest proximity to his residence. \n M.C. 1916, a. 607 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 .

He, as well as persons under his control, may pass over private property in the discharge of his duties, without thereby incurring any liability, provided he does no unnecessary damage thereto. If, upon examining the place, the special superintendent is of opinion that any lot belonging to a person who was not notified, will be affected by the work, he may call another meeting by means of a notice given as above mentioned. \n 1920, c. 83, s. 1 . 902 .

If the ferry is under the joint control of two local municipalities, as mentioned in article 926, either municipality may make by-laws respecting such ferry, under article 927; but such by-laws have no force or effect until they are approved by a resolution of the other municipality, or, in default of such resolution, by the Lieutenant-Governor. \n M.C. 1916, a. 618 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 929 .

A contract which, as a result of an exception provided for in subparagraph 2 of the fourth paragraph, is not a supply contract for the purposes of the third paragraph, is not a contract for the supply of equipment or materials for the purposes of the first and second paragraphs. ( 2 )  \u00a0 The time for the receipt of tenders shall not be less than eight days. However, in the case of tenders in relation to a contract referred to in the third paragraph of subarticle 1, the time limit for the receipt of tenders shall not be less than 15 days. ( 2.1 )  \u00a0 A call for public tenders in relation to a contract referred to in the third paragraph of subarticle 1 may stipulate that only tenders submitted by contractors or suppliers, in addition to contractors or suppliers having an establishment in Qu\u00e9bec, who have an establishment in a province or territory covered by an intergovernmental trade liberalisation agreement applicable to the municipality will be considered. The call for tenders referred to in the first paragraph may also stipulate that the goods concerned must be produced in a territory comprising Qu\u00e9bec and any other province or territory referred to in that paragraph. ( 3 )  \u00a0 Tenders shall not be called for nor shall the contracts resulting therefrom be awarded except on one or the other of the following bases: ( a )  \u00a0 for a fixed price; ( b )  \u00a0 at unit prices.

( 8 )  \u00a0 If, however, to comply with the conditions for the making of a government grant, it is necessary that the contract be awarded to any person except the one who made the lowest tender within the prescribed time, the council may, without the authorization of the Minister, award the contract to the person whose tender is the lowest among the persons fulfilling those conditions, if that tender was made within the prescribed time. ( 9 )  \u00a0 The member of a council who knowingly, by his vote or otherwise, authorizes or effects: ( a )  \u00a0 the awarding or the making, without public tenders, of a contract which, according to subarticle 1, is subject to that formality; or ( b )  \u00a0 the awarding or the making of a contract in contravention to the requirements of subarticle 7, may be declared disqualified to hold any municipal office for two years and may be held personally liable to the municipality for any loss or damage it may have suffered. The liability mentioned in this subarticle is joint and several, and it also applies to every officer or employee of the municipality and to every other person who knowingly becomes party to the illegal act. Proceedings in declaration of disqualification shall be taken in conformity with articles 838 to 843 of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C-25); an ordinary action shall be taken to obtain compensation for loss or damage.

Where the council chooses to use such a system, the call for tenders or any document to which it refers shall mention all the requirements and all criteria that will be used for evaluating the bids, as well as the weighting and evaluation methods based on those criteria. In such a case, the council shall not award the contract to a person other than the person whose bid has received the highest score. For the purposes of subarticle 8 of the first paragraph of article 935, the bid having received the highest score shall be considered to be the lowest tender. \n 1997, c. 53, s. 20 . 936.0.2 .

In the case of irresistible force of such a nature as to imperil the life or health of the population or to seriously damage the municipal equipment, the head of the council may order any expenditure he considers necessary and award any contract necessary to remedy the situation.  In such a case, the head of the council must report his actions and the reasons therefor to the council at its next sitting.

A municipality may not divide into several contracts having similar subject-matter an insurance contract or a contract for the performance of work, the supply of equipment or materials or the providing of services other than professional services necessary for the purposes of a proceeding before a tribunal, or a body or person exercising judicial or adjudicative functions, unless the division is warranted on grounds of sound administration. \n 2001, c. 25, s. 57 . 938.1 .   The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al may, on the conditions he determines, authorize a municipality to award a contract without calling for tenders or otherwise than in accordance with the regulation under article 938.0.1 or authorize the municipality to award a contract after calling for tenders by written invitation rather than by publication in a newspaper or rather than as required in the regulation.  The Minister may, on his own initiative, exercise that power in respect of all municipalities or any category of municipalities for a contract or any class thereof. The first paragraph does not apply where calls for tenders are required to be public under an intergovernmental trade liberalisation agreement applicable to the municipality. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 88 ;  1997, c. 53, s. 21 ;  1998, c. 31, s. 55 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 58 . 938.2 .

( 1 )  \u00a0 Between 15 November and 31 December, the council of every local municipality shall prepare and adopt its budget for the next fiscal year and provide therein for revenues at least equal to the expenditures provided for therein.

The document contemplated in the preceding paragraph must be drawn up in the form prescribed by the Minister. ( 3 )  \u00a0 The budget of the municipality must be transmitted to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al within 30 days of its adoption by the council. The Minister may order that such filing shall be on the form provided by him for that purpose.

If it is unable to adopt the budget within the prescribed time, the council shall fix the date of the sitting at which the budget is to be adopted so that the obligation set out in the first paragraph of article 956 is respected.  As soon as possible after the passing of the resolution by which the council fixes that date, the secretary-treasurer shall transmit a certified copy thereof to the Minister. If, on 1 January, the budget is not adopted, one-twelfth of each appropriation provided for in the budget of the preceding fiscal year is deemed to be adopted.  The same rule applies at the beginning of each subsequent month if, at that time, the budget has not yet been adopted. \n 1977, c. 53, s. 39; 1979, c. 72, s. 282 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 68 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 60 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 43 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 955 .   At least four weeks before the budget is tabled before the council for adoption, the mayor, at a sitting of the council, shall make a report of the financial position of the municipality.

At that sitting, the deliberations of the council and the question period must deal exclusively with the budget or the three-year program of capital expenditures. \n 1980, c. 16, s. 65 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 92 . 957 .   The budget or the three-year program of capital expenditures adopted, or an explanatory document on the budget or the program, must be distributed free of charge to every civic address in the territory of the municipality.  In addition to or in lieu of this distribution, the council may order that the budget or the three-year program, or the explanatory document on the budget or the program, be published in a newspaper circulated in the territory of the municipality. For the purposes of the first paragraph, the explanatory document on the budget is the document provided for in paragraph 8 of section 263 of the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F-2.1 ). \n 1980, c. 16, s. 65 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 93 . 957.1 .

TITLE  XXIII REVENUES OF THE MUNICIPALITY, THEIR ADMINISTRATION AND AUDITING OF ACCOUNTS \n 1996, c. 2, s. 455 . CHAPTER  I REVENUES OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION \n 1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 958 .   The revenues of the municipality consist of the moneys derived from the taxes and licences which this Code authorizes it to levy, of those derived from property owned by it, and of such moneys as are paid to it under the law or under any by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal. \n M.C. 1916, a. 634 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 959 .   All sums of money not specially appropriated form part of the general fund of the municipality. Whenever any sum levied is more than the amount required by the municipality to meet the liabilities for which such sum was raised, the surplus falls into the general fund of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 635 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 960 .   All sums of money forming part of the general fund of the municipality may be employed for any purpose within its jurisdiction. \n M.C. 1916, a. 636 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 960.1 .   The council may pass any by-law relating to the administration of municipal finances and determine the person who is to make payments out of the funds of the municipality and the formalities to be followed. \n 1996, c. 27, s. 94 . 961 .   No by-law or resolution of the council authorizing the spending of money has effect unless it is accompanied with a certificate from the secretary-treasurer indicating that the municipality disposes of sufficient funds for the purposes for which the expenditure is proposed. This article does not apply to a by-law or resolution that affects to the proposed expenditure any amount of money from a source other than the general fund or that authorizes the conclusion of a transaction. If a convention made under a by-law or resolution to which this article applies has effect in respect of more than one fiscal year, a certificate must be issued in accordance with the first paragraph in respect of that portion of the expenditures that will be made during the first fiscal year and thereafter at the beginning of each fiscal year in which the convention has effect. \n 1979, c. 36, s. 48 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 70 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 59, s. 15 . 961.1 .   The council may make, amend or repeal by-laws, to delegate to any officer or employee of the municipality the power to authorize the spending of money and make contracts therefor in the name of the municipality. Every by-law under the first paragraph shall indicate ( 1 )  \u00a0 the area of competence to which the delegation applies; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the amount of the spending the officer or employee may authorize; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the other conditions to which the delegation is subject. The rules governing the awarding of contracts by the municipality apply, adapted as required, to a contract awarded under this article.  Where, however, the authorization of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al is required for awarding a contract to a person other than the person who made the lowest tender, only the council may apply for the authorization of the Minister. Every authorization of expenditures granted under a delegation requires, to be valid, a certificate issued by the secretary-treasurer indicating that there are sufficient funds available for that purpose.  No such authorization is granted if it entails a financial commitment by a municipality for a period extending beyond the current fiscal year. The officer or employee who grants an authorization of expenditures shall indicate it in a report that he shall submit to the council at the next regular sitting held after the expiry of a five-day period following the authorization. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 70 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 962 .   All fees, revenues, or taxes, of every nature whatsoever, accruing or belonging to the municipality, shall be paid to and received by the secretary-treasurer alone, or by the officials designated by him for that purpose; and no other official shall, under any pretext whatsoever, receive any such fees, revenues or taxes, unless specially authorized so to do. \n M.C. 1916, a. 637 ;  1990, c. 4, s. 256 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 962.1 .   Where a cheque or other order of payment is received by the municipality and payment thereof is refused by the drawee, an administrative charge, the amount of which shall be fixed by by-law by the council, may be claimed from the drawer of the cheque or order. \n 1985, c. 27, s. 62 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 95 . 963 .   Every municipality may deposit at interest in a chartered bank, or invest in the public funds of Canada, or of Qu\u00e9bec, or on first hypothec, any moneys belonging to it. However, when the moneys are intended to form a sinking fund for the repayment of the principal of a loan or for the redemption of bonds issued, the municipality shall use the same yearly, or, as the case may be, deposit the same yearly in the office of the Minister of Finance, in the city of Qu\u00e9bec, in conformity with sections 34 to 48 of the Act respecting municipal debts and loans ( chapter D-7 ). Any municipality which had any agreement with any chartered bank or other institution, for depositing a sinking fund, under any resolution or by-law or otherwise, for redeeming bonds issued by it under any such by-law previous to 28 December 1876, may, with the consent of such bank or institution, withdraw any money deposited in virtue of the same, together with the interest thereon accrued, provided the money be applied forthwith to redeem the issued bonds for which such sinking fund is payable. Any bank or other institution in which the sinking fund mentioned in the third paragraph has been deposited, may pay over all such money, as well as the interest accrued thereon, to such municipality, on receiving a duly certified copy of a resolution to that effect. \n M.C. 1916, a. 638; 1917-18, c. 28, s. 5 ;  1952-53, c. 46, s. 1 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 705 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 964 .   The local municipality may, by resolution, whenever it deems it advisable, authorize the secretary-treasurer or any other officer to add a sum not exceeding 10% to all taxes to be levied on the taxable property in the territory of the municipality, to cover losses, costs and bad debts. \n M.C. 1916, a. 639 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 397 . 965 .   The financial year of the municipality begins on 1 January and ends on 31 December of each year, and the annual municipal taxes, assessments, licence fees, and other dues, are due and payable, subject to Division IV of chapter XVIII of the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F-2.1 ) which deals with the payment and refund of taxes, on the dates fixed by the council. \n M.C. 1916, a. 641; 1927, c. 74, s. 12 ;  1989, c. 68, s. 14 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . CHAPTER  II AUDITING OF THE MUNICIPALITY ACCOUNTS KEPT BY THE SECRETARY-TREASURER \n 1996, c. 2, s. 455 . DIVISION  I EXTERNAL AUDITOR \n 2001, c. 25, s. 60 . 966 .   During the period extending from 1 December to 15 April, the council shall appoint an external auditor for the fiscal year beginning during that period.  If, on 15 April, the appointment has not been made, the external auditor appointed for the preceding fiscal year shall remain in office. If the external auditor appointed for a fiscal year is not the external auditor in office for the preceding fiscal year, the secretary-treasurer shall inform the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al of the name of the new external auditor as soon as possible after his appointment. \n M.C. 1916, a. 642; 1921, c. 109, s. 1 ;  1927, c. 74, s. 13; 1930, c. 108, s. 1 ;  1935, c. 108, s. 7; 1938, c. 103, s. 7 ;  1949, c. 59, s. 67; 1952-53, c. 29, s. 20 ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 17, s. 2 ;  1977, c. 5, s. 14 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 44 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 96 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 61 . 966.1 .   If the office of the external auditor becomes vacant before the expiry of his term, the council shall fill the vacancy at the next sitting. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 62 . 966.2 .   The external auditor shall audit, for the fiscal year for which he was appointed, the financial statements, the statement fixing the aggregate taxation rate and any other document determined by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al by regulation published in the  Gazette officielle du Qu\u00e9bec. The external auditor shall make a report of his audit to the council. He shall state in his report, in particular, whether ( 1 )  \u00a0 the financial statements faithfully represent the municipality\u2019s financial position on 31 December and the results of its operations for the fiscal year ending on that date; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the aggregate taxation rate has been fixed in accordance with the regulations made under section 262 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1). \n 1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 63 . 966.3 .   The external auditor shall transmit his report to the secretary-treasurer not later than 31 March following the expiry of the fiscal year for which he was appointed. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 64 . 966.4 .   In no case may the following persons act as external auditor of the municipality: ( 1 )  \u00a0 a member of the council of the municipality; ( 2 )  \u00a0 an officer or employee of the municipality; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the associate of a person mentioned in paragraph 1 or 2; ( 4 )  \u00a0 a person who, during the fiscal year for which the audit is carried out, has, directly or indirectly, personally or through his associate, any participation, interest or commission in or under a contract with the municipality or in relation to such a contract, or who derives any benefit from the contract, unless his connection with the contract arises from the practice of his profession. The external auditor may be an individual or a partnership. The external auditor may entrust the work to his or its employees, but in such a case the external auditor\u2019s responsibility shall be the same as if the work had been entirely performed by him personally. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 65 . DIVISION  II AUDITOR AD HOC \n 2001, c. 25, s. 66 . 966.5 .   At any time of the year, if it deems it expedient, the council must likewise, by one or more auditors ad hoc specially appointed for the purposes of this paragraph, have an audit made of the accounts of the municipality for all or any of the preceding five years, provided no similar audit has been made for the year or years in question. At any time of the year, if called upon in writing so to do by at least 10 ratepayers, the council must likewise have an audit made of the accounts of the municipality for all or any of the preceding five years, provided no such audit has already been made for all or any of the years in question. In the case of the preceding paragraph, the auditor ad hoc shall be appointed by the council, but, before appointing him, the choice which the council proposes to make must be accepted in writing by the majority of the ratepayers who have asked for the audit, and, if such ratepayers and the council fail to agree, the auditor ad hoc shall be appointed by a Court of Qu\u00e9bec judge for the judicial district, on the petition of one of the parties after a notice of eight clear days to the other party. The costs of such audit are payable by the secretary-treasurer if he is guilty of embezzlement or if, found to be short in his accounts, he fails to make reimbursement within the time fixed by article 969; if not, and if it be of no benefit to the municipality, they are chargeable to the persons who have applied for it. The request in writing made to the council by at least 10 ratepayers, in accordance with this article, must be accompanied by a deposit of $500.  Such deposit must be returned to the applicants if the costs of the audit are not charged to the persons who requested same. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  1988, c. 21, s. 66 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 67 . 966.6 .   The auditor ad hoc may be an individual or a partnership.  He may entrust his employees with his work but his responsibility is then the same as if he had performed all the work personally. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 71 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 68 . 967 .   In every case the auditor ad hoc must, at least five days before the date fixed for the audit, give special notice to the secretary-treasurer in conformity with this Code, or a written notice served upon him by a bailiff, who shall make a return of such service, calling upon such secretary-treasurer to attend and give all explanations and produce all documents that may be required of him. If it be a question of the auditing of the accounts of a secretary-treasurer no longer in office, the secretary-treasurer in office must furnish to the auditor ad hoc, on application therefor, all papers, copies, books and documents that may be required. \n M.C. 1916, a. 643; 1921, c. 109, s. 1 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 69 . 968 .   If the secretary-treasurer interested refuses or neglects to comply with the order served upon him, under article 967, the auditor ad hoc must, nevertheless, proceed to the auditing of such accounts, and forward his report to the council, together with a statement of the amount of his costs and disbursements.  The council, at a regular or special meeting, certifies the amount, if any, due the auditor ad hoc; and a copy of the resolution it has adopted respecting such report together with a copy of such report must be served as soon as possible upon the secretary-treasurer by a bailiff. The auditor ad hoc must, at the same time that he forwards his report to the council, transmit a certified copy thereof to the chairman of the council. \n M.C. 1916, a. 644; 1921, c. 109, s. 1 ;  1926, c. 69, s. 2; 1938, c. 103, s. 8 ;  1939, c. 98, s. 6 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 70 . 969 .   Within 15 days after the service of the copy of the report, the secretary-treasurer must pay the amount of such shortage, as well as the costs and disbursements of the auditor ad hoc. \n M.C. 1916, a. 645; 1921, c. 109, s. 1 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 71 . 970 .   If the secretary-treasurer refuses or neglects to comply with article 969, he may be sued by the municipality or by any interested ratepayer, and may be condemned to pay the amount which he has acknowledged, or which the court has decided, that he owes, together with all such other sums as the court orders him to pay, as well as the costs of the prosecution. This article applies likewise to the case where the secretary-treasurer declares or acknowledges the indebtedness in a deed by which the accounts are rendered, corrected or amended, and which is accepted by the council. \n M.C. 1916, a. 646 ( part ) ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 80, a. 1 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 971 .   All actions or claims against the secretary-treasurer resulting from his administration are prescribed by five years from the day on which the shortage in his accounts is reported by the auditor ad hoc to the council. \n M.C. 1916, a. 647 ;  2001, c. 25, s. 72 . 972 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 648 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 398 . TITLE  XXIV TAXES AND LICENCES CHAPTER  I GENERAL PROVISIONS 973 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 680; 1979, c. 72, s. 285 ;  1991, c. 32, s. 174 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 399 . 974 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 681; 1977, c. 53, s. 40 ;  1991, c. 32, s. 175 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 399 . 975 .   Every year, at the time fixed under the second, third or fourth paragraph of article 148, the council of the regional county municipality shall prepare and adopt the budget of the municipality for the next fiscal year, or for the current fiscal year if the council invokes an extension of time after 1 January. The budget shall consist of as many parts as there are categories of powers exercised by the regional county municipality.  A category is the whole of the powers in respect of which the representatives of the same local municipalities are qualified to take part in the deliberations and to vote. Each part of the budget shall be adopted separately.  The members of the council who are qualified to take part in the deliberations and to vote in respect of the powers forming the category to which a part relates may deliberate and vote in respect of that part. The secretary-treasurer must forward a copy of the budget to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al and to every local municipality not later than the fifteenth day following its adoption. The Minister may order that the budget be transmitted by means of a form furnished by him for that purpose. The copy must be accompanied with an estimate of the apportionment which is to be imposed on every local municipality under article 976. If, on 1 January, the budget or a part of the budget is not adopted, one twelfth of each appropriation provided for in the budget or in the corresponding part of the budget of the preceding fiscal year is deemed to be adopted.  The same rule applies at the beginning of each subsequent month if, at that time, the budget or part of the budget has not yet been adopted. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 28; 1977, c. 53, s. 41 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 54 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 72 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 63 ;  1987, c. 102, s. 45 ;  1993, c. 65, s. 99 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 400 ;  1997, c. 93, s. 92 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 976 .   Before 1 March every year, the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, with the approval of the council thereof, must apportion among all the local municipalities concerned the sums payable to the regional county municipality for the current fiscal year under either municipal orders or former apportionments in force.  He must, before the same date, transmit a certified true copy of the apportionment to the office of each local municipality. On sufficient proof that it is impossible to make the apportionment or to transmit copy thereof before 1 March, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al may allow the apportionment or transmission to be made before such later date as he may fix. Whenever a new sum of money is required by the regional county municipality after the period fixed by this article, a fresh apportionment must be made and transmitted in the same manner by the secretary-treasurer. This article applies subject to any by-law adopted under section 205.1 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1). \n M.C. 1916, a. 682; 1975, c. 82, s. 29 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 55 ;  1991, c. 32, s. 176 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 401 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 977 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 683 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 402 . 978 .   All municipal taxes imposed on taxable property must be fairly apportioned according to the assessment roll in force, on all property liable for the payment of such taxes, in proportion to their taxable value, saving the case mentioned in article 808, or any other special provision. \n M.C. 1916, a. 684; 1979, c. 72, s. 286 . 979 .   The council of any local municipality may impose the special tax for the payment of municipal works of any kind, including works of maintenance, according to either the municipal valuation or the area or the frontage of the taxable property subject to such tax.  In the case of lots that are situated at a street corner or are not rectangular, the council may fix the frontage for assessment purposes in the manner it deems appropriate. The council may also charge the cost of the works ( 1 )  \u00a0 to the municipality; ( 2 )  \u00a0 to the ratepayers of part of the territory of the municipality; ( 3 )  \u00a0 to ratepayers benefiting from the works when they are carried out in any part of the territory of the municipality designated as its \u201ccentral sector\u201d under a special planning program. The council may combine the alternatives provided for in the second paragraph in the proportions it determines. In the case contemplated in subparagraph 3 of the second paragraph, the council may identify the immovables of those who benefit from the works or provide one or more criteria allowing to identify them. This article applies for the purposes of the payment of professional fees related to the works contemplated, whether or not they were carried out. \n 1963 (1st sess.), c. 65, s. 8; 1968, c. 86, s. 38 ;  1979, c. 36, s. 49; 1982, c. 63, s. 56 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 64 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 403 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 980 .   Municipal apportionments, taxes or contributions in labour or materials imposed by a local municipality are always, after they fall due, convertible into money, by a resolution of the council, after special notice to the ratepayers interested, or by the judgment of a court. \n M.C. 1916, a. 685 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 404 . 980.1 .   Where the loan ordered by by-law is insufficient to cover the cost of carrying out the object of the by-law, the municipality shall allocate for that purpose the missing amount out of the general fund. Where the tax imposed to reimburse the loan is to be borne by part only of the owners of taxable immovables in the territory of the municipality, the council may, by by-law, impose a special tax on those immovables to pay into the general fund a sum equal to the sum withdrawn under the first paragraph.  The tax may be imposed in respect of a period not exceeding the term of repayment of the loan. Where the tax imposed to reimburse the loan is to be borne by both the municipality and by part only of the owners of taxable immovables in the territory of the municipality, the second paragraph applies, except that the council shall ( 1 )  \u00a0 take into account the cause of the insufficiency of funds in apportioning the tax imposed to reimburse the loan; ( 2 )  \u00a0 comply with the proportion fixed for the apportionment of the tax, subject to paragraph 1. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 73 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 405 . 980.2 .   If, in the case contemplated in article 980.1, no excess expenditure has yet been incurred, the municipality may also pass a loan by-law to raise the missing amount. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 73 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 981 .   Taxes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum from the expiration of the time prescribed therefor by article 1013 or, as the case may be, under Division IV Chapter XVIII of the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F-2.1 ) which deals with the payment and refund of taxes.  Neither the council nor any municipal officer can remit such interest. The council, as often as it considers it expedient, may, by resolution, prescribe a rate of interest different from the rate provided in the first paragraph.  The rate also applies to all unpaid debts before the passing of the resolution.  The resolution of the council shall remain in force until it is repealed. The tax account shall indicate clearly the rate of interest in force at the time of its sending. When the council has passed a resolution allowing a discount, under article 1007, the interest shall run only from the expiration of the term fixed for benefitting from such discount. \n M.C. 1916, a. 687; 1937, c. 59, s. 2 ;  1950, c. 74, s. 9; 1968, c. 85, s. 2 ;  1968, c. 86, s. 39; 1975, c. 82, s. 30 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 58 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 65 ;  1989, c. 68, s. 15 . 982 .   All municipal taxes imposed on any land may be collected from the occupant or other possessor of such land as well as from the owner thereof, or from any subsequent purchaser of such land, even when such occupant, possessor or purchaser is not entered on the valuation roll. \n M.C. 1916, a. 688 . 982.1 .   The claims of the municipality for taxes other than property taxes, of any nature whatsoever, are considered to be a prior claim on the immovables or movables by reason of which they are due, of the same nature and with the same rank as the claims described in paragraph 5 of article 2651 of the Civil Code; they are secured by a legal hypothec on the immovables or on the movables, as the case may be.  In addition to being a prior claim within the meaning of that paragraph, a property tax is secured by a legal hypothec on the immovable subject to the tax. For the purposes of the first paragraph, a personal tax imposed by reason of an activity carried on in a place is deemed to be a tax due by reason of the movable property of the debtor located in the place at any time throughout the period during which the tax remains due. \n 1994, c. 30, s. 95 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 982.2 .   Registration by the municipality of a legal movable or immovable hypothec does not prevent it from exercising its prior claim. \n 1994, c. 30, s. 95 . 982.3 .   A creditor who takes procedures in execution or who, as holder of a movable or immovable hypothec, has registered a prior notice of his intention to exercise his hypothecary rights, may apply to the municipality to declare the amount of its prior claim.  The application shall be registered and proof of notification shall be filed in the registry office. Within 30 days following the notification, the municipality shall declare the amount of its claim and enter it in the appropriate register; such a declaration does not have the effect of limiting the priority of the municipality\u2019s claim to the amount entered. An application for registration, in the land register, of the application for declaration and of the declaration shall be made in the form of a notice. In addition to the provisions of this section and the requirements of the regulation made under Book IX of the Civil Code, the notice shall indicate the legislative provision under which it is given, the name of the debtor and the name of the municipality; the notice need not be attested and a single copy only need be presented. \n 1994, c. 30, s. 95 . 983 .   Any person, not being the owner, who pays municipal taxes imposed by reason of the land which he occupies, is subrogated without other formality in the prior claims and in the hypothecary claims of the municipality on the immovables of the owner, and may, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, withhold from the rent or from any other debt which he owes him, or recover from him by personal action, the amount which he has paid in principal, interest and costs. \n M.C. 1916, a. 689 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 489 . 984 .   Saving article 983, any person, not being the debtor, who pays a municipal or school, property or personal, general or special tax, or the water rates for a third party, with the consent in writing of the latter, is of right subrogated in the prior claims and legal hypothecs of the municipality on the movable or immovable property of the debtor and may recover from him the amount of taxes so paid.  Such subrogation shall be of no effect unless the receipt given by the secretary-treasurer of the municipality who is bound to issue such receipt states that the payment was made by a third party for the debtor. The fact that the taxes were paid by a third party and that the latter is subrogated in the prior claims and legal hypothecs of the municipality must be noted in the books of the municipality and mentioned in every statement furnished by an officer of the council respecting the taxes owed by any person or affecting an immovable.  The omission of such mention shall render the municipality liable for the prejudice caused thereby to a third person, saving its recourse against the officer in default. The third party with subrogation cannot exercise his right under prior claims and legal hypothecs of the municipality more than three years after the date of payment unless, within such time, he has given written notice to the secretary-treasurer of the municipality, mentioning the balance due on his claim.  The secretary-treasurer must note such notice in the books of the municipality in the same manner as the payment with subrogation and the above-mentioned time of three years shall begin to run again as from the date of the receipt, by the secretary-treasurer, of such notice, which may be renewed. After three years from the date of payment, mention of taxes paid with subrogation shall no longer be required in the statements furnished by an officer of the council unless a notice has been received within the preceding three years in accordance with the foregoing provisions. \n 1929, c. 93, s. 1; 1943, c. 48, s. 5 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 490 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 985 .   Arrears of municipal taxes are prescribed by three years. An application to the court for the recovery of a property tax filed before the tax is prescribed and served, not later than 60 days after the expiry of the prescription period on any of the persons from whom the payment may be claimed under article 982, shall interrupt prescription with respect to all those persons. \n M.C. 1916, a. 690 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 97 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 986 .   The municipal council having jurisdiction to send municipal tax bills in the territory of the school board or a part thereof may, by agreement with the school board, order the secretary-treasurer to collect the school taxes levied on the immovables situated on their common territory. Levying of these taxes shall be carried out in accordance with sections 314 to 324 of the Education Act ( chapter I-13.3 ). \n M.C. 1916, a. 691; 1979, c. 72, s. 287 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 555 . 987 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 692 ;  1988, c. 19, s. 252 . CHAPTER  II IMPOSITION OF TAXES 988 .   All taxes are imposed by by-law or  proc\u00e8s-verbal , except in cases otherwise provided for. \n M.C. 1916, a. 695 . 989 .   Every local municipality may impose and levy annually, within the limits determined by this Code, by direct taxation on all the taxable property in the territory of the municipality, any sum of money required to defray the expenses of administration, or for any special purpose whatever, within its jurisdiction. The council of any local municipality may order, by by-law, that the annual property tax shall be imposed by resolution. From and after the coming into force of such by-law and until it has been repealed, such tax shall be imposed by resolution. \n M.C. 1916, a. 696; 1945, c. 70, s. 8 ;  1950, c. 74, s. 10; 1979, c. 72, s. 289 ;  1988, c. 76, s. 4 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 406 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 990 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 In addition to any property tax that it may impose and levy on serviced vacant land, the council of any local municipality may impose and levy annually on such land a surtax equal to 50\u00a0% of the total municipal property taxes imposed in the same year on such land, to which all taxable immovables in the territory of the municipality are subject. Within the meaning of this article, \u201cserviced vacant land\u201d means land ( a )  \u00a0 on which there is no building or on which there is a building of a real value of less than 10\u00a0% of the value of the land according to the valuation roll; and ( b )  \u00a0 which is adjacent to a public street bordering which water and sanitary sewer services are available. Such tax ranks in every respect as a general property tax of the municipality, subject to this article.  It applies from the first fiscal year of the municipality in respect of which, according to the valuation roll in force, the land is entered as part of the aforementioned category on the day of the coming into force of the roll. ( 2 )  \u00a0 The following land is not subject to the surtax provided for in subarticle 1: ( a )  \u00a0 an agricultural operation registered in accordance with a regulation adopted pursuant to section 36.15 of the Act respecting the Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture, des P\u00eacheries et de l\u2019Alimentation ( chapter M\u201014 ); ( b )  \u00a0 land utilized continuously for housing or used continuously for industrial or commercial purposes other than the commercial parking business; ( c )  \u00a0 land owned by a railway undertaking and on which there is a railway track, including a railway track situated in a yard or building; ( d )  \u00a0 land used for overhead electric powerlines; ( e )  \u00a0 land on which construction is prohibited by law or by by\u2010law. ( 3 )  \u00a0 In the case of a municipality whose territory is included in that of the Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al, the council may impose and levy a surtax on vacant land, whether serviced or not, that is governed by this article, subject to the reservation contained in the second paragraph. The amount of the surtax is determined by the council and may amount to up to 100\u00a0% of the total property taxes referred to in subarticle 1.  The council may fix different amounts for serviced vacant land and for unserviced vacant land, in which case the amount fixed for the former must be higher than that fixed for the latter. The surtax contemplated in this subarticle replaces the surtax contemplated in subarticle 1. ( 4 )  \u00a0 Vacant land, whether or not it is serviced, shall not be subject to the surtax provided for in this article unless the unit of assessment to which it belongs according to the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F\u20102.1 ) includes no immovable other than the land and, where applicable, the building referred to in subparagraph  a  of the second paragraph of subarticle 1. ( 5 )  \u00a0 No municipality shall, for any one fiscal year, impose the surtax provided for in this article and fix, under section 244.29 of the Act respecting municipal taxation, a general property tax rate that is specific to the category of serviced vacant lands provided for in section 244.36 of that Act. \n 1977, c. 53, s. 42; 1979, c. 72, s. 490 ;  1980, c. 34, s. 2 ;  1986, c. 32, s. 15 ;  1991, c. 29, s. 6 ;  1993, c. 43, s. 16 ;  1993, c. 78, s. 17 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 407 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  2000, c. 54, s. 12 . 991 .   Every local municipality may impose and levy annually, within the limits determined by this Code, by means of direct taxation on all the taxable property, or only on the taxable property belonging to those persons who, in the opinion of its council, are specially interested in any public work under the control of the municipality, or belonging to those who specially benefit by such work, all sums of money required for the construction and maintenance of such work. The council of any local municipality may, by by-law, enact that in the future taxes provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be imposed every year by resolution; as from the coming into force of this by-law and until its repeal, these taxes shall be imposed every year by resolution. \n M.C. 1916, a. 697; 1946, c. 55, s. 14 ;  1950, c. 74, s. 11; 1979, c. 72, s. 291 ;  1988, c. 76, s. 5 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 408 . 992 .

Every local municipality may make, amend and repeal bylaws to require every owner of a bicycle or non-motorized bicycle to obtain from the municipality an annual licence, to fix the cost of such licence; to require that the licence be attached permanently to the vehicle, and to enable the municipality to enter into agreement with a third person under which the third person issues the licence and collects its costs on behalf of the municipality.  The third person and his employees are then deemed to be officers or employees of the municipality. \n 1949, c. 71, s. 11; 1983, c. 57, s. 28 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1996, c. 77, s. 32 . 995 .   Whenever a municipal by-law exacting a licence or permit provides for a fine or penalty for infringement, the municipality may, at its option, take penal action or civil suit for the cost of the permit or of the licence, even if the name of the person subject to the permit or to the licence be not entered on the valuation roll or on the collection roll. \n 1940, c. 72, s. 2 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 996 .   The proceeds of the tax, licence or permit, as the case may be, form part of the general fund of the local municipality, which may dispose of the same according to law. The local municipality may, however, appropriate the proceeds of licences or permits issued in favour of ratepayers residing in a specified section of the territory of the municipality, for the payment either of sidewalks or of a water-works or lighting system established for such section of the territory. \n M.C. 1916, a. 704; 1927, c. 76, s. 1 ;  1979, c. 72, s. 294 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 410 . 997 .

CHAPTER  III COLLECTION ROLL AND COLLECTION OF TAXES DIVISION  I COLLECTION ROLL 1001 .   The secretary-treasurer of every local municipality must make a general collection roll, each year, in the month of October or at any time fixed by the council, which shall include all taxes, both general and special, then imposed, making separate mention thereof. He must also make a special collection roll, whenever any special tax has been imposed after the making of the general collection roll, or whenever he is ordered so to do by the council.  Such special roll shall exist as a separate roll only until the date fixed by the council for the preparation of new general roll, and it must then be included in the new general roll which the secretary-treasurer must prepare. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of article 957.3, the special collection roll made following the imposition of a special tax as a consequence of the adoption of a supplementary budget shall be separate from the general collection roll even after the date fixed by the council for preparing the general roll. \n M.C. 1916, a. 710 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 74 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1002 .

The collection roll shall not be completed before 1 January nor until the budget of the municipality is adopted and forwarded to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. The secretary-treasurer, upon completion of the collection roll, gives public notice by which he announces that the general collection roll or the special roll, as the case may be, is deposited at his office and that the tax accounts shall be sent within the allotted time. Notwithstanding any inconsistent legislative provision, any local municipality may, by resolution, allow a discount to every person paying the amount of his taxes within the time fixed by such resolution; such time shall not be of more than 50 days after the posting up of the public notice provided for in the preceding paragraph. \n M.C. 1916, a. 716; 1937, c. 101, s. 1 ;  1949, c. 71, s. 12; 1975, c. 82, s. 31 ;  1977, c. 53, s. 45 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 66 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 98 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1008 .

The council may avail itself of the first two paragraphs differently according to the sectors of the territory of the municipality it determines. The council of a municipality whose territory includes several \u201ccentral sectors\u201d under a special planning program may also avail itself of the first two paragraphs differently in respect of each of them, for the purposes of article 1011. \n 1984, c. 27, s. 105 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 67 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 417 ;  1996, c. 77, s. 35 ;  1999, c. 59, s. 17 . 1011.3 .

Such seizure and sale are made under a warrant prepared by the mayor or the warden, as the case may be, and signed and issued by the clerk of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec or the clerk of the Superior Court, according to the amount claimed. Such warrant is addressed to a bailiff, and must be executed by that officer under his oath of office, according to the same rules and under the same responsibilities and penalties as a writ of seizure of movable property in execution issued by the Court of Qu\u00e9bec. The mayor or warden, as the case may be, in preparing such warrant, does not incur any personal responsibility; he acts under the responsibility of the municipality on whose behalf the collection is made. The clerk shall issue the warrant upon the filing of a certificate of the mayor or the warden, as the case may be, establishing that the debt is exigible in the amount indicated therein. \n M.C. 1916, a. 719; 1949, c. 59, s. 69 ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 17, s. 2 ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 80, a. 1 ;  1986, c. 95, s. 89 ;  1988, c. 21, s. 66 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1015 .

Such notice must also state the name and style of the person whose effects are to be sold. \n M.C. 1916, a. 720 . 1016 .   If the debtor is absent, or if there is no person to open the doors of the house, the cupboards, chests, or other closed places, or in the event of refusal to open the same, the seizing officer may, by order of the clerk of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec, of the clerk of the Superior Court or of any justice of the peace, have the same opened, in the presence of two witnesses, with all necessary force. \n M.C. 1916, a. 721 ( part ) ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 80, a. 1 ;  1986, c. 95, s. 90 ;  1988, c. 21, s. 66 . 1017 .   The seizure and sale can be suspended only upon an opposition issued from the Court of Qu\u00e9bec or from the Superior Court, according to the amount of the seizure.  Such opposition must be accompanied by an order of suspension signed by the judge or the clerk. It is returnable within eight days, and is tried and decided according to the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25 ). In addition to the grounds mentioned in article 596 of the Code of Civil Procedure, opposition to annul the seizure may be taken to the competent court for any cause likely to affect the claim of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 722; 1949, c. 59, s. 69 ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 17, s. 2 ;  1986, c. 95, s. 91 ;  1988, c. 21, s. 66 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1018 .   The proceeds of the sale of the effects seized, the costs of seizure and sale being deducted therefrom, are applied by the secretary-treasurer to the payment of the amounts which appear on the collection roll, with interest and costs. The surplus, if any, is paid by the secretary-treasurer to the person whose effects were so sold, or is retained by him, when a claim is made against it, until a decision has been rendered by the court, upon petition to that effect.  If the claim is admitted by the defendant, the moneys are paid by the secretary-treasurer to the claimant. \n M.C. 1916, a. 723 . DIVISION  III SUITS FOR THE RECOVERY OF TAXES AND FILING OF THE CLAIM OF THE MUNICIPALITY IN THE SHERIFF\u2019S OR THE CLERK OF THE COURT\u2019S OFFICE, WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A JUDICIAL SALE \n 1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1019 .   The payment of municipal taxes may also be claimed in the name of the municipality by an action instituted in the Court of Qu\u00e9bec or the municipal court, if there be one. The clerk of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec has the same power as the clerk of the Superior Court under article 194 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25 ), upon the accomplishing of the same formalities, to render judgment against the defendant who fails to appear or to plead, provided that a detailed statement of the municipal taxes by filed.  In either case, the declaration, under oath or affidavit, establishing that the amount is due to the knowledge of the deponent, is given and subscribed to by the secretary-treasurer, who takes the oath before the mayor of the municipality which is the plaintiff, or before a justice of the peace, a commissioner for oaths or a notary. The defendant may obtain a stay of such action if the rolls, by-laws,  proc\u00e8s-verbaux  or other municipal acts upon which it is based are sought to be quashed or annulled, unless section 252.1 of the Act respecting municipal taxation ( chapter F-2.1 ) provides that the tax must be paid despite the proceedings to quash or annul.

TITLE  XXV SALE OF IMMOVABLES FOR NON-PAYMENT OF TAXES CHAPTER  I SALE AND ADJUDICATION OF IMMOVABLES 1022 .   The secretary-treasurer of every local municipality must prepare, in the course of the month of November in each year, a statement showing, in as many separate columns: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the name and style of every person indebted to the municipality for municipal taxes, as set forth in the valuation roll, if entered therein; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the amount of municipal taxes remaining due to the municipality by each of such persons or by persons unknown; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the amount of municipal taxes due by each of such persons to the officers of the municipality; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the amount of school taxes due by each of such persons, up to the date of the drawing up of such statement, if a statement of such arrears has been lodged in time in the office of the municipality, by the director general of the school board concerned; ( 5 )  \u00a0 the costs of collection due by each of such persons; ( 6 )  \u00a0 the description of all immovable property liable for the payment of the taxes mentioned in such statement; ( 7 )  \u00a0 the total amount of taxes and costs affecting such immovable property for municipal or school taxes; ( 8 )  \u00a0 all other information required by the council, and all other opportune remarks. Such statement must be submitted to the council and approved by it. When the date for the sale of immovables has been changed in virtue of the last paragraph of article 1026, such statement must be prepared during the fourth month preceding the month fixed for such sale. \n M.C. 1916, a. 726; 1947, c. 77, s. 23 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 556 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1023 .   The secretary-treasurer of every local municipality must, if ordered by the council, before 20 December in each year, transmit to the office of the regional county municipality an extract from such statement as approved by the council, containing: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the name and style of every person indebted for municipal or school taxes imposed on the immovable property owned or occupied by such persons; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the description of all immovable property liable for the payment of municipal or school taxes; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the sum total of the taxes affecting such immovable property for municipal or school purposes. The secretary-treasurer must transmit, at the same time, an extract of such statement to the office of each school board having jurisdiction in the territory where such immovables are situated. When the date for the sale of immovables has been changed in virtue of the last paragraph of article 1026, such extract must be transmitted before the twentieth day of the third month preceding the month fixed for such sale. \n M.C. 1916, a. 727; 1933, c. 121, s. 1 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 24 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 557 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 418 . 1024 .   When he has received from the director general of a school board a statement of the immovables to be sold by the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality for school taxes and monthly fees due, the secretary-treasurer of the local municipality must, if he has not already done so under article 1023, transmit to the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, before 31 December, a statement showing the amount of taxes due and affecting each such immovable property for municipal purposes; the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality must take such claim into account in preparing his list, and such amount shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale made by the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality. When the date for the sale of immovables has been changed in virtue of the last paragraph of article 1026, such statement must be transmitted before the last day of the third month preceding the month fixed for such sale. \n 1933, c. 121, s. 2; 1947, c. 77, s. 25 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 558 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 419 . 1025 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 728; 1947, c. 77, s. 26 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 420 . 1026 .   The secretary-treasurer of every regional county municipality must, each year, before the eighth day of the second month preceding the month fixed for the sale of immovables for non-payment of taxes, from the statements transmitted under article 1023, prepare a list showing: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the description of every immovable situated in the territory of the regional county municipality, on account of which municipal or school taxes are due, together with the names of the owners as mentioned in the valuation roll; ( 2 )  \u00a0 opposite the description of every such immovable, the amount of the taxes for which it is liable. Such list is accompanied by a public notice setting forth that such immovables are to be sold at public auction, at the place where the sittings of the council of the regional county municipality are held, on the second Thursday of the month of March following, at 10\u00a0a.m., in default of payment of the taxes for which they are liable, and the costs incurred. If the second Thursday of the month of March is a non-juridical day, the sale must be fixed for the next following juridical day. In the case of Municipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de comt\u00e9 des \u00celes-de-la-Madeleine, the public notice must set forth that such immovables are to be sold at public auction on the first juridical Wednesday of the month of July following. However, the council of the regional county municipality may, by by-law, fix any other date for the sale of the immovables.  If that date falls on a non-juridical day, the sale is deferred to the next following working day. \n M.C. 1916, a. 729; 1922 (1st sess.), c. 80, s. 11 ;  1939, c. 98, s. 7; 1940, c. 72, s. 3 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 27 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 45 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 421 . 1027 .   The list and the notice accompanying it must be published in the ordinary manner in the local municipal territories in which the immovables advertised for sale are situated, and also twice in a newspaper circulated in those territories during the second month preceding the month fixed for the sale. Such publications, in the case of immovables situated in the territory of Municipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de comt\u00e9 des \u00celes-de-la-Madeleine, must be made during the month of May. At the time of the first publication of the list and notice, the secretary-treasurer must send a copy of the same by registered or certified letter to the registrar of the registration division in which the immovable advertised for sale is situated, and it shall be the duty of the registrar to notify interested parties in the manner indicated by the Civil Code. Failure to notify the registrar shall not render the proceedings null, but the officer so in default shall be responsible for any damage resulting therefrom. When the sale of an immovable mentioned in the list and notice above mentioned is not proceeded with, the secretary-treasurer in charge of such sale must inform the registrar thereof by registered or certified letter. The list may contain an abridged enumeration of the consecutive cadastral numbers of immovables belonging to the same owner. \n M.C. 1916, a. 730; 1938, c. 103, s. 12 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 28; 1950, c. 74, s. 12 ;  1975, c. 83, s. 84; 1977, c. 5, s. 14 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 61 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 46 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 422 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 99 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1028 .   The secretary-treasurer must also, by registered or certified letter, within the time provided in article 1026, notify, of the date and place of such sale, each person whose property is to be sold and whose name appears on the valuation roll then in force with respect to such immovable. If such person has no known domicile in Qu\u00e9bec, the formality of the notice shall not be necessary. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 34; 1975, c. 83, s. 84 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1029 .   For the purposes of this Title, subject to the sixth paragraph of article 1027, the description of an immovable contemplated in the second paragraph of paragraph 24 of article 25 is made up of the description of the land on which it is situated and a summary description of the immovable concerned, accompanied, if possible, with the name and address of its owner and any other indication that may help to identify it. \n 1979, c. 72, s. 299 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 100 . 1030 .   At the time appointed for the sale, the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, or some other person acting for him, sells, in the manner prescribed by article 1032, those immovables described in the list upon which taxes are still due, after making known the amount to be raised on each of such immovables, including therein a share of the costs of the sale, according and in proportion to the amount of the debt and of the disbursements that have been made to effect the sale of each of said immovables. In all proceedings had and adopted to effect such sale, the regional county municipality shall not be responsible for errors and informalities committed by local municipalities, against which alone third parties shall have recourse. \n M.C. 1916, a. 731 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 423 . 1031 .   The sale can be suspended only by an opposition instituted in the Court of Qu\u00e9bec, or in the Superior Court of the district according to their respective jurisdiction, determined by the value of the immovable as entered on the valuation roll in force. Articles 678 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25 ) shall apply to such opposition, with the necessary modifications. In addition to the grounds mentioned in article 596 of the Code of Civil Procedure, opposition to annul the seizure may be taken to the competent court for any cause likely to affect the claim of the municipality. \n 1935, c. 108, s. 9; 1938, c. 103, s. 17 ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 17, s. 2 ;  1965 (1st sess.), c. 80, a. 1 ;  1986, c. 95, s. 92 ;  1988, c. 21, s. 66 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1032 .   An immovable is adjudged to the highest bidder at a public auction. The proceeds of the sale are remitted by the secretary-treasurer to the clerk of the Superior Court of the district, to be distributed according to law. The clerk shall obtain from the registrar a copy of any page of the land register concerning the adjudged immovable that may be useful to him for the purposes of apportioning the proceeds of the sale. Where the clerk considers it necessary and if the amount to be apportioned exceeds $1,000, he may obtain from the registrar the certified statement described in articles 703 to 707 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C\u201025 ). The clerk shall pay out of the proceeds of the sale the cost of the copy of the page of the land register and, as the case may be, the cost of the certified statement. The proceeds of the sale shall be apportioned among the creditors according to the rules provided for in the case a seizure of immovables in execution, without the formality of a scheme of collocation if the amount to be apportioned does not exceed $1,000. After the money is distributed, the clerk is bound to file in the registry office a certified true copy of the judgment of distribution for full or partial cancellation of the registration of debts or hypothecs which have been paid, in whole or in part. \n M.C. 1916, a. 732; 1979, c. 72, s. 300 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 62; 1983, c. 57, s. 30 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 491 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  2000, c. 42, s. 137 . 1033 .   The secretary-treasurer is entitled to $0.10 for each hundred words or figures, for every notice, list or other document in relation to the sale of immovables liable for taxes, and to $1.50 for each certificate of adjudication, or for each deed of sale, in addition to the costs of the registration thereof, until such time as such fees are otherwise established by resolution. \n M.C. 1916, a. 733; 1968, c. 23, s. 8 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 47 . 1034 .   The purchaser of an immovable must pay the amount of his purchase money immediately upon the adjudication. In default of immediate payment, the secretary-treasurer either at once puts up the immovable again for sale, or adjourns the sale to the following days, or to any other day within eight days, by giving all persons present notice of such adjournment in an audible and intelligible voice. \n M.C. 1916, a. 734; 1982, c. 63, s. 63 . 1035 .   If at the time of the sale no offer is made, or if all the immovables advertised cannot be sold on the day fixed, the sale must be adjourned to the following day, or to any other day within eight days, in the manner set forth in the second paragraph of article 1034. If no offer is made for an immovable at the adjourned sale, the costs incurred shall be exigible from the local municipality which caused it to be put up for sale. \n M.C. 1916, a. 735; 1928, c. 94, s. 18 ;  1941, c. 69, s. 20; 1943, c. 48, s. 7 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1036 .   On payment by the purchaser of the amount of the purchase money, the secretary-treasurer sets forth the particulars of the sale in a certificate made in duplicate and signed by himself; he must deliver one of such duplicates to the purchaser. The purchaser is thereupon seized of the immovable adjudged, and may enter into possession thereof, subject to the same being redeemed within the two years next following, and to the payment of the constituted ground rents. The purchaser cannot, however, remove timber from such immovable during the first two years he is in possession thereof. \n M.C. 1916, a. 736 . 1037 .   The purchaser who cannot obtain delivery of the immovable adjudged may apply to any judge of the Superior Court of the district in which the said immovable is situated, by petition duly served, with a notice of at least three full days of the date of its presentation, upon any person refusing to surrender the said immovable, and obtain an order addressed to the sheriff or a bailiff commanding him to dispossess such person and put the purchaser in possession, without prejudice to the recourse of the latter against the said person for all damages and costs incurred. \n 1938, c. 103, s. 13 . 1038 .   When immovables situated in the territory of a local municipality are put up for sale for municipal or school taxes, the municipality may bid for and purchase such immovables through the mayor or another person, on the authorization of the council, without being held to pay forthwith the amount of the purchase money.  The municipality may also bid for and purchase such immovables at any sheriff\u2019s sale or at any sale having the effect of a sheriff\u2019s sale. The bid of the municipality must not exceed the amount of the taxes, in principal, interest and costs, plus a sufficient sum to satisfy every prior or hypothecary claim of a prior or equal rank to that of municipal taxes. \n M.C. 1916, a. 737; 1935, c. 108, s. 10 ;  1982, c. 63, s. 64 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 492 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 424 . 1039 .   The municipality shall enter the immovables so purchased, in its own name, on the valuation, collection and special assessment rolls, and shall assess them as any other immovable liable for taxes; and such immovables shall remain liable for the municipal and school taxes as any other immovable, and shall be taxed in the same way.  However, the school taxes so imposed shall not be exigible from the municipality. If the right of redemption is exercised, the redemption price must include, in addition to the sum paid by the municipality for such immovable and 10% interest on such sum, the amount of the general and special municipal and school taxes imposed on such immovable from the day of the adjudication to the day of the redemption, or the instalments due on such taxes if they are payable by instalments. \n 1935, c. 108, s. 10 . 1040 .   (Repealed). \n 1982, c. 63, s. 65 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 75 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 48 . 1041 .   A list of immovables sold under this Title, setting forth in each case the name and residence of the purchaser and the price of the sale, must be transmitted by the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, to the office of every local municipality in whose territory such immovables are situated, within 15 days after the adjudication; and the secretary-treasurer of every local municipality must, without delay, give a special notice to the owner or occupant of every such immovable, of the sale thereof, and of the particulars concerning it set forth in the list transmitted by the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 738 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 425 . 1042 .   The secretary-treasurer of every regional county municipality must, within 10 days after the adjudication thereof, transmit to the registrar a list of immovables sold for taxes under this Code. For the performance of such duty, he is entitled to $0.20 for each immovable mentioned in the list furnished by him, of which one-half is transmitted by him to the registrar with the list, to cover the fees of the latter for the deposit and entry, and for the cancellation thereof. The failure to forward such list, or to mention any lot therein, does not invalidate any proceedings in the matter in which such failure may occur, but the secretary-treasurer in default is responsible for any damage which may result therefrom. \n M.C. 1916, a. 739; 1982, c. 63, s. 66 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 493 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 426 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1043 .   If, within two years from the day of the adjudication, the immovable sold has not been bought back or redeemed according to Chapter II of this Title (articles 1057 to 1060), the purchaser becomes the absolute owner thereof. \n M.C. 1916, a. 740 . 1044 .   Such purchaser, upon exhibiting the certificate of his purchase, and proving the payment of all municipal taxes which in the meantime have become due thereon, is entitled, at the expiration of two years\u2019 time, to a deed of sale from the regional county municipality in whose territory such immovable is then situated. He is also entitled to such deed of sale at any time before the expiration of such delay, with the consent of the owner of the said immovable or that of his legal representatives and of the prior or hypothecary creditors, which persons must intervene in the said deed to attest their consent. \n M.C. 1916, a. 741; 1938, c. 103, s. 14 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 494 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 427 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1045 .   The deed of sale is executed in the name of the regional county municipality, by the secretary-treasurer, in the presence of two witnesses who sign it, or  en minute  before a notary. \n M.C. 1916, a. 742 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 428 . 1046 .   It is the duty of the warden and of the secretary-treasurer to see that the deed of sale is registered with due diligence. \n M.C. 1916, a. 743 . 1047 .   The costs of the deed of sale and of the registration thereof are payable by the purchaser, and are exigible before the deed is signed. \n M.C. 1916, a. 744 . 1048 .   The sale effected under this Chapter is a title which conveys the ownership of the immovable sold.  It vests in the purchaser all the rights of the original owner, and purges the immovable from all hypothecs whatsoever to which it may be subject, except, under reserve of the last paragraph, claims for constituted ground rents, for seigniorial dues and for rents substituted therefor, and the amounts for which such immovable may be encumbered for the payment of municipal bonds issued in aid of the construction of railways and other public undertakings; and except also the rights of trustees, for the amount of any assessment imposed on such immovable for defraying the cost of building or repairing any church, sacristy, parsonage or cemetery, provided that at least eight days before such sale, the chairman of the trustees has lodged with the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, whose duty it is to make such sale, a statement attested under oath before a justice of the peace, and establishing the amount of such assessment for which the immovable is liable. In all cases, however, where the immovable in question has been adjudged and sold before the issue of the letters patent from the State, such sale merely vests in the purchaser the right of preemption, or other rights already acquired in relation to such immovable. The adjudication of an immovable to any municipality, having an interest by reason of a prior claim or legal hypothec on the said immovable, purges the latter from all constituted ground rents, rents under emphyteusis and rents replacing seigniorial rights, counting from the date of the adjudication and as long as the immovable remains the property of the said municipality.  Such rents shall again be an encumbrance upon the immovable, but for the future only, from the date on which the immovable ceases to be the property of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 745; 1938, c. 103, s. 15 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 495 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 429 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1049 .   If the immovable sold does not exist, the purchaser is merely entitled to recover the sum paid by him, with interest at the rate of 15% per annum provided that not more than three years\u2019 interest be paid. If the adjudication or sale is declared null on any action brought to set aside the same, or in any other cause or contestation, the purchaser can exact only repayment of the purchase money paid by him, together with the cost of necessary repairs and of improvements which have increased the value of the immovable, up to such value, unless he prefers to remove the same, with interest upon the whole amount at the rate of 10% per annum. \n M.C. 1916, a. 746; 1929, c. 88, s. 23 . 1050 .   The action to annul the sale of an immovable effected under this Chapter, or the right to contest the legality thereof, is prescribed by two years from the date of such sale. \n M.C. 1916, a. 747 . 1051 .   If any immovable described in the list published under article 1027 is advertised for sale by the sheriff, the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality cannot sell such immovable, but must without delay transmit to the sheriff a statement of the sums due for taxes and costs of advertising on account of such immovable, which sums are paid out of the proceeds of the sale made by the sheriff. Such costs incurred by the secretary-treasurer are legal costs, and rank after the costs of the seizor. \n M.C. 1916, a. 748 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 496 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 430 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1052 .   Nevertheless, if 10 days before the date fixed by article 1026 or by a by-law adopted in virtue of the last paragraph of the said article, for the sale of immovables, the proceedings on the sheriff\u2019s sale have been discontinued, the secretary-treasurer may sell the immovable in the usual manner. \n M.C. 1916, a. 749; 1947, c. 77, s. 29 . 1053 .   The municipality for whose benefit any immovable might be sold by the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, may, in case such immovable is advertised to be sold by the sheriff, and the proceedings upon such sale are suspended, intervene in the cause and ask and obtain the adoption of any step having for object the rendering of any final judgment. \n M.C. 1916, a. 750 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 431 . 1054 .   The action to set aside or to annul any sale under this Title, or any action to enforce any claim arising from such sale, may be instituted only against the municipality whose council or officers are in default. \n M.C. 1916, a. 751 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1055 .   Any sale made under the authority of this Title may be rescinded and set aside, with the consent of the municipalities interested, the owner and the purchaser. \n M.C. 1916, a. 752 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1056 .   No immovable sold in default of payment of taxes, under the authority of the provisions of this Title, can be again sold the following year under the authority of the same provisions. \n M.C. 1916, a. 753; 1947, c. 77, s. 30 . CHAPTER  II REDEMPTION OF IMMOVABLES SOLD FOR TAXES 1057 .   The owner of any immovable sold under Chapter I of this Title (articles 1022 to 1056) may, within two years after the date of the adjudication, redeem the same, by reimbursing to the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality in whose territory such immovable is situated, the amount laid out for the purchase of such immovable, including the cost of the certificate of purchase and the notice to the registrar, with interest at 10\u00a0% per annum, every fraction of a year being reckoned as a year. \n M.C. 1916, a. 754 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 432 . 1058 .   Any person, whether authorized or not, may, unless a deed of sale has been granted under the second paragraph of article 1044, redeem such immovable in the same manner, but only in the name and for the benefit of the person who was the owner thereof at the time of the adjudication. When the redemption is made by a person not specially authorized, the secretary-treasurer, in the receipt which he gives in duplicate, must set forth the name, style and domicile of the person effecting such redemption. Such receipt entitles the person mentioned therein to be reimbursed the amount paid by him, with interest at the rate of 8%. \n M.C. 1916, a. 755; 1938, c. 103, s. 16 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 497 . 1059 .   The secretary-treasurer must, within 15 days after the redemption is effected, give special notice thereof to the local municipality in whose territory such immovable is situated, and to the purchaser, and, on demand, he must remit to the latter the amount paid into his hands, less 2.5% on the purchase money for his fees. \n M.C. 1916, a. 756 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 433 . 1060 .   The purchaser may compel the owner, or the person who redeems the immovable in the name of the owner, to indemnify him for all necessary repairs and improvements made by him on the immovable so redeemed, even if they are then non-existent, with interest on the whole at the rate of 10\u00a0% per annum, every fraction of a year being reckoned as a year. The purchaser may retain possession of the immovable redeemed until payment of such claim. \n M.C. 1916, a. 757 ;  1992, c. 57, s. 498 . TITLE  XXVI LOANS AND BOND ISSUES CHAPTER  I HOW LOANS ARE CONTRACTED AND BONDS ISSUED 1060.1 .   Any municipality may, for any purposes within its jurisdiction, borrow sums of money by issuing bonds, notes or any other securities. \n 1992, c. 27, s. 52 . 1061 .   Every loan and every issue of bonds made by the municipality, in payment or for aid, shall be effected under a by-law, subject to any provision to the contrary. Every by-law of a local municipality referred to in the first paragraph must be approved by the qualified voters and by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. However, a loan by-law the sole purpose of which is the preparation of plans and specifications requires only the approval of the Minister. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this Code, every by-law of a regional county municipality referred to in the first paragraph must be approved by the Minister. \n M.C. 1916, a. 758; 1917-18, c. 60, s. 19 ;  1921, c. 48, s. 29; 1926, c. 34, s. 7 ;  1928, c. 94, s. 19; 1937, c. 51, s. 6 ;  1941, c. 69, s. 21; 1942, c. 69, s. 9 ;  1963 (1st sess.), c. 65, s. 10 ;  1975, c. 82, s. 35; 1977, c. 5, s. 14 ;  1979, c. 36, s. 51 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 76 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 764 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 53 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1062 .   Where a referendum poll is required pursuant to the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities ( chapter E-2.2 ), approval of the by-law of the local municipality requires not only that the number of affirmative votes be greater than the number of negative votes, but also that the total number of votes cast be equal to or greater than the following proportion of qualified voters domiciled in the territory of the municipality: ( 1 )  \u00a0 one eighth, if there are fewer than 1,000; ( 2 )  \u00a0 eight hundredths, if there are 1,000 or over but not over 2,000; ( 3 )  \u00a0 one twentieth, if there are 2,000 or over. If the result of the computation provided for in the first paragraph is a fraction, the fraction shall be counted as a unit. \n 1963 (1st sess.), c. 65, s. 11 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 77 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 764 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 434 . 1063 .   Every by-law ordering a loan must ( 1 )  \u00a0 specify its object; ( 2 )  \u00a0 contain a detailed description of the expenditure to be incurred under the by-law; ( 3 )  \u00a0 indicate the amount and term of the loan. \n M.C. 1916, a. 759; 1917-18, c. 60, s. 20 ;  1919, c. 59, s. 26; 1933, c. 118, s. 3 ;  1994, c. 33, s. 43 . 1063.1 .   Part of the loan, not exceeding 5\u00a0% of the amount of the expenditure authorized by the loan by-law in force, may be reserved for the repayment to the general fund of the municipality of all or part of the sums expended, before the passage of the loan by-law, in connection with the object of the by-law. That part of the loan must be specified in the by-law. \n 1995, c. 34, s. 49 . 1064 .   Every bond must specify: ( 1 )  \u00a0 the name of the municipality by which it is issued; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the by-law authorizing the issue thereof; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the amount for which it is given; ( 4 )  \u00a0 the rate of interest per annum; ( 5 )  \u00a0 the time and place of payment of both principal and interest; ( 6 )  \u00a0 the date of issue. It must also bear the signature of the head of the council or of any person authorized to sign it, as well as that of the secretary-treasurer.  However, if the secretary-treasurer and his assistant are absent or if they are unable or refuse to act or if the offices of secretary-treasurer and assistant secretary-treasurer are vacant, another officer or employee of the municipality designated by the council may sign the bond in their place. Every bond heretofore or hereafter issued shall be deemed to be validly signed if it bears the signature of each person who is required to sign it under this article on the date the bond bears or on the date it was signed.  The signature of the head of the council may be printed, lithographed or engraved on the bond. The signature of the secretary-treasurer may also, with the authorization of the council, be printed, lithographed or engraved on the bond. It must also contain all provisions necessary to give effect to the intentions of the by-law under which it is issued. \n M.C. 1916, a. 760; 1930, c. 104, s. 2 ;  1975, c. 82, s. 36; 1983, c. 57, s. 31 ;  1994, c. 33, s. 44 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1065 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 Unless another previous authorization has been granted by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, no municipality may sell the bonds it is authorized to issue under a by-law, otherwise than by written tender after a public notice published in the  Gazette officielle du Qu\u00e9bec  at least 15 days before the date when the tenders are to be taken into consideration at a public sitting of the council of the municipality.  The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al may, however, prescribe any other means of publication and fix, in that case, other time limits. ( 2 )  \u00a0 The council shall not, without the previous authorization of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, award the contract to any person other than the one who has made the most advantageous tender within the time fixed. ( 3 )  \u00a0 (Subarticle repealed). \n 1919, c. 59, s. 27; 1942, c. 69, s. 10 ;  1943, c. 39, s. 3; 1977, c. 53, s. 47 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 78 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1066 .   The council of a municipality may, by resolution, commission the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al to receive and open the tenders provided for in article 1065 on behalf and in the name of such municipality. Where such is the case, the tenders must be sent to or deposited at the place determined by the Minister as notified by him to the secretary-treasurer of the municipality together with the day and time fixed for the opening of the tenders. For the purposes of this article, the Minister may act through the representative designated by him. The resolution contemplated in the first paragraph binds the Minister from the time he receives certified copy of it until he receives certified copy of a resolution to the contrary. \n 1977, c. 53, s. 48 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1066.1 .   The council may, by by-law, on the conditions it determines, delegate to the secretary-treasurer the power to award the contract, in the name of the municipality, to the person entitled thereto in accordance with article 1065. \n 1995, c. 34, s. 50 . 1066.2 .   A municipality which contracts a loan by means of an issue of notes may choose the lender by following the procedure for a call for tenders, adapted as required, prescribed in article 1065. \n 1995, c. 34, s. 50 . 1067 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 761; 1927, c. 74, s. 14 ;  1966-67, c. 54, s. 6 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 79 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 705 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 51 . 1068 .   Coupons to the amount of the half-yearly interest, setting forth the place of payment, signed by the persons contemplated in article 1064, and payable to the person entitled thereto under articles 1086 and 1087 when the interest specified therein falls due, may be annexed to each bond. At the time of payment, the coupons must be handed to the secretary-treasurer; and the possession by such officer of any coupon is  prima facie  evidence that the half-yearly interest specified therein has been paid. Facsimile signatures of the officers authorized to sign the bounds, obligations or debentures may be printed, lithographed or engraved upon the coupons. \n M.C. 1916, a. 762; 1917-18, c. 60, s. 21 ;  1930, c. 103, s. 18; 1983, c. 57, s. 32 . 1069 .   The principal and interest of every bond issued by the municipality are secured by the general funds of the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 763 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1070 .   In any action upon a bond, it is not necessary either to allege or to prove the notices, by-laws, statutes or other proceedings under which such bond was issued. \n M.C. 1916, a. 764 . 1071 .   As regards the formalities necessary to ensure the validity of bonds, sections 12 and 12.1 of the Act respecting municipal debts and loans ( chapter D-7 ) shall apply. \n M.C. 1916, a. 765; 1917-18, c. 60, s. 18 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 705 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 52 . 1071.1 .   In addition to obtaining any approval required under article 1061, the municipality shall, before contracting a loan, have the conditions of the loan approved by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. However, approval of the conditions of a loan is not required in respect of a loan contracted by means of an issue of bonds, a loan contracted by means of an issue of notes following the application of the procedure for a call for tenders prescribed in article 1065, or a loan contracted by means of an issue of notes for an amount less than $100\u00a0000. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 80 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 765 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 54 ;  1995, c. 34, s. 53 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1072 .   Every by-law ordering a loan must also provide, in accordance with the following rules, for the expense incurred for interest and for the establishment of a sinking-fund. The sinking-fund may be established either by means of a special tax imposed by the by-law and levied annually, until the extinction of the debt, on all taxable immovables in the territory of the municipality or only on those the owners of which are bound to contribute to the repayment of such a loan, or by setting aside each year for that purpose a portion of the general revenues of the municipality.  In either case, the amount paid each year into the sinking-fund must be sufficient to yield, with compound interest at a rate of 3.5\u00a0% per annum, the capital to be paid at maturity. The sum necessary to provide for expense incurred for interest may likewise be taken from the general revenues or levied annually by means of a special tax imposed by the by-law on the immovables referred to in the second paragraph. Nevertheless, no municipality may, to provide for expense incurred for interest and establish the sinking-fund, use more than one-half of the ordinary revenues from the general taxes it is empowered to impose under articles 989 and following and from the business tax or the surtax or tax on non-residential immovables it is empowered to impose under the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), and the excess it may need for such purposes must be levied by means of a special tax on immovables. The sinking-fund must be collected each year, and invested according to the by-laws; and the members of the council are personally and jointly and severally responsible for the collection and investment of such fund. The annual tax may be levied from the coming into force of the by-law.  Until the bonds are issued or until the loan is contracted, the tax may be levied at a rate sufficient to pay incidental charges in respect of the loan and its object, including interest on temporary loans. Only a local municipality may impose a tax under this article. \n M.C. 1916, a. 766; 1930, c. 103, s. 19 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 81 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 55 ;  1994, c. 30, s. 96 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 435 ;  1999, c. 90, s. 8 . 1072.1 .   Where the tax imposed is not based on the value of the immovable, the by-law may provide that the ratepayer on whose immovable the tax is imposed may exempt the immovable from the tax by paying in one instalment that portion of the capital which, upon maturity of the loan, would have been provided by the tax imposed on that immovable. The share payable is calculated according to the assessment roll in force at the time the ratepayer makes the payment, taking account, where applicable, of taxes paid under the by-law before the payment. The payment must be made before the date indicated in the by-law. The amount of the loan is reduced by a sum equal to any sum paid under this article. \n 1985, c. 27, s. 68 ;  1997, c. 93, s. 93 . 1072.2 .   Any loan made by way of successive issues of negotiable instruments in accordance with section 2 of the Act respecting municipal debts and loans ( chapter D-7 ) for shorter terms than the term fixed in the by-law is, for each issue, subject to article 1072.1, adapted as required. \n 1985, c. 27, s. 68 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 705 . 1072.3 .   Any payment made under article 1072.1 or 1072.2 exempts the immovable from the special tax for the remainder of the term of the loan fixed in the by-law. \n 1985, c. 27, s. 68 . 1073 .   The secretary-treasurer must make, each year, until the payment or redemption of the bonds, a special collection roll apportioning on the taxable immovable properties liable therefor, according to their respective values as shown on such valuation roll, the amount of the tax imposed on each for the interest and for the annual payment to the sinking fund. The moneys intended for the sinking fund shall be used yearly, or, as the case may be, deposited yearly in the office of the Minister of Finance, in conformity with sections 34 to 42 of the Act respecting municipal debts and loans ( chapter D-7 ). Whenever, according to law, it is obligatory to deposit such moneys and the deposit is not made as prescribed, the Deputy Minister of Revenue, as well as any trustee, bondholder, ratepayer or other interested party may by an action in law compel the municipality to make the deposit, and in case a judgment to that effect is obtained against the municipality, the provisions of the law concerning the execution of judgments against municipalities, and contained in articles 1113 to 1127, shall apply. \n M.C. 1916, a. 767; 1917-18, c. 28, s. 6 ;  1921, c. 48, s. 30; 1953-54, c. 46, s. 1 ;  1960-61, c. 40, s. 6 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 705 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1074 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 768; 1930, c. 103, s. 20 ;  1963 (1st sess.), c. 65, s. 12 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 766 . 1075 .   The secretary-treasurer shall transmit a certified copy of the loan by-law to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, together with every other document he may require. The secretary-treasurer must provide the Minister with any information requested by him with respect to the by-law. \n M.C. 1916, a. 769; 1922 (1st sess.), c. 80, s. 12 ;  1928, c. 94, s. 20; 1930-31, c. 114, s. 7 ;  1937, c. 51, s. 7; 1979, c. 36, s. 52 ;  1982, c. 25, s. 45 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 82 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 767 ;  1988, c. 49, s. 44 ;  1989, c. 69, s. 5 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 56 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1075.1 .   (Repealed). \n 1989, c. 69, s. 6 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 57 . 1076 .   Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision, the council may amend a loan by-law by resolution requiring no approval if the amendment does not change the object of the loan and ( 1 )  \u00a0 does not increase the burden on the ratepayers or ( 2 )  \u00a0 increases the burden on the ratepayers by reason only of an increase in the rate of interest or the shortening of the term of repayment. For the purposes of the first paragraph, the burden on the ratepayers is not considered increased where the additional cost arising from a change in the borrowing method is connected with the administrative expenses of the new borrowing method and nothing else. The secretary-treasurer shall send a copy of the resolution passed under this article to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. \n 1922 (1st sess.), c. 80, s. 12; 1930, c. 103, s. 21 ;  1931-32, c. 55, s. 3; 1937, c. 51, s. 8 ;  1966-67, c. 54, s. 7; 1969, c. 82, s. 11 ;  1970, c. 64, s. 1; 1975, c. 82, s. 37 ;  1977, c. 5, s. 14 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 83 ;  1986, c. 32, s. 18 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1077 .   The council may, by by-law requiring only the approval of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, amend or replace any special tax imposed by a loan by-law under which notes, bonds or other securities have been issued. At least 30 days before it is submitted to the Minister, the amending by-law must be published in accordance with the procedure prescribed for the publication of public notices, with a notice stating that any person wishing to object to the approval of the by-law msut so inform the Minister in writing within the 30 days. If the special tax is imposed under a loan resolution, the council may proceed by resolution rather than by by-law.  This article applies,  mutatis mutandis , to the approval of the resolution. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 37; 1977, c. 5, s. 14 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 83 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 58 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1078 .   Articles 1076 and 1077 apply to every loan by-law or resolution except in the case of a temporary loan, whatever the Act under which it was passed. \n 1975, c. 82, s. 37 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 83 . 1079 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 770 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 84 . 1080 .

(Repealed). \n 1979, c. 72, s. 301 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 59 . 1082 .   A member of the council who, knowingly, by his vote or otherwise, authorizes the municipality to contract, or contracts himself on behalf of the latter, a loan exceeding the approved amount or a loan that has not received one or another of the approvals contemplated in this Title when such approval is required by law, may be declared disqualified to hold any municipal office for two years and may be held personally liable to the municipality for any loss or damage it may have suffered. The liability provided in the first paragraph is joint and several and it applies to every officer of the municipality who knowingly is a party to the unlawful act. Proceedings for the declaration of disqualification shall be taken in accordance with articles 838 to 843 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25 ); those for indemnity for loss or damage, by ordinary action.  Any ratepayer may exercise such recourses. Disqualification may also be declared by way of an action for declaration of disqualification under the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities ( chapter E-2.2 ). \n M.C. 1916, a. 772; 1975, c. 82, s. 38 ;  1977, c. 53, s. 49 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 768 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1083 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 774 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 436 . 1084 .   When the repayment of a loan is to be borne by the owners of immovable property in a part only of the territory of the municipality or by those who benefit from the works as determined under article 979, the tax to be levied each year during the term of the loan shall be assessed only on the immovables of the property owners concerned. The tax must be sufficient to pay the interest each year and make up the capital repayable at the maturity of the bonds, notes or other securities. \n 1927, c. 74, s. 15; 1928, c. 94, s. 22 ;  1979, c. 36, s. 53 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 85 ;  1985, c. 27, s. 69 ;  1986, c. 32, s. 19 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 769 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 60 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 437 . 1084.1 .   The by-law of a local municipality ordering a loan contemplated in article 1084 must be submitted for approval to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al and to the qualified voters of the designated part of the territory of the municipality or, as the case may be, that which comprises the aggregate of the immovables of those who benefit therefrom. For the purposes of the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities (chapter E-2.2), such part of the territory of the municipality is the sector concerned. \n 1987, c. 57, s. 769 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 438 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1084.2 .   Where a referendum poll is required pursuant to the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities ( chapter E-2.2 ), approval of the by-law contemplated in article 1084 requires not only that the number of affirmative votes be greater than the number of negative votes, but also that the total number of votes cast be equal to or greater than the majority of the qualified voters contemplated in that article who are domiciled in the territory of the municipality. \n 1987, c. 57, s. 769 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 456 . 1084.3 .   Where repayment of 75% or more of the loan is to be borne by the owners of immovables in only a part of the territory of the municipality or by those who benefit from the works, as determined under article 979, articles 1084.1 and 1084.2 apply as if the repayment of the entire amount of the loan were to be borne by them. For the purposes of the first paragraph, that part of the territory of the municipality shall consist of a combination of several separate parts contemplated in the by-law only in the case where the owners of immovables of none of those parts are required to bear 75% or more of the repayment of the loan; the aggregate of the immovables of those who benefit from the works shall constitute such a separate part. \n 1987, c. 57, s. 769 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 439 . 1085 .   The principal and interest of every bond shall be secured by the general fund of the municipality. \n 1947, c. 77, s. 32 . CHAPTER  II REGISTRATION OF LOAN BY-LAWS 1086 .   A bond payable to bearer may be transferred by delivery. A bond payable to a person designated thereon or to such person or to his order may be transferred by endorsement or delivery. \n M.C. 1916, a. 778; 1983, c. 57, s. 33 . 1087 .   If a bond is registered in the name of a person under the Act respecting municipal debts and loans (chapter D-7), it may be transferred only if the registration is corrected to mention the name of the transferee or to indicate that the bond is payable to bearer. That condition is added to the transfer procedure mentioned in article 1086. \n M.C. 1916, a. 779; 1983, c. 57, s. 33 ;  1988, c. 84, s. 705 . 1088 .   A transfer carried out in accordance with article 1086 and article 1087, where such is the case, shall vest the property thereof in the transferee and entitle him to bring action thereon in his own name. In any such action, it is not necessary to set forth or to prove the mode by which a person became the holder of the bond, or to set forth or to prove the notices, by-laws, or other proceedings under or by virtue of which the bond was issued.  It shall be sufficient to describe the plaintiff or applicant as the holder of the bond alleging the general endorsement or registration required by articles 1086 and 1087, if any, and shortly to state its legal effect and purport, and to make proof accordingly. \n M.C. 1916, a. 780; 1983, c. 57, s. 33 . 1089 .

Every municipality may, by resolution, order temporary loans for the payment of current administration expenses or expenses for which payment of a subsidy by the Government or one of its ministers or agencies is assured and may contract them on the conditions and for the period it determines. Every municipality may also contract temporary loans for the payment of all or part of the expenses made in respect of a loan by-law.  If, in that case, the amount exceeds 90\u00a0% of that of the bonds, notes or other securities the issue of which is authorized by the by-law, the municipality shall obtain prior authorization of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al. \n M.C. 1916, a. 784; 1927, c. 74, s. 16 ;  1947, c. 77, s. 35; 1977, c. 5, s. 14 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 88 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 61 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1093.1 .   A municipality which incurs expenses in respect of all or any part of which payment of a subsidy by the Government or one of its ministers or agencies is assured may, by by-law requiring the approval of only the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al, order a loan for an amount not exceeding the amount of the subsidy and for a term corresponding to the period fixed for the payment of the subsidy. \n 1984, c. 38, s. 88 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 62 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . CHAPTER  V WORKING FUND 1094 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 Every municipality may, with a view to placing at its disposal the moneys it needs for any purpose within its competence, constitute a fund known as the \u201cworking-fund\u201d, or increase the amount thereof; to that effect, it shall pass a by-law ( a )  \u00a0 to appropriate for that purpose the accumulated surplus of its general fund or part of it, ( b )  \u00a0 to appropriate for that purpose the revenues from a special tax provided for in the budget, or ( c )  \u00a0 to accomplish both operations. In the case of paragraph  b , the amount of the fund or its increase is equal to the revenues derived from the special tax as and when they are collected.  In the case of paragraph  c , the rule applies to that part of the fund or of its increase that is attributable to the revenues derived from the special tax. Only a local municipality may impose a tax under this subarticle. ( 1.1 )  \u00a0 In no case may the amount of the fund exceed 10\u00a0% of the appropriations provided for in the budget of the current fiscal year of the municipality.  Where, however, the amount of the fund exceeds the prescribed percentage because the budget of a subsequent fiscal year provides for less appropriations than the budget used to fix the amount of the fund, the amount may remain unchanged. ( 2 )  \u00a0 The municipality may, by resolution, borrow from the fund the moneys it may need for capital expenditures.  The resolution authorizing the loan shall indicate the term of repayment which must not exceed five years.  The municipality may also borrow from the working-fund pending the collection of revenues; in that case, the term of repayment must not exceed 12 months.  The municipality shall provide, every year, out of its general revenues, a sum sufficient to repay the loan into the working-fund. ( 3 )  \u00a0 The available moneys of such fund must be invested in accordance with article 203. ( 4 )  \u00a0 The interest on the working-fund is appropriated as ordinary revenue of the fiscal year during which it is earned. ( 5 )  \u00a0 A member of the council who, knowingly, by his vote or otherwise, authorizes: ( a )  \u00a0  the constitution of a working fund, its capital endowment, or a loan to such fund, for an amount exceeding the approved amount or while any such operation has not received one or another of the approvals contemplated in this article, when such approval is required by law; or ( b )  \u00a0 the investment of the moneys constituting such fund otherwise than in the manner prescribed in subarticle 3, may be declared disqualified to hold any municipal office for two years and may be held personally liable towards the municipality for any loss or damage suffered by it. The liability provided in the first paragraph is joint and several and it applies to every officer who knowingly is a party to the unlawful act. Proceedings for the declaration of disqualification shall be taken in accordance with articles 838 to 843 of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C-25); those for indemnity for loss or damage, by ordinary action.  Any ratepayer may exercise such recourses. Disqualification may also be declared by way of an action for declaration of disqualification under the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities (chapter E-2.2). \n 1974, c. 81, s. 10; 1975, c. 82, s. 39 ;  1977, c. 5, s. 14; 1977, c. 53, s. 50 ;  1984, c. 38, s. 89 ;  1987, c. 57, s. 770 ;  1992, c. 27, s. 63 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 440 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . CHAPTER  VI FINANCIAL RESERVES \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 . 1094.1 .   Any municipality may, by by-law, establish for the benefit of the entire territory of the municipality or of a specific sector a financial reserve for a specific purpose for the financing of expenditures other than capital expenditures. However, no regional county municipality may establish such a reserve for the benefit of a specific sector. The duration of existence of a reserve must be determined, unless the fixing of such a limit would be incompatible with the purpose for which the reserve is established. \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 ;  2000, c. 19, s. 10 . 1094.2 .   A financial reserve shall be made up of the sums allocated to it each year and interest earned on the sums. A reserve established for the benefit of the entire territory of the municipality may be made up of sums from the portion of the general fund of the municipality allocated for that purpose by the council or, in the case of a reserve established by a local municipality, of sums from a special tax provided for in the budget for that purpose and imposed on the taxable immovables in the entire territory of the municipality. A reserve established for the benefit of a specific sector may be made up only of sums from a special tax provided for in the budget for that purpose and imposed on the taxable immovables situated in that sector. \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 ;  2000, c. 19, s. 11 . 1094.3 .   The by-law establishing a financial reserve must be submitted for approval, in the case of a local municipality, to the qualified voters of the entire territory of the municipality or of the sector for whose benefit the reserve is established or, in the case of a regional county municipality, to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al.  The by-law must set out ( 1 )  \u00a0 the purpose for which the reserve is established; ( 2 )  \u00a0 the projected amount of the reserve; ( 3 )  \u00a0 the mode of financing of the reserve; ( 4 )  \u00a0 in the case of a reserve of specified duration, the duration of the existence of the reserve; ( 5 )  \u00a0 the allocation of the amount, if any, by which income exceeds expenditures at the end of the existence of the reserve. The by-law of a local municipality shall also state that the reserve is established for the benefit of the entire territory of the municipality or for the benefit of a specific sector, and shall, in the latter case, describe the limits of the sector. \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 ;  2000, c. 19, s. 12 . 1094.4 .   All expenditures necessary for the carrying out of the purpose for which the reserve was established must have been made on or before the date on which the reserve ceases to exist. The secretary-treasurer must file not later than at the last sitting of the council before that time a statement of the income and expenditures of the reserve. The council shall allocate the amount, if any, by which the reserve\u2019s income exceeds its expenditures in accordance with the provisions of the by-law under which the reserve was established.  If there is no such provision, any amount in excess shall be paid into the general fund. \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 . 1094.5 .   A by-law establishing a financial reserve may not provide for a projected amount that, if added to the projected amounts of reserves already established by by-law and still in existence, results in an amount exceeding 15\u00a0% of the other appropriations provided for in the budget of the fiscal year during which the by-law establishing the reserve is adopted. \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 . 1094.6 .   The sums allocated to a financial reserve established under this chapter must be invested in accordance with article 203. \n 1997, c. 93, s. 94 .

Every municipality may, in conformity with the expropriation procedure established by law, ( 1 )  \u00a0 expropriate any immovable, part of an immovable or servitude necessary for the carrying out of work ordered by it within its jurisdiction; ( 2 )  \u00a0 expropriate, in whole or in part, any paved or gravel road in the territory of the municipality belonging to persons, partnerships or legal persons established for a private interest; ( 3 )  \u00a0 expropriate any immovable, part of an immovable or servitude it needs for municipal purposes, including the parking of motor vehicles.

Paragraph d was replaced in 1924 (1923-24, c. 56, s. 2). Circuit Courts were abolished in 1953 (1952-53, c. 29, s. 3), and their jurisdiction transferred to the Magistrate\u2019s Court (1952-53, c. 29, s. 17), which was itself replaced in 1965 by the Provincial Court (1965, 1st sess., c. 17, s. 2), in turn replaced in 1988 by the Court of Qu\u00e9bec (1988, c. 21, s. 66). Article 693 was repealed in 1979 (1979, c. 72, s. 288). 1102 .   (Repealed). \n M.C. 1916, a. 791 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 104 . 1103 .   In the valuation of any land taken for a public road, the value of the road which has been done away with, and which is alienated gratuitously to the expropriated proprietor under article 739, and the special advantages which such proprietor derives from the new road as laid out, must be estimated and go in reduction of the compensation which may be granted for the value of such land. If the land is taken for any other public work, the advantages which the proprietor derives from such work are likewise estimated, and go in reduction of the compensation which may be granted for the value of such land. \n M.C. 1916, a. 792 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 105 . 1104 .

If there are no funds, or if those at the disposal of the secretary-treasurer are not sufficient, the council must, immediately after the service of the judgment of the court, order the secretary-treasurer, by resolution, to levy on the taxable property in the territory of the municipality liable for such judgment, a sum sufficient to pay the amount due, with interest and costs. The council may also proceed by way of a loan by-law requiring only the approval of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al.

Such writ is returnable before the same court as soon as the amount of the judgment and costs has been levied. \n M.C. 1916, a. 814 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 . 1117 .

If it is impossible for the seizing officer to obtain the valuation rolls which should serve as a basis for the collection of the moneys, or if there are no such valuation rolls, the sheriff must, without delay, proceed to make a valuation of the taxable property liable for the payment of the judgment; and he is authorized to base the apportionment or the special roll for the collection of the moneys to be levied, on such valuation as if it was the valuation given in the roll in force for such municipality. The costs incurred in making such valuation, as taxed by the court from which the writ issued, form part of the costs of execution, and are recoverable from the local municipalities in default. \n M.C. 1916, a. 818 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1121 .   The sale and adjudication of immovable property by the sheriff, in default of payment of the amount specified in the collection roll made by him, have the same effects as, but none other than, those mentioned in Title XXV (articles 1022 to 1060). The deed of sale of the immovable is signed by the warden of the regional county municipality in whose territory such immovable is then situated, in the manner prescribed in the same Title, at the expiration of two years, if the redemption of the same has not, in the meantime, been effected. \n M.C. 1916, a. 819 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 447 . 1122 .   The fees, costs and disbursements of the sheriff are taxed at the discretion of the judge of the court from which the writ of execution issued. \n M.C. 1916, a. 820 . 1123 .   The sheriff must transmit a copy of his special collection roll, and any other roll or document whereof he has taken possession, to the office of the municipality to which it belongs, after having levied the whole amount set forth in the writ of execution, together with interest and costs. \n M.C. 1916, a. 821 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1124 .   Arrears due under the apportionment or the special collection roll of the sheriff, belong to the municipality on whose behalf they should be levied, and may be recovered by such municipality, in the same manner as any other municipal tax. If any surplus remains in the hands of the sheriff, it belongs to the municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 822 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1125 .   If the municipality against which any judgment has been rendered ordering the payment of any sum of money, holds property in its own name, such property may be seized and taken in execution in the ordinary manner prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25 ). \n M.C. 1916, a. 823 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 . 1126 .   The sheriff may obtain from the court any order calculated to facilitate and ensure the complete execution of the writ which has been addressed to him. \n M.C. 1916, a. 824 . 1127 .   If any immovable advertised to be sold by the sheriff under the authority of this Title, is advertised to be sold on the same day by the secretary-treasurer of the regional county municipality, the latter cannot sell the immovable, but must forthwith transmit to the sheriff a statement of his claim and costs, which must be added to the amount claimed by the sheriff, and be levied by him at the same time as such amount. \n M.C. 1916, a. 825 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 448 . TITLE  XXXI EXCEPTIONAL PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES 1128 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 In the municipality of the county of Sherbrooke; in the local municipalities of the county of Compton, as it existed on 8 January 1894, less the municipalities of North Winslow and North Whitton; in the local municipalities of the counties of Stanstead, Brome, Missisquoi, Richmond, and in those of the county of Shefford less the municipalities of the townships of Milton and Roxton; in those of the county of Huntingdon less the municipality of the parish of Saint-Anicet; in the municipality of the township of Leeds less the municipality of East Leeds, if its municipal council passes a by-law to that effect; in the county of Megantic, as well as in the municipalities of L\u2019Avenir, South Durham, the township of Kingsey, and the township of Durham, in the county of Drummond:  all works on municipal roads and bridges are executed at the expense of the municipality in the same manner as if a by-law was passed to that effect under this Code. In the first paragraph, any reference to a county municipality or to a county means the territory in which the county corporation concerned had jurisdiction immediately before it ceased to exist and any reference to another municipality, where it is related to a reference to a county municipality or to a county, means the territory in which that other municipality had jurisdiction immediately before the county corporation having jurisdiction in the same territory ceased to exist.  However, in the case of the county of Compton and the municipalities of North Winslow and North Whitton, the date on which the territory is taken into consideration is 8 January 1894. In the first paragraph, any reference to a municipality other than a county municipality, where it is not related to a reference to such a county municipality or to a county, means the territory in which that other municipality has jurisdiction or, as the case may be, had jurisdiction immediately before it ceased to exist. The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al may assign another meaning to the references to municipalities and counties made in the first paragraph or assign other limits to any territory in which the rule set out in that paragraph applies.  Any meaning assigned pursuant to this paragraph shall prevail over a meaning assigned pursuant to the second and third paragraphs and any limits assigned pursuant to this paragraph shall prevail over any such meaning.  Any meaning or limits assigned pursuant to this paragraph may have retroactive effect to the date fixed by the Minister. Any local municipality governed by this Code whose territory includes a territory in which the rule set out in the first paragraph applies is, subject to article 1133, deemed to be referred to in this subarticle. ( 2 )  \u00a0 The local municipalities referred to in subarticle 1 may, by by-law or resolution, order that the tax imposed for such works be commutable, in whole or in part, into statute labour according to a scale or tariff at a fixed rate.  If no portion of the tax is so commuted, then the council may, each year, set apart such portion of the tax as it deems advisable, for permanent road construction or repairs the territory of the municipality; and, if only a part of the tax is commuted, then the remaining part, or such portion thereof as the council deems advisable, may in like manner be set apart.  The portion of tax so set apart must not be used for any other purpose than for permanent road construction or repairs; and if it is not all employed during the year for which it is set apart, it shall remain as a separate fund available for such use during the succeeding year or years. Such permanent work shall be carried on under the supervision of the municipal inspector. \n M.C. 1916, a. 826; 1947, c. 77, s. 36 ;  1949, c. 71, s. 13 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 449 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1129 .   ( 1 )  \u00a0 Any of the local municipalities referred to in subarticle 1 of article 1128 may also enact such provisions as it deems most equitable for the making and maintenance of the fences along municipal roads, or for ordering that such fences and all those forming an angle with the fences of such municipal roads, for a distance of 7,60\u00a0m, be, during part of the year, kept down within 30 or 60\u00a0cm of the ground. Any such by-law or order may be put into force, as the council may deem most equitable, either by compelling the owners of the adjacent lands to make fences or to take them down as aforesaid, or in any other manner. ( 2 )  \u00a0 This article does not apply to hedges, to picket fences nor to fences at a greater distance than 7,60\u00a0m from the road, nor to those which cannot be taken down or put up again without great expense. \n M.C. 1916, a. 827 ;  1984, c. 47, s. 213 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 450 . 1130 .   Any of the local municipalities referred to in subarticle 1 of article 1128 may also, by  proc\u00e8s-verbal , specify the time during which any by-road shall be made, without its being obligatory on the municipality to make any particular part of such road in any special time. \n M.C. 1916, a. 828 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 451 . 1131 .   Any of the local municipalities referred to in subarticle 1 of article 1128 may also maintain its winter roads by adopting any of the following methods: ( 1 )  \u00a0 by day labour; ( 2 )  \u00a0 by contract; ( 3 )  \u00a0 by awarding the right to perform such work to the person who made, within the time prescribed, the lowest tender or, where the council chooses to use a system of bid weighting and evaluating in accordance with article 936.0.1, the tender having obtained the highest score. For any of such purposes it may divide its territory into one or more road divisions, and may cause a special tax to be levied on each division to pay the cost of the work performed therein, or it may impose on all the taxable property situated in its territory a general tax for the payment of the whole of such work. \n M.C. 1916, a. 829 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 452 ;  1996, c. 27, s. 106 ;  1997, c. 53, s. 22 . In accordance with article 1133, the following municipality is not subject to the application of articles 1128 to 1131: Stukely-Sud (Village); (1980) 112 G.O. I, 9740. 1132 .   The local municipalities whose territory is ( 1 )  \u00a0 on \u00eele aux Coudres; ( 2 )  \u00a0 on \u00eele aux Grues; ( 3 )  \u00a0 included in that of the corporation of the county of Saguenay, as it existed immediately before such corporation ceased to exist, and situated east of the Betsiamites river, possess the attributes and powers conferred upon county corporations on 14 April 1980, in addition to those conferred upon a local municipality. \n M.C. 1916, a. 830; 1943, c. 48, s. 9 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 453 . 1133 .   The Government may, on the petition of a municipality contemplated by this Title, exempt it by letters patent from the application of one or more provisions of this Title.  The amendments made by such letters patent have the same effect as if they had been made by an Act. The petition cannot be submitted to the Government unless a notice briefly summarizing its object has been published at least one month in advance in the  Gazette officielle du Qu\u00e9bec ; within the same time, a public notice must be given in conformity with articles 431 to 433. The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Greater Montr\u00e9al shall have such letters patent published in the  Gazette officielle du Qu\u00e9bec  with a notice giving the date of their coming into force.  The Qu\u00e9bec Official Publisher shall insert in each annual volume of the Statutes of Qu\u00e9bec a table giving the date of the coming into force of the letters patent granted before such volume is printed and the legislative provisions they repeal. \n 1979, c. 36, s. 54 ;  1996, c. 2, s. 455 ;  1999, c. 40, s. 60 ;  1999, c. 43, s. 13 . 1134 .
