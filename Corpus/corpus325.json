This information includes, but is not limited to, information about current and  previous employment, as well as financial and criminal disclosure.  \n After an  individual becomes registered, if any of the information provided in their  initial application changes, they must update their information using the  prescribed form and within the time periods provided for in National Instrument  33-109  Registration Information .  \n If an individual  discloses false or misleading information to CSA staff, the matter may result  in a denial of registration or in regulatory action being taken against a  registrant. False or misleading statements made during the application process  may also constitute a provincial or criminal offence. CSA staff may also take  regulatory action against anyone complicit in an applicant\u2019s delivery of a  false or misleading application, including the sponsoring firm.\u00a0  \n The CSA also  published today  CSA Staff Notice 31-349  Change  to Standard Form Reports for Close Supervision and Strict Supervision Terms and  Conditions , which relates to dealing representatives that require enhanced  supervision on their trading activities. The notice describes close and strict  supervision and outlines changes to standard form reports. \n The notices can  be found on CSA members\u2019 websites. \n The CSA, the  council of the securities regulators of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories,  co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets. \n - 30 - \n For more information: \n Kristen\n            Rose \n            Ontario Securities Commission \n            416-593-2336 \n Hilary McMeekin \n            Alberta Securities Commission \n            403-592-8186   \n            Alison Walker \n            British Columbia Securities Commission \n            604-899-6713  \n            Sylvain Th\u00e9berge \n            Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers \n            514-940-2176\n Jason (Jay) Booth \n            Manitoba Securities Commission \n            204-945-1660 \n Andrew\n            Nicholson \n            Financial and Consumer Services \n            Commission, New Brunswick \n            506-658-3021\n David Harrison \n            Nova Scotia Securities Commission \n            902-424-8586\n Steve Dowling \n            Government of Prince Edward Island, \n            Superintendent of Securities              \u00a0 \n            902-368-6288 \n            John O\u2019Brien \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            Newfoundland and Labrador \n            709-729-4909\n            Rhonda Horte \n            Office of the Yukon Superintendent \n            of Securities \n            867-667-5466\n            Jeff Mason \n            Nunavut Securities Office \n            867-975-6591 \n Tom\n            Hall \n            Northwest Territories Securities Office \n            867-767-9305\n            Shannon McMillan \n            Financial and Consumer Affairs \n            Authority of Saskatchewan \n            306-798-4160\n Contact  | \n                                     Legal  |\n                                     Legislation  |\n                                     Accessibility  |\n                                     Fran\u00e7ais \n \u00a9 Ontario Securities Commission 2017 \n Government of Ontario \n JavaScript is disabled or not supported by this browser.
