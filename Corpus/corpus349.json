If the site itself is down, there's not much you can do but wait. If you can load the site on other computers or devices, there may be an issue with your computer or network. There are some quick fixes that will solve most problems, but you may have to get your hands a little dirty. Fixing an issue that prevents you from accessing a particular website may require an antivirus or malware scan, and you may also need to check your browser settings or change your DNS settings if these scans do not remedy the problem. \n Steps Edit \n Part One of Five: Basic Troubleshooting Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/76\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/7\\/76\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Try loading the site on a different device or network if possible you can try your mobile network.  Try loading the website on your phone or on another computer. If the website loads on the other device, the problem lies with your computer. If the website doesn't load on another device, the problem is either with the network or the website itself.\n If you can, try to load the website on another device connected to your network, and a device that's not connected to your network. The easiest way to do this is to load the website on your phone while connected to the same network as your computer, and then disconnect from the wireless network and load the page using your cellular data. This can help you determine if the problem is with your network or with the website. \n If the website won't load on any device regardless of what network it is connected to, the website itself is most likely down. You can double-check by looking up the site on a monitoring service like \"Is It Down Right Now?\" ( iidrn.com ). \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/18\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/1\\/18\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 2 \n Restart your computer.

There may be some settings configured incorrectly on your browser. Try a different web browser to see if you can load the website.\n If you are using the default browser and don't have any others installed, you can quickly download and install another free browser like  Firefox ,  Chrome , or  Opera . \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/7\\/77\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Temporarily disable your antivirus program.

If your date or time is set incorrectly, you may not be able to connect to secure ( https:// ) websites. Check your computer or mobile device's clock to make sure that it is set to the correct time and date.

The DNS (Domain Name System) is the service that translates web domain names into IP addresses so that you can connect to websites. If your local DNS files have been corrupted, you may not be able to load certain websites. Flushing your DNS will clear out your local DNS information and load a fresh copy. [5] \n Windows - Press  \u229e  Win + R  and type  cmd  to open the Command Prompt. Type  ipconfig /flushdns  and press  \u21b5  Enter . You will receive a message that the DNS cache has been flushed, and you can close the Command Prompt. \n Mac - Open the Terminal from the Utilities folder. Type  dscacheutil -flushcache  and press  \u23ce  Return . Then type  sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder  and press  \u23ce  Return  to restart the DNS service.

Typically you'll connect to the DNS provided by your internet service provider, but there are many more options. Some may even result in faster browsing. Perform a web search for \"free DNS list\" to find up-to-date listings of free DNS providers. You can typically find speed comparisons as well.\n There will typically be two addresses: the Primary and the Secondary. You'll need both in a moment. \n Note that not all public DNSs allow access to the same content. It's recommended that you use Google or OpenDNS for the most accessibility. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/66\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-26-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-26-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/6\\/66\\/Fix-if-You-Can%27t-Access-a-Particular-Website-Step-26-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n Connect to a new DNS.

Just enter the page's URL to see whether they have any archived versions of it. If they do, you'll get a calendar with links. If you do need to interact, check if the problem is on your end by testing the page on a different computer or network. If it still won't load, then the issue is on their end and there's nothing you can do. \n Thanks! \n 16 \n 16 \n If I can't connect to a certain website no matter what device I use, does that mean the site is blocked or down? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswered by  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twikiHow Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Go to iidrn.com.

Some countries block access to certain websites for everyone. If you're a child or teenager, your parents might have set up parental controls to prevent you from accessing inappropriate content. Otherwise, your antivirus program could be blocking the site because it is a threat somehow. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 2 \n No matter what I do, it still won't load.
