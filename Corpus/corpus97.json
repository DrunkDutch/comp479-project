Introduction \n CSS beyond level 2 is a set of modules, divided up to allow the\n   specifications to develop incrementally, along with their implementations.\n   This specification is one of those modules.\n    This module describes CSS properties which allow authors to specify the\n   foreground color and opacity of an element. This module also describes in\n   detail the CSS <color> value type.\n   It not only defines the color-related properties and values that already\n   exist in  CSS1  and  CSS2 , but also defines new\n   properties and values.\n   The Working Group doesn't expect that all implementations of CSS3 will\n   implement all properties or values. Instead, there will probably be a\n   small number of variants of CSS3, so-called \"profiles\". For example, it\n   may be that only the profile for 32-bit color user agents will include all\n   of the proposed color-related properties and values.\n   The specification is the result of the merging of relevant parts of the\n   following Recommendations and Working Drafts, and the addition of some new\n   features.\n HTML 4.01  [HTML401] \n CSS 2.0  [CSS2] \n SVG 1.0  [SVG10] \n User Interface for CSS3 (16 February 2000)  [CSS3UI] \n 2.  Dependencies \n Additional terminology is defined in the  Definitions \n   section of  [CSS21] .\n   Examples of document source code and fragments are given in XML  [XML10]  or HTML  [HTML401]  syntax.\n   3.  Color properties \n 3.1.  Foreground color: the\n   \u2018 color \u2019\n   property \n Name: \n color \n Value: \n <color> | inherit\n Initial: \n depends on user agent\n Applies\u00a0to: \n all elements\n Inherited: \n yes\n Percentages: \n N/A\n Media: \n visual\n Computed value: \n The computed value for basic color keywords, RGB hex values and\n        extended color keywords is the equivalent triplet of numerical RGB\n        values, e.g.  six digit hex value or rgb(...)\n        functional value , with an alpha value of 1.\n        The computed value of the keyword \u2018 transparent \u2019 is the\n        quadruplet of all zero numerical RGBA values, e.g.  rgba(0,0,0,0) .\n        See the definition of the \u2018 currentColor \u2019 for how its computed\n        value is determined.\n        For all other values, the computed value is the specified value.\n This property describes the foreground color of an element's text\n   content. In addition it is used to provide a potential indirect value ( currentColor )\n   for any  other  properties that accept color values. If the\n   \u2018 currentColor \u2019 keyword is set on\n   the \u2018 color \u2019\n   property itself, it is treated as \u2018 color:\n   inherit \u2019.\n    There are different ways to specify lime green:\n Example(s): \nem { color: lime }               /* color keyword */\nem { color: rgb(0,255,0) }       /* RGB range 0-255   */\n <color> \n Color units are defined in a  following \n    section.\n 3.2.  Transparency: the\n   \u2018 opacity \u2019\n   property \n  Opacity can be thought of as a postprocessing operation. Conceptually,\n   after the element (including its descendants) is rendered into an RGBA\n   offscreen image, the opacity setting specifies how to blend the offscreen\n   rendering into the current composite rendering. See  simple alpha compositing  for details.\n Name: \n opacity \n Value: \n <alphavalue> | inherit\n Initial: \n 1\n Applies\u00a0to: \n all elements\n Inherited: \n no\n Percentages: \n N/A\n Media: \n visual\n Computed value: \n The same as the specified value after clipping the\n      <alphavalue> to the range [0.0,1.0].\n <alphavalue> \n Syntactically a <number>. The uniform opacity setting to be\n    applied across an entire object. Any values outside the range 0.0 (fully\n    transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque) will be clamped to this range. If the\n    object is a container element, then the effect is as if the contents of\n    the container element were blended against the current background using a\n    mask where the value of each pixel of the mask is <alphavalue>.\n Since an element with opacity less than 1 is composited from a single\n   offscreen image, content outside of it cannot be layered in z-order\n   between pieces of content inside of it. For the same reason,\n   implementations must create a new stacking context for any element with\n   opacity less than 1. If an element with opacity less than 1 is not\n   positioned, implementations must paint the layer it creates, within its\n   parent stacking context, at the same stacking order that would be used if\n   it were a positioned element with \u2018 z-index:\n   0 \u2019 and \u2018 opacity: 1 \u2019. If an\n   element with opacity less than 1 is positioned, the \u2018 z-index \u2019 property applies as described in  [CSS21] , except that\n   \u2018 auto \u2019 is treated as \u2018 0 \u2019 since a new stacking context is always created.\n   See  section\n   9.9  and  Appendix\n   E  of  [CSS21]  for\n   more information on stacking contexts. The rules in this paragraph do not\n   apply to SVG elements, since SVG has its own  rendering model  ( [SVG11] , Chapter 3).\n   4.  Color units \n A  <color>  is\n   either a keyword or a numerical specification.\n   4.1.  Basic color keywords \n The list of basic color keywords is: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray,\n   green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and\n   yellow. The color names are case-insensitive.\n Color names and  sRGB \n    values \n Named\n      Numeric\n      Color\u00a0name\n      Hex\u00a0rgb\n      Decimal\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      black \n #000000\n      0,0,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      silver \n #C0C0C0\n      192,192,192\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      gray \n #808080\n      128,128,128\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      white \n #FFFFFF\n      255,255,255\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      maroon \n #800000\n      128,0,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      red \n #FF0000\n      255,0,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      purple \n #800080\n      128,0,128\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      fuchsia \n #FF00FF\n      255,0,255\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      green \n #008000\n      0,128,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      lime \n #00FF00\n      0,255,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      olive \n #808000\n      128,128,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      yellow \n #FFFF00\n      255,255,0\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      navy \n #000080\n      0,0,128\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      blue \n #0000FF\n      0,0,255\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      teal \n #008080\n      0,128,128\n \u00a0\n      \u00a0\n      aqua \n #00FFFF\n      0,255,255\n Example(s): \nbody {color: black; background: white }\nh1 { color: maroon }\nh2 { color: olive }\n 4.2.  Numerical color values \n 4.2.1.  RGB color values \n The  RGB color\n   model  is used in numerical color specifications. These examples all\n   specify the same color:\n Example(s): \nem { color: #f00 }              /* #rgb */\nem { color: #ff0000 }           /* #rrggbb */\nem { color: rgb(255,0,0) }\nem { color: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%) }\n  The format of an RGB value in hexadecimal notation is a \u2018 # \u2019 immediately followed by either three or six\n   hexadecimal characters. The three-digit RGB notation ( #rgb ) is converted into six-digit form\n   ( #rrggbb ) by replicating digits,\n   not by adding zeros. For example, #fb0 expands to #ffbb00. This ensures\n   that white (#ffffff) can be specified with the short notation (#fff) and\n   removes any dependencies on the color depth of the display.\n    The format of an RGB value in the functional notation is \u2018 rgb( \u2019 followed by a comma-separated list of three\n   numerical values (either three integer values or three percentage values)\n   followed by \u2018 ) \u2019. The integer value 255\n   corresponds to 100%, and to F or FF in the hexadecimal notation:\n   rgb(255,255,255) = rgb(100%,100%,100%) = #FFF. White space characters are\n   allowed around the numerical values.\n   All RGB colors are specified in the  sRGB  color space (see  [SRGB] ). User agents may vary in the\n   fidelity with which they represent these colors, but using sRGB provides\n   an unambiguous and objectively measurable definition of what the color\n   should be, which can be related to international standards (see  [COLORIMETRY] ).\n   Values outside the device gamut should be clipped or mapped into the\n   gamut when the gamut is known: the red, green, and blue values must be\n   changed to fall within the range supported by the device. User agents may\n   perform higher quality mapping of colors from one gamut to another. This\n   specification does not define precise clipping behavior. For a typical CRT\n   monitor, whose device gamut is the same as sRGB, the four rules below are\n   equivalent:\n Example(s): \nem { color: rgb(255,0,0) }       /* integer range 0 - 255 */\nem { color: rgb(300,0,0) }       /* clipped to rgb(255,0,0) */\nem { color: rgb(255,-10,0) }     /* clipped to rgb(255,0,0) */\nem { color: rgb(110%, 0%, 0%) }  /* clipped to rgb(100%,0%,0%) */\n Other devices, such as printers, have different gamuts than sRGB; some\n   colors outside the 0..255 sRGB range will be representable (inside the\n   device gamut), while other colors inside the 0..255 sRGB range will be\n   outside the device gamut and will thus be mapped.\n   4.2.2.  RGBA color values \n The  RGB color model is\n   extended in this specification to include \u201calpha\u201d to allow\n   specification of the opacity of a color. See  simple alpha\n   compositing  for details. These examples all specify the same\n   color: \n Example(s): \nem { color: rgb(255,0,0) }      /* integer range 0 - 255 */\nem { color: rgba(255,0,0,1)     /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */\nem { color: rgb(100%,0%,0%) }   /* float range 0.0% - 100.0% */\nem { color: rgba(100%,0%,0%,1) } /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */\n Unlike RGB values, there is no hexadecimal notation for an RGBA value.\n    The format of an RGBA value in the functional notation is \u2018 rgba( \u2019 followed by a comma-separated list of three\n   numerical values (either three integer values or three percentage values),\n   followed by an  <alphavalue> , followed by \u2018 ) \u2019. The integer value 255 corresponds to 100%,\n   rgba(255,255,255,0.8) = rgba(100%,100%,100%,0.8). White space characters\n   are allowed around the numerical values.\n   Implementations must clip the red, green, and blue components of RGBA\n   color values to the device gamut according to the rules for the RGB color\n   value composed of those components.\n   These examples specify effects that are possible with the rgba()\n   notation:\n Example(s): \np { color: rgba(0,0,255,0.5) }        /* semi-transparent solid blue */\np { color: rgba(100%, 50%, 0%, 0.1) } /* very transparent solid orange */\n Note.  If RGBA values are not supported by a\n   user agent, they should be treated like unrecognized values per the CSS\n   forward compatibility parsing rules ( [CSS21] , Chapter 4). RGBA values must\n    not  be treated as simply an RGB value with the opacity ignored.\n   4.2.3.  \u2018 transparent \u2019\n   color keyword \n CSS1 introduced the \u2018 transparent \u2019 value for the background-color\n   property. CSS2 allowed border-color to also accept the \u2018 transparent \u2019\n   value. The Open eBook(tm) Publication Structure 1.0.1  [OEB101]  extended the \u2018 color \u2019 property to\n   also accept the \u2018 transparent \u2019 keyword. CSS3 extends the color\n   value to include the \u2018 transparent \u2019 keyword to allow its use with all\n   properties that accept a <color> value. This simplifies the\n   definition of those properties in CSS3.\n transparent \n Fully transparent. This keyword can be considered a shorthand for\n    transparent black, rgba(0,0,0,0), which is its computed value.\n 4.2.4.  HSL color values \n CSS3 adds numerical  hue-saturation-lightness (HSL) colors as a complement to\n   numerical RGB colors. It has been observed that RGB colors have the\n   following limitations:  \n RGB is hardware-oriented: it reflects the use of CRTs.\n    RGB is non-intuitive. People can learn how to use RGB, but actually by\n    internalizing how to translate hue, saturation and lightness, or\n    something similar, to RGB.\n  There are several other color schemes possible. Some advantages of HSL\n   are that it is symmetrical to lightness and darkness (which is not the\n   case with HSV for example), and it is trivial to convert HSL to RGB.\n    HSL colors are encoding as a triple (hue, saturation, lightness). Hue\n   is represented as an angle of the color circle (i.e. the rainbow\n   represented in a circle). This angle is so typically measured in degrees\n   that the unit is implicit in CSS; syntactically, only a <number> is\n   given. By definition red=0=360, and the other colors are spread around the\n   circle, so green=120, blue=240, etc. As an angle, it implicitly wraps\n   around such that -120=240 and 480=120. One way an implementation could\n   normalize such an angle x to the range [0,360) ( i.e.  zero\n   degrees, inclusive, to 360 degrees, exclusive) is to compute (((x mod 360)\n   + 360) mod 360). Saturation and lightness are represented as percentages.\n   100% is full saturation, and 0% is a shade of gray. 0% lightness is black,\n   100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is \u201cnormal\u201d.\n   So for instance:\n Example(s): \n* { color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%) }   /* red */\n* { color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%) } /* lime */ \n* { color: hsl(120, 100%, 25%) } /* dark green */ \n* { color: hsl(120, 100%, 75%) } /* light green */ \n* { color: hsl(120, 75%, 75%) }  /* pastel green, and so on */\n  The advantage of HSL over RGB is that it is far more intuitive: you can\n   guess at the colors you want, and then tweak. It is also easier to create\n   sets of matching colors (by keeping the hue the same and varying the\n   lightness/darkness, and saturation)\n   If saturation is less than 0%, implementations must clip it to 0%. If\n   the resulting value is outside the device gamut, implementations must clip\n   it to the device gamut. This clipping should preserve the hue when\n   possible, but is otherwise undefined. (In other words, the clipping is\n   different from applying the rules for clipping of RGB colors after\n   applying the algorithm below for converting HSL to RGB.)\n    The algorithm to translate HSL to RGB is simple (here expressed in ABC\n    [ABC]  which was used to\n   generate the tables.) In these algorithms, all three values (H, S and L)\n   have been normalized to fractions 0..1:\n    HOW TO RETURN hsl.to.rgb(h, s, l): \n       SELECT: \n\t  l<=0.5: PUT l*(s+1) IN m2\n\t  ELSE: PUT l+s-l*s IN m2\n       PUT l*2-m2 IN m1\n       PUT hue.to.rgb(m1, m2, h+1/3) IN r\n       PUT hue.to.rgb(m1, m2, h    ) IN g\n       PUT hue.to.rgb(m1, m2, h-1/3) IN b\n       RETURN (r, g, b)\n    HOW TO RETURN hue.to.rgb(m1, m2, h): \n       IF h<0: PUT h+1 IN h\n       IF h>1: PUT h-1 IN h\n       IF h*6<1: RETURN m1+(m2-m1)*h*6\n       IF h*2<1: RETURN m2\n       IF h*3<2: RETURN m1+(m2-m1)*(2/3-h)*6\n       RETURN m1\n 4.2.4.1.  HSL examples \n  Each table below represents one hue. Twelve equally spaced colors (i.e.\n   at 30\u00b0 intervals) have been chosen from the color circle: red, yellow,\n   green, cyan, blue, magenta, with all the intermediate colors (the last is\n   the color between magenta and red).\n    The X axis of each table represents the saturation (100%, 75%, 50%,\n   25%, 0%).\n    The Y axis represents the lightness. 50% is \u201cnormal\u201d.\n 0\u00b0

has the\n   \u2018 rgba() \u2019 alpha counterpart, the\n   \u2018 hsl() \u2019 functional notation has the\n   \u2018 hsla() \u2019 alpha counterpart.  See\n    simple alpha compositing  for details. These examples\n   specify the same color:\n Example(s): \nem { color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%) }     /* green */\nem { color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 1) } /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */\n The format of an HSLA color value in the functional notation is\n   \u2018 hsla( \u2019 followed by the hue in degrees,\n   saturation and lightness as a percentage, and an  <alphavalue> , followed\n   by \u2018 ) \u2019. White space characters are\n   allowed around the numerical values.\n   Implementations must clip the hue, saturation, and lightness components\n   of HSLA color values to the device gamut according to the rules for the\n   HSL color value composed of those components.\n   These examples specify effects that are possible with the hsla()\n   notation:\n Example(s): \np { color: hsla(240, 100%, 50%, 0.5) } /* semi-transparent solid blue */\np { color: hsla(30, 100%, 50%, 0.1) }  /* very transparent solid orange */\n 4.3.  Extended color keywords \n The table below provides a list of the X11 colors  [X11COLORS]  supported by popular\n   browsers with the addition of gray/grey variants from SVG 1.0. The\n   resulting list is precisely the same as the  SVG 1.0 color\n   keyword names . This specification extends their definition beyond SVG.\n   The two color swatches on the left illustrate setting the background color\n   of a table cell in two ways: The first column uses the named

currentColor \u2019\n   color keyword \n CSS1 and CSS2 defined the initial value of  the \u2018 border-color \u2019 property  to be  the value of the\n   \u2018 color \u2019\n   property  but did not define a corresponding keyword. This omission was\n   recognized by SVG, and thus  SVG 1.0\n   introduced the \u2018 currentColor \u2019 value \n   for the \u2018 fill \u2019, \u2018 stroke \u2019, \u2018 stop-color \u2019, \u2018 flood-color \u2019, and \u2018 lighting-color \u2019 properties. CSS3 extends the\n   color value to include the \u2018 currentColor \u2019 keyword to allow its use with all\n   properties that accept a <color> value. This simplifies the\n   definition of those properties in CSS3.\n currentColor \n The value of the \u2018 color \u2019 property. The computed value of\n    the \u2018 currentColor \u2019 keyword is the computed value of\n    the \u2018 color \u2019\n    property. If the \u2018 currentColor \u2019 keyword is set on the \u2018 color \u2019 property\n    itself, it is treated as \u2018 color:\n    inherit \u2019.\n 4.5.  CSS system colors \n 4.5.1.  CSS2 system colors \n Deprecated.   In addition to being able to assign color keyword\n   values to text, backgrounds, etc.,  CSS2 \n   allowed authors to specify colors in a manner that integrated them into\n   the user's graphic environment. \n For systems that do not have a corresponding value, the specified value\n   should be mapped to the nearest system color value, or to a default color.\n   Note that some profiles of CSS may not support System Colors at all.\n   The following lists additional values for color-related CSS values and\n   their general meaning. Any color property can take one of the following\n   names. Although these are case-insensitive, it is recommended that the\n   mixed capitalization shown below be used, to make the names more legible.\n ActiveBorder \n Active window border.\n    ActiveCaption \n Active window caption.\n    AppWorkspace \n Background color of multiple document interface.\n    Background \n Desktop background.\n    ButtonFace \n The face background color for 3-D elements that appear 3-D due to one\n    layer of surrounding border.\n    ButtonHighlight \n The color of the border facing the light source for 3-D elements that\n    appear 3-D due to one layer of surrounding border.\n    ButtonShadow \n The color of the border away from the light source for 3-D elements\n    that appear 3-D due to one layer of surrounding border.\n    ButtonText \n Text on push buttons.\n    CaptionText \n Text in caption, size box, and scrollbar arrow box.\n    GrayText \n Grayed (disabled) text. This color is set to #000 if the current\n    display driver does not support a solid gray color.\n    Highlight \n Item(s) selected in a control.\n    HighlightText \n Text of item(s) selected in a control.\n    InactiveBorder \n Inactive window border.\n    InactiveCaption \n Inactive window caption.\n    InactiveCaptionText \n Color of text in an inactive caption.\n    InfoBackground \n Background color for tooltip controls.\n    InfoText \n Text color for tooltip controls.\n    Menu \n Menu background.\n    MenuText \n Text in menus.\n    Scrollbar \n Scroll bar gray area.\n    ThreeDDarkShadow \n The color of the darker (generally outer) of the two borders away from\n    the light source for 3-D elements that appear 3-D due to two concentric\n    layers of surrounding border.\n    ThreeDFace \n The face background color for 3-D elements that appear 3-D due to two\n    concentric layers of surrounding border.\n    ThreeDHighlight \n The color of the lighter (generally outer) of the two borders facing\n    the light source for 3-D elements that appear 3-D due to two concentric\n    layers of surrounding border.\n    ThreeDLightShadow \n The color of the darker (generally inner) of the two borders facing\n    the light source for 3-D elements that appear 3-D due to two concentric\n    layers of surrounding border.\n    ThreeDShadow \n The color of the lighter (generally inner) of the two borders away\n    from the light source for 3-D elements that appear 3-D due to two\n    concentric layers of surrounding border.\n    Window \n Window background.\n    WindowFrame \n Window frame.\n    WindowText \n Text in windows.\n DEPRECATED EXAMPLE(S):\n     For example, to set the foreground and background colors of a\n    paragraph to the same foreground and background colors of the user's\n    window, write the following: \np { color: WindowText; background-color: Window }\n Note.  The CSS2 System Color values have been\n   deprecated in favor of the CSS3 UI \u2018 appearance \u2019 property. If you want to\n   emulate the look of a user interface related element or control, please\n   use the \u2018 appearance \u2019 property\n   instead of attempting to mimic a user interface element through a\n   combination of system colors.\n   4.6.  Notes on using colors \n Although colors can add significant amounts of information to document\n   and make them more readable, please consider the W3C Web Content\n   Accessibility Guidelines  [WCAG20]  when including color in your\n   documents.\n 1.4.1\n    Use of Color:  Color is not used as the only visual means of\n    conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or\n    distinguishing a visual element \n 5.  Simple alpha compositing \n When drawing, implementations must  handle alpha  according to the\n   rules in  Section\n   14.2 Simple alpha compositing  of  [SVG11] . (If the \u2018 color-interpolation \u2019 or\n   \u2018 color-rendering \u2019 properties\n   mentioned in that section are not implemented or do not apply,\n   implementations must act as though they have their initial values.)\n   6.  Sample style sheet for (X)HTML \n This appendix is informative, not normative. This style sheet could be\n   used by an implementation as part of its default styling of HTML4, XHTML1,\n   XHTML1.1, XHTML Basic, and other XHTML Family documents.\nhtml { \n\tcolor: black;\n\tbackground: white;\n}\n/* traditional desktop user agent colors for hyperlinks */\n:link    { color: blue; }   \n:visited { color: purple; }\n/* default focus outline */\n:focus {\n\toutline: 1px dotted;  /* or 1px dotted invert */\n}\n 7.  Profiles \n Each specification using  CSS3 Color  must\n   define the subset of CSS3 Color features it allows and excludes, and\n   describe the local meaning of all the components of that subset.\n   Non normative examples:\n CSS3 Color \n       profile\n Specification\n       HTML4\n Accepts\n       Basic color keywords  \n       RGB six digit hex color values\n Excludes\n        \u2018 color \u2019 property \n       \u2018 opacity \u2019 property \n       RGB three digit hex color values and RGB functional notation color\n       value \n       RGBA color values \n       HSL and HSLA color values \n       Extended color keywords \n       \u2018 currentColor \u2019 color value \n       CSS2 UI Colors \n       \u2018 transparent \u2019 color value\n Extra constraints\n       none.\n CSS3 Color \n       profile\n Specification\n       CSS level 1\n Accepts\n        \u2018 color \u2019 property  \n       Basic color keywords  \n       RGB color values\n Excludes\n        \u2018 opacity \u2019 property \n       RGBA color values \n       HSL and HSLA color values \n       Extended color keywords \n       \u2018 currentColor \u2019 color value \n       CSS2 UI Colors \n       \u2018 transparent \u2019 color value\n Extra constraints\n       none.\n CSS3 Color \n       profile\n Specification\n       CSS level 2\n Accepts\n        \u2018 color \u2019 property  \n       Basic color keywords \n       RGB color values \n       CSS2 UI Colors \n       \u2018 transparent \u2019 color value\n Excludes\n        \u2018 opacity \u2019 property \n       RGBA color values \n       HSL and HSLA color values \n       Extended color keywords \n       \u2018 currentColor \u2019 color value\n Extra constraints\n       \u2018 transparent \u2019 color value not valid for\n       \u2018 color \u2019\n       property. \n       \u2018 orange \u2019\n       color value (part of Extended color keywords) is accepted in CSS level\n       2 revision 1\n CSS3 Color \n       profile\n Specification\n       SVG 1.0 and 1.1\n Accepts\n        \u2018 color \u2019 property \n       \u2018 opacity \u2019 property \n       Basic color keywords \n       RGB color values \n       CSS2 UI Colors \n       Extended color keywords \n       \u2018 currentColor \u2019 color value\n Excludes\n        RGBA color values \n       HSL and HSLA color values \n       \u2018 transparent \u2019 color value\n Extra constraints\n       \u2018 currentColor \u2019 color value not valid for\n       \u2018 color \u2019\n       property.\n 8.  Test suite \n A CSS Color Module  Test Suite  has\n   been developed, although further tests may be added. This test suite is\n   intended to allow user agents to verify their basic conformance to the\n   specification. This test suite does not pretend to be exhaustive and does\n   not cover all possible numerical color values. These tests are available\n   at  http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS3/Color/current/ .\n   9.  Call for Implementations of\n   dropped features \n  A number of features that were present in the 14\n   May 2003 Candidate Recommendation are no longer present in this\n   specification. However, the call for implementations for these features\n   remains, and they may be included in a future level of this specification\n   given sufficient implementations and a test suite to demonstrate\n   interoperability. These features are:\n ICC\n    Color Profile: the \u2018 color-profile \u2019 property \n The\n    \u2018 rendering-intent \u2019 property \n The\n    \u2018 @color-profile \u2019 at-rule \n \u2018 flavor \u2019 system color \n 10.
