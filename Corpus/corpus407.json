KZR 39/06) is a decision issued on May 6, 2009 by the  Federal Court of Justice of Germany  ( German :  Bundesgerichtshof , BGH) on the interaction between  patent law  and  standards , and more generally between  intellectual property law  and  competition law . The Court held that a defendant, accused of  patent infringement  and who was not able to obtain a  license  from the patentee, may defend himself, under certain conditions, by invoking an  abuse of a dominant market position . [1] \n The name \"Orange-Book-Standard\" comes from the  Orange Book  that contained the format specifications for  CD-Rs , the technology at issue in the case that led to the Orange-Book-Standard decision.
