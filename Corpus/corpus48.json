I adopted a vast amount of knowledge working in both sales and management all the while learning the importance of leadership and positive workplace relationships. One of the company\u2019s core values is their dedication to their clientele and employees which explains why they are the largest equipment rental company in North America. Throughout my internship, I have had the support and guidance of my colleagues which has encouraged and taught me to strive and contribute my absolute best. Thank you JMSB for assisting me in finding this incredible opportunity. \n Melissa Petosa \n 2nd year GDBA student \n When I decided to pursue a formal business education to complement my professional experience and develop my managerial skills, I had no doubt that the GDBA was the right choice for me because of JMSB\u2019s great reputation. \n Being both challenged and supported, enabled me to achieve my best and to strive to be better. The amazing exchanges with professors, career advisors and peers not only developed my analytical thinking and a management skill set, but also expanded my professional network, and added wonderful people to my circle of friends.\u00a0 \n Mariana Bitiato \n GDBA '16 \n Product and Production Manager - Hasbro \n Concordia's GDBA/GCBA program offers an excellent crash-course into the world of business, regardless of your background. When I enrolled, it had been over 10 years since I had studied anything outside of the health science field!  \n The program offers flexibility to accommodate different schedules, and covers the spectrum of business elements, from marketing to accounting, as well as teaching \u201csoft skills\u201d. What most struck me about the program was how the content is transferable to various facets of your life \u2013 you don\u2019t need to be in business to do business!  \n Whether it is improving your communication skills with coworkers or family members, or just better managing your own personal budget, the GCBA/GDBA curriculum offers far-reaching benefits. Of course, the reality is that many careers do come in contact with elements of business administration, so the certificate or diploma from JMSB can directly impact your professional development as well!  \n Every course I took has in some way influenced my behaviour in both my personal and professional life. I\u2019m proud to support these programs, and encourage others to consider enrolling!\u00a0 \n Chris von Roretz \n GCBA '14 - RI-MUHC Program \n Biology Teacher - John Abbott College \n Educational background \n Country/Region of origin \n Graduate Diploma/Certificate in Business Administration The John Molson GDBA/GCBA Advantage Program details Curriculum RI-MUHC partnership Admissions Tuition & fees Beyond the classroom Alumni profiles Current students \n How to apply \n Join our mailing list \n Get started \n Attend an info session/event \n Connect with a recruiter \n Download program brochure \n Contact us \n Featured events \n See all \n Upcoming \n Nov. 28 \n EMBA Information Session  \n 6 p.m. \u2014 8 p.m. \n Upcoming \n Dec. 05 \n MBA Information Session \n 6 p.m. \u2014 8 p.m. \n 2018 \n Jan. 17 \n Graduate Diploma/Certificate in Business Administration Information Session \n 6 p.m. \u2014 7:30 p.m. \n 2018 \n Jan. 30 \n MBA Information Session \n 6 p.m. \u2014 8 p.m. \n Join the conversation \n John Molson School of Business\r\n @JMSBConcordia #JMSB #GDBA\r\n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About JMSB \n Programs \n Research \n Services & facilities \n Student life \n News & events \n Future students \n Current students \n Employers \n Organizations \n Alumni \n John Molson School of Business \n1450 Guy St. \nMontreal, Quebec, Canada\u00a0 \n H3H 0A1 \n See campus map \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
