I am NOT an expert! \nPlease let me know if you know of others. \nThanks to correspondents who have supplied data, especially Mike Dawes\n (TMR),  David Munton (Cape Town), Classic Bus magazine and LOTS.\n John Hinson \n keeps lists of RT survivors as well, which may vary in emphasis from this one.\nRT 196  HLW 183      restored, Switzerland \nRT 222               Cape Town, restored chassis, awaiting body from RTL 1264 \nRT 261  HLW 248 2008 preserved, K.Clements, Aylesford\nRT 274  HLX 91    \nRT 277  HLX 94  2008 chassis, R.Brown, Motcombe \nRT 542  HLX 359 2008 in rebuild, D.Wilkinson, Billericay \nRT 586  HLX 403 2008 caravan, T.Tyburn, Bristol  \nRT 604  HLX 421 2008 preserved, Purley Transport Preservation Group  \n RT604, last of the London Country passenger-carrying RTs, is happily a frequent rally attender.\nIt is also very active on Running Days, and is seen here between turns at Hertford in June 2002.\n It is shown here at North Weald 98 and Showbus 98.\n Photos by Ian Smith.
