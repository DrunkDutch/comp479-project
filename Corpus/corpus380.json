[1]  The show, which airs live each weekday at 08:00  ET , is broadcast on the internet and by over 1,400 radio and television stations worldwide. [2] \n The program combines news reporting, interviews, investigative journalism and political commentary with an eye toward documenting social movements, struggles for justice and the effects of  American foreign policy . While described as  progressive  by fans as well as critics, the show's executive producer rejects that label, calling the program a global newscast that has \"people speaking for themselves\". [1] \n Democracy Now Productions, the independent  nonprofit organization  which produces  Democracy Now!,  is funded entirely through contributions from listeners, viewers, and foundations and does not accept advertisers, corporate underwriting or government funding.

[4]  It originally aired on five  Pacifica Radio  stations. [1]  Goodman is the program's principal host, with Juan Gonzalez and  Nermeen Shaikh  as frequent co-hosts. [3]   Jeremy Scahill , an  investigative reporter  and co-founding editor for  The Intercept , [5]  has been a frequent contributor since 1997. [1] \n Democracy Now!  began broadcasting on television every weekday shortly after September 11, 2001, and is the only public media in the U.S. that airs simultaneously on satellite and cable television, radio, and the internet. [6] \n In June 2002,  Democracy Now!  separated from  Pacifica Radio  and became an independent nonprofit organization. \n On February 19, 2016, \"Democracy Now!\" marked 20 years on the air with an hourlong retrospective look back at \"two decades of independent, unembedded news,\" with highlights chosen from over 5,000 episodes. [7]  Amy Goodman also published a book entitled \"Democracy Now!: 20 Years Covering the Movements Changing America,\" [8]  and launched a 100-city tour across the United States to mark the 20th anniversary of Democracy Now!, with scheduled broadcasts of the show recorded during her travels. [9] \n Studios [ edit ] \n Democracy Now!  began as a radio program broadcast from the studios of  WBAI , a local  Pacifica Radio  station in  New York City . In early September 2001, amid a months-long debate over the mission and management of Pacifica,  Democracy Now!  was forced out of the WBAI studios. Goodman took the program to the  Downtown Community Television Center  located in a converted firehouse building in New York City's  Chinatown , where the program began to be televised. [10] [11]  Only a few days later on September 11, 2001  Democracy Now!  was the closest national broadcast to  Ground Zero . On that day Goodman and colleagues continued reporting beyond their scheduled hourlong time slot in what became an eight-hour marathon broadcast. Following  9/11 , in addition to radio and television,  Democracy Now!  expanded their multimedia reach to include  cable ,  satellite radio ,  Internet , and  podcasts . [10] \n In November 2009,  Democracy Now!  left their broadcast studio in the converted DCTV firehouse, where they had broadcast for eight years. [11]  The studio subsequently moved to a repurposed graphic arts building in the  Chelsea District  of  Manhattan . [11]  In 2010, the new 8500-square-foot [12]   Democracy Now!  studio became the first radio or television studio in the nation to receive  LEED Platinum  certification, [13] [14]  the highest rating awarded by the  U.S. Green Building Council . \n Syndication [ edit ] \n Democracy Now!  is the flagship program of the  Pacifica Radio  network. [15]  It also airs on several  NPR  member stations. The television simulcast airs on  public-access television  stations; by satellite on  Free Speech TV  and  Link TV , and  free-to-air  on  C Band . [16]   Democracy Now!  is also available on the  Internet  as downloadable and  streaming  audio and video. [17]  In total, nearly 1,400 television and radio stations broadcast  Democracy Now!  worldwide. [2] [18] \n Awards and reaction [ edit ] \n I think it's probably the most significant  progressive  news institution that has come around in some time. \n Robert W. McChesney , quoted in  The Nation [19] \n Democracy Now!  and its staff have received several journalism awards, including the  Gracie Award  from  American Women in Radio & Television ; [20]  the  George Polk Award  for its 1998 radio documentary  Drilling and Killing : Chevron and Nigeria's Oil Dictatorship , on the  Chevron Corporation  and the deaths of two  Nigerian  villagers protesting an oil spill; [21]  and Goodman with  Allan Nairn  won Robert F. Kennedy Memorial's First Prize in International Radio for their 1993 report,  Massacre: The Story of East Timor  which involved first-hand coverage of  genocide  during the  Indonesian occupation of East Timor . [22] \n On October 1, 2008,  Goodman was named  as a recipient of the 2008  Right Livelihood Award , [23]  in connection with her years of work establishing  Democracy Now!  and on 2009, she, like her frequent guest  Glenn Greenwald , was awarded the first annual Izzy Award (named after journalist  I. F. \"Izzy\" Stone ) for \"special achievement in independent media.\" [24]  Her co-host Juan Gonzalez was inducted into the New York chapter of the  Society of Professional Journalists ' Hall of Fame on November 19, 2015. [25] [26] \n 2008 Republican National Convention arrests [ edit ] \n Three journalists with  Democracy Now! \u2014including principal host  Amy Goodman , and news producers Nicole Salazar and  Sharif Abdel Kouddous \u2014were detained by police during their reporting on the  2008 Republican National Convention protests . [27]  Salazar was filming as officers in full  riot gear  charged her area. As she yelled \"Press!\" she was knocked down and told to put her face in the ground while another officer dragged her backward by her leg across the pavement. The video footage of the incident was immediately posted on the Internet, leading to a large public outcry against her arrest. When a second producer, Kouddous, approached, he too was arrested, and charged with a  felony . According to a press release by  Democracy Now! , Goodman herself was arrested after confronting officers regarding the arrest of her colleagues. The officers had established a line of \"crowd control,\" and ordered Goodman to move back. Goodman claims she was arrested after being pulled through the police line by an officer, and subsequently (as well as Kouddous) had her press credentials for the convention physically stripped from her by a  secret service  agent. [18] [28]  All were held on charges of \"probable cause for riot.\" [29]  A statement was later released by the city announcing that all \"misdemeanor charges for presence at an unlawful assembly for journalists\" would be dropped. The felony charges against Salazar and Kouddous were also dropped. [30] \n Goodman, Salazar, and Kouddous subsequently filed a lawsuit against the cities of  St. Paul and Minneapolis  as well as other defendants. [30]  According to Baher Asmy of the  Center for Constitutional Rights , \"[a]ll three plaintiffs that are journalists with  Democracy Now  reached a final settlement with the city of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the United States Secret Service, that will resolve the claims that they had against them from unlawful and quite violent arrests.\" The settlement includes $100,000 in compensation and a promise of police training. [18] [31] \n 2016 North Dakota access pipeline protests [ edit ] \n Further information:  Dakota Access Pipeline protests \n In September 2016, an arrest warrant for criminal trespass was issued for Amy Goodman after covering for  Democracy Now!  the  Dakota Access Pipeline protests  during which guards unleashed dogs and pepper spray on protesters in  Morton County, North Dakota . [32] [33] [34]  An arrest warrant was reportedly also issued for Green Party presidential candidate  Jill Stein  and her running mate,  Ajamu Baraka . [32] [33] [34] \n Goodman elected to turn herself in. Three days before the court date, the charges were increased to engaging in a riot, which carried a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $1,500 fine. [35]  On October 17, 2016, the judge quickly dismissed the charges, but Morton County prosecutors insisted the case is still open and that they may pursue further charges in the future. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  Goodman asserted the importance of freedom of the press and said that  Democracy Now!  would continue covering the developing situation in North Dakota. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] \n Notable guests, interviews, and on-air debates [ edit ] \n Guest(s) \n First Appearance(s) \n Episode or Guest Notoriety \n Mumia Abu-Jamal \n 000000001997-02-24-0000 February 24, 1997 \n In its first year,  Democracy Now!  was one of the first national programs to air radio commentaries from the controversial journalist and former  Black Panther Party  member, on death row in Pennsylvania for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer. The 1997 decision to air Abu-Jamal's commentaries caused  Democracy Now!  to lose twelve of its then 36 affiliates.

Finkelstein \n 000000002003-09-24-0000 September 24, 2003 \n Finkelstein is a frequent guest.
