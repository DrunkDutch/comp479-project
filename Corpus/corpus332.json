RTL is concerned about confidential information issues.\u00a0 The site\u2019s privacy policy informs you of RTL\u2019s practices with respect to the personal information you give when you use the address  http://www.rtl-longueuil.qc.ca  \n Scope of this policy \n This policy applies only to the RTL\u2019s website. It respects the requirements of the  Loi sur l'acc\u00e8s aux documents des organismes publics et sur la protection des renseignements personnels  (also called \u00ab Access Act \u00bb) and all other applicable laws. \n This site does not have a secured zone allowing separate and confidential exchanges between the user\u2019s computer and the RTL\u2019s computer system. Transmission of data through the Internet network cannot be completely secured. RTL\u2019s commitment on the protection of personal information rests only on the processing of information that is in its possession and the one obtained according to the provisions of the applicable laws.\u00a0 Only authorized members of our personnel will have access to this information, and only in the exercise of their functions. \n A user is not required to disclose any personal information to access the contents of the RTL\u2019s website.\u00a0 However, the RTL offers, through this website, certain services and special advantages requiring a user to provide personal information should he/she wish to benefit from them, such as the e-mail notification service \u201cComments\u201d or \u201cComplaints\u201d, or when a user wants to subscribe to a distribution list in order to receive information on the RTL and its transit network, or when the user wants to participate in a contest or a survey.\u00a0 Any omission or false declaration made by the user when providing the required information could lead to refusal to process the request.\u00a0 With respect to contests, names of the winners are broadcasted to users through different means of communication.\u00a0 However, when pictures or images are used, the winner(s) is (are) always contacted beforehand to sign an authorization form for advertising purposes.\u00a0 Note however that the recorded information in these sections is subject to the RTL\u2019s privacy policy. \n If you use a computer in a public place or shared with other users, be sure to erase all traces of browsing saved in the historic before login out. \n Links to other sites \n This site also suggests relevant links to other sites. When you click on one of those hyperlinks, a message informs you that you are now leaving the RTL\u2019s virtual space. The exchanged information is no longer subject to RTL\u2019s privacy policy pertaining to its site, but to the visited site\u2019s policy. \n Use of cookies \n RTL uses cookies to make it easier to browse through the site\u2019s pages. These cookies gather none of your personal information. You can, at any time, configure your browser to block cookies. However, doing so may prevent you from accessing certain functions offered on the site. \r\nFurthermore, information transmitted automatically between computers cannot identify you personally. It is gathered only for technological purposes related to Internet browsing. \n Automatic data exchanges \n When you access the site, your computer and the site\u2019s server automatically exchange information. This automatic communication is necessary for the server to send files that are compatible with the type of computer equipment you use. The exchanged information is as follows: \n name of the domain supplier that gives you access to Internet; \n your IP address (ex. 123.45.67.890), a unique number assigned to your computer when linked to Internet; \n the type of browser (ex. : Firefox, Explorer) and the operating system (ex. : Windows, Mac OS) that you use; \n the pages you visit; \n the date and time you access these pages; \n the address of the referring site when you access the site from another website. \n The RTL keeps this data in a log file for statistical purposes only. It assists in tabulating the number of visits, the pages most often visited, the technology used by the users, the referring sites and the visitors\u2019 country of origin.\u00a0 However, it is not possible to personally identify the user.\u00a0 The RTL is not trying to establish a user\u2019s personal identity, except if it detects an activity contrary to the site\u2019s terms of use. \n Information sent by e-mail \n Site users can contact the RTL by e-mail using the form found in sections \u201c Comments \u201d and \u201c Complaints \u201d or when they want to subscribe to a distribution list in order to receive information on the RTL and its transit network, or when they wish to participate in a contest or in a survey.\u00a0 Only authorized members of our personnel will have access to this information and only in the exercise of their functions. \n RTL\u2019s authorized personnel treat these e-mails with the same confidentiality rules as for regular mail. \r\nYour personal information (name, address and phone number) are used by the RTL and its authorized representatives strictly to process your request. \r\n\u00a0 \r\nThe RTL will not pass on this information to another organization unless your request is addressed to it and it is necessary in order to process your request. In this case, the RTL will keep this data for follow-up purposes. \n When you send us personal information, this information will not show in the reply you will receive by e-mail. When we must pass on confidential information, we use other means of communication than electronic mail to answer you. \r\n\u00a0 \r\nThis information will be stored securely and only our Customer Service will be able to access it. \r\nRectification access right \r\nWith respect to personal information created, gathered and kept by the RTL under the Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information (L.R.Q., c. A-2-1), any natural person has a right to access and, in certain cases, to rectify the personal information the RTL has on that person.\u00a0 This information is kept for a period of time in line with RTL\u2019s retention schedule in accordance with the Archives Act (L.R.Q., c. A-21.1). \r\nThe RTL does not sell, rent, exchange, loan nor dispose of any personnel information obtained through electronic means of communication, unless the sender of such information consents to it or that the RTL is required to do so under the law or following the decision of a competent court. \n For more information concerning this policy \n If you have questions regarding this policy, we invite you to contact us using one or the other means of communication suggested on the page  Contact us . \r\n\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \n  Services \n  Schedules and Maps \n  RTL Mobile \n  Express service \n  Shared Taxi \n  Students Zone \n  Universal accessibility \n  Network Map \n  FAQ \n  Fares \n  Fare schedule \n  Access to student rates \n  OPUS  Solo Flex card \n  Membership Offers \n  Transfer  \n  Points of Sale \n  Customer Service \n  Information \n  Road work \n  Comment \n  Complaint \n  Lost and Found \n  Bus Rental \n  RTL \n  Board of directors \n  Equipment \n  Sustainable Development \n  Standards & Regulations \n  Advertising on Buses \n  Press room \n  Press Releases \n  Public Notice \n  Documents and practical information \n  Public consultations \n  Media resources \n RTL \u00a9 2017 \n About Website  |  \n Legal Notice  |  \n Web Accessibility  |  \n Confidentiality  |  \n Site map  |  \n GTFS  |  \n Fran\u00e7ais"}
