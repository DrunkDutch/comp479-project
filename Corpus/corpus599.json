[ citation needed ]  Under the 2004 extension of the Agreement, the following minimum service levels are required: \n Inbound freight capacity: 7,800 lane metres per week. \n Service to north-west UK ports: 936 return sailings per year. \n Summer-period frequency to Liverpool: a daily service from April to the third week in October. \n Services to the east coast of Ireland: 63 return sailings per year. \n Compliance with the above requirements gains the sole user rights to the government-owned  linkspan  in Douglas Harbour. [ citation needed ]  The Steam Packet Company owns the second linkspan, and thus controls a monopoly on roll-on-roll-off vehicle transport to and from the Isle of Man. \n In 2006, the company was under investigation by a select committee of  Tynwald , the Isle of Man's parliament. One of the concerns of Tynwald is the annual published profit margins by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company which, according to Hansard, are 36% - almost three times the industry standard for ferry companies throughout the world. [ citation needed ] \n History [ edit ] \n Mona's Queen (IV)  in 1961 \n Beginning of the company [ edit ] \n There had been various shipping companies serving the  Isle of Man  before the formation of this company in 1830, but their crossings were irregular and vessels used were unreliable. As a result the island could be cut off for weeks at a time. \nIsle of Man Steam Packet Poster. \n The Manx people felt it was essential they should have their own dedicated service. A meeting was held in  Douglas  in 1829, from which was formed a committee charged investigating the cost of acquiring a  steam packet . \n On 30 June 1830, the forerunner of today's  Isle of Man Steam Packet Company  was born when the brand new vessel,  Mona's Isle , built at a cost of \u00a37,250, sailed from Douglas to  Liverpool  on its very first sailing. From the inauguration of the service until January 1832, the company was known as the  Mona's Isle Company . Briefly the company then traded as the  Isle of Man United Steam Packet , before assuming its present name in July 1832. \n By the turn of the 20th century, the company was serving numerous ports in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. [2]  Ports served included Liverpool,  Silloth ,  Whitehaven ,  Holyhead ,  Ardrossan ,  Blackpool ,  Belfast  and  Dublin . \n War service [ edit ] \n Vessels and crews of the company were actively involved in both the  First  and  Second World Wars . One vessel,  King Orry , was attached to the  British Grand Fleet  and led the  German High Seas Fleet  into  Scapa Flow  in the  Orkney Islands  at the end of the First World War. [3]  Another vessel,  Viking , was converted to become a  seaplane carrier , serving as  HMS\u00a0 Vindex . \n During the First World War, eleven out of a total fleet of fifteen Steam Packet ships were requisitioned by the  Admiralty . Four of them were lost, three retained by the government and four returned to service.  Ben-my-Chree  and  Manxman  also served as aircraft/seaplane carriers. [3] \n In the Second World War, ten of the fleet of sixteen ships were commandeered for active duty, four of which were lost. The  Dunkirk evacuation  was perhaps the company's finest hour, with  Mona's Isle (IV)  being the first to leave  Dover  and the first to complete the round trip during the evacuation. Eight company ships took part in this mission, rescuing a total of 24,699 British troops \u2013 one in fourteen of those evacuated from Dunkirk. However this was also saw the company's blackest day, as three of the line's ships were lost: \n Mona's Queen (III)  pictured shortly after she struck a mine on the approach to Dunkirk, 29 May 1940. \n Mona's Queen , mined off Dunkirk on 29 May; \n Fenella , sunk by air attack whilst berthed alongside the East Pier [ where? ]  on 29 May; \n King Orry , sustained heavy damage following several air attacks on 29 May, and sank off the beaches in the early hours of 30 May. [3] \n The anchor from  Mona's Queen  (III) was raised as part of the 70th anniversary commemoration of Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk. It is sited at Kallow Point in  Port St Mary  as a memorial to the company's crew who took part in the war. [4] \n Vehicle transport [ edit ] \n Four side-loading  RORO  car ferries were introduced, beginning with  Manx Maid  in 1962, and followed by  Ben-my-Chree  (1966),  Mona's Queen  (1972) and  Lady of Mann  (1976).  Mona's Isle (VI)  was the Steam Packet Company's first stern loader in 1984-85. \n The 1980s were tough times for the company, with declining passenger numbers. Strong  competition  from  Manx Line 's  Manx Viking  brought them close to collapse. In February 1985, they announced a merger with  Sealink  who had, by now, taken over  Manx Line . [5]  The main UK port switched from Liverpool to  Heysham , thus ending (albeit temporarily as it turned out) an association lasting back to the company's origins. \n 2008 rebranding [ edit ] \n Ben-my-Chree  entering Douglas Harbour \n In June 2007, a new  CEO , Mark Woodward, was appointed to succeed Hamish Ross; he promised to improve the company's services, to return to the classic livery, and to promote the island's culture. \n As the first part of the rebranding, the  Sea Express 1  and  SuperSeaCat Two  were renamed  Snaefell  and  Viking  respectively; the latter was later sold and operated for the Atlantico Line as  Hellenic Wind . \n The fleet received a brand new livery, replacing the old  SeaCo  livery. All vessels of the fleet underwent complete internal refits which reflected the company's new colours and the rebranding of the company's on board lounges. The terminals received new signage and new uniforms were made for crew and shore staff. \n The company's first class lounge and members club were renamed:  1st Lounge  became the  Premium Lounge  and the  Blue Riband Club  became the  Executive Club . The  Quiet Lounge  was also renamed, becoming the  Niarbyl  Reserved Lounge . \n Today [ edit ] \n In return for exclusive use of the linkspans at Douglas, the Steam Packet Company has guaranteed regular services to the Manx government.  Ben-my-Chree  and  Manannan  provide regular services to England and Ireland. \n In addition to the regular routes, the company operates a few special day excursions to other destinations or round the Isle of Man in summer. Extra sailings are scheduled at times of high demand such as the  TT  period. The company also operates its own in-house travel agency, Steam Packet Holidays. \n In August 2017 the company announced plans to scrap the Belfast route and switch sailings to the port of  Larne  in  Northern Ireland . The move would allow the sailings to carry freight, motorhomes and coaches which cannot currently be accommodated through Belfast. [6] \n Recent changes of ownership [ edit ] \n In 1996, the Steam Packet Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of  Sea Containers Ltd  headed by  James Sherwood , who had pioneered the fast-craft operation. \n In July 2003, the company was sold for \u00a3142 million to Montagu Private Equity (previously named  HSBC Private Equity Ltd ). \n In 2005, the company was purchased by  Macquarie Bank , a major Australian  investment bank , for \u00a3225 million. [7] \n In April 2011, it was announced that the company had new owners  Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo . [8] \n Fleet [ edit ] \n The company currently has two vessels: a year-round conventional RO-PAX vessel, and a fastcraft which operates seasonally. \n Picture \n Name \n Built \n Commissioned \n Routes \n Tonnage \n Port of Registry \n Notes \n MS  Ben-my-Chree  [VI] \n April 1998 \n July 1998 \n Douglas - Heysham \nDouglas - Birkenhead \nDouglas - Dublin \nDouglas - Belfast \n 12,747\u00a0 GT \n  Douglas \n Fleet flagship \n HSC  Manannan \n November 1998 \n May 2009 \n Douglas - Liverpool \nDouglas - Belfast \nDouglas - Dublin \n 5,743\u00a0 GT   [9] \n  Douglas \n Fastcraft \n Present day operations [ edit ] \n The Steam Packet Company operates services between: \n Douglas - Heysham (Year-round service) \n Douglas - Liverpool (Seasonal service - March to November) \n Douglas - Birkenhead (Seasonal service - November to March) \n Douglas - Belfast (Seasonal service - April to September) \n Douglas - Dublin (Seasonal service - April to September) \n Historic fleet [ edit ] \n See also list of ships below \n The company started with wooden paddle steamers, which soon gave way to the steel \"screw\" vessels. The \"screw\" vessels were superseded by turbine steamers, the first being the 1905  Viking . The company then replaced the passenger-only steamers with side-loading car ferries, the first diesel car ferry being the 1972  Mona's Queen  (V). Fastcraft then became the next generation of vessels to operate for the company, the first being the  SeaCat Isle of Man . \n Pre-war steamers [ edit ] \n The company built five steamers over ten years from 1927. They were the replacements for the various second-hand steamers that the company purchased to replace its First World War losses. \n Image \n Ship \n Built \n(Commissioned) \n Route \n Tonnage \n Notes \n Ben-my-Chree  [IV] \n April 1927 \n(June 1927) \n Douglas  \u2014 various \n 2,586\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Ghent in 1965 \n Lady of Mann  [I] \n April 1929 \n(June 1930) \n Douglas  \u2014 various \n 3,104\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Dalmuir in 1971 \n Mona's Queen  [III] \n April 1934 \n(? 1934) \n Douglas  \u2014 various \n 2,756\u00a0 GT \n Sunk at Dunkirk in 1940 \n Fenella \n December 1936 \n(? 1937) \n Douglas  \u2014 various \n 2,376\u00a0 GT \n Sunk at Dunkirk in 1940 \n Tynwald  [IV] \n December 1936 \n(? 1937) \n Douglas  \u2014 various \n 2,376\u00a0 GT \n Sunk off Bougie in 1942 \n The \"Six Sisters\" [ edit ] \n A class of vessel derived from pre-war steamers  Fenella  and  Tynwald  affectionately known as the  Six Sisters . These were all built by  Cammell Laird  in Birkenhead and were in service between 1946 and 1982. They operated from Douglas to various ports. No two vessels were identical and all had their own (albeit minor) differences. The last vessel to be withdrawn was  Manxman  in 1982. At the time it was the last vessel of its type in service in the British Isles. Despite preservation attempts the vessel was finally scrapped in 2012. \n Image \n Ship \n Built \n(Commissioned) \n Tonnage \n Notes \n King Orry  [IV] \n November 1945 \n(January 1946) \n 2,485\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Strood in 1979 \n Mona's Queen  [IV] \n February 1946 \n(June 1946) \n 2,485\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use as  Fiesta \nScrapped at Perama in 1981 \n Tynwald  [V] \n March 1947 \n(July 1947) \n 2,487\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Aviles in 1975 \n Snaefell  [V] \n March 1948 \n(July 1948) \n 2,489\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Blyth in 1978 \n Mona's Isle  [V] \n October 1950 \n(March 1951) \n 2,491\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped in the Netherlands in 1980 \n Manxman  [II] \n February 1955 \n(May 1955) \n 2,495\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Sunderland in 2012 \n Side-loading car ferries [ edit ] \n The company developed a design of side-loading car ferries, with a spiral ramp at the stern. These could operate (as car ferries) from ports which were not equipped with  linkspans . This design is still unique to the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company today. They operated from Douglas to various ports. \n Image \n Ship \n Built \n(Commissioned) \n Tonnage \n Notes \n Manx Maid  [II] \n January 1962 \n(May 1962) \n 2,724\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Garston in 1986 \n Ben-my-Chree  [V] \n December 1965 \n(May 1966) \n 2,762\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at Santander in 1989 \n Mona's Queen  [V] \n December 1971 \n(May 1972) \n 2,998\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use as  Mary the Queen \nScrapped at Alang in 2008 \n Lady of Mann  [II] \n December 1975 \n(June 1976) \n 3,083\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use as  Panagia Soumela \nScrapped at Aliaga in 2011 \n RO-RO ferries [ edit ] \n The company has operated a number of RO-RO passenger and freight ferries in its history, the pioneering vessel being the  Peveril  [IV] in 1981, in response to Manx Line's  Manx Viking . \n Image \n Ship \n Built \n(Commissioned) \n Route \n Tonnage \n Notes \n Mona's Isle  [VI] \n May 1966 \n(April 1985) \n Douglas  \u2014 Heysham \n 4,657\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use as  Al Fahad \nSunk off Jeddah in 2004 \n Tynwald  [VI] \n April 1967 \n(October 1985) \n 3,762\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use as  Lauro Express \nScrapped at Alang in 2007 \n King Orry  [VI] \n February 1972 \n(February 1990) \n Douglas \u2014 Heysham \n Douglas \u2014 Liverpool \n 4,649\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use as  Moby Love \nStill in service \n Peveril  [IV] \n January 1971 \n(May 1981) \n Douglas \u2014 various \n 1,975\u00a0 GT \n Sold for further use in 2000 \nBelieved scrapped \n Manx Viking \n August 1974 \n(1976) \n Douglas \u2014 Heysham \n 3,589\u00a0 GT \n Scrapped at  Sault Ste.

None of the 294 passengers and crew was hurt, and the ferry was moored at  Liverpool Pier Head  while water was being pumped from the engine room, a number of cars remained on board. She was later towed to the Cammell Laird basin in  Birkenhead  where all cars remaining aboard were offloaded. On 14 March 2007, the  Sea Express 1  was relaunched. In the meantime alternative service was provided by  Ben-my-Chree  to Birkenhead during the weekends. In December 2007, the vessel was renamed to become the sixth  Snaefell . \n 2010  Ben-my-Chree  accident [ edit ] \n On 26 March 2010, while embarking passengers and loading vehicles at Heysham, England, the ro-ro passenger ferry  Ben-My-Chree  moved approximately eight metres along the quayside, causing serious damage to the passenger access structure. The foot-passenger walkway detached at both ends and collapsed onto the quayside, and the gangway detached from the vessel\u2019s side shell door and was left hanging on a single rope. Fortunately, there were no injuries. Eight passengers were trapped in the gangway compartment of the shore structure and were later rescued by the local fire service. [10] \n Competition [ edit ] \n 2010 competition with Mezeron [ edit ] \n On 1 November 2010, it was reported on the  Isle of Man Newspapers  website, that the Steam Packet had lost two major freight customers to rival company Mezeron who had just set up a new freight service between Douglas and Liverpool a week or so earlier. In February 2011 Mezeron withdrew the service citing lack of growth in the market. Previously the Steam Packet Company had reported a loss of 15% of its total freight business to Mezeron. \n Ellan Vannin Line [ edit ] \n In early 2013  Sea Alliance  announced plans for a new shipping company to serve the  Isle of Man . [11]  The company planned to use a 32-year-old vessel  MV Cometa . [12]  However the venture failed and nothing has been heard since. \n Filmography [ edit ] \n Steam Packet ships have been used in a number of  films . Examples include  Chariots of Fire  where the team travel on a Steam Packet vessel with the  Liver Building  clearly visible. In the  Barbra Streisand  film,  Yentl  the ship carrying emigrants to the United States at the end of the film is the  Manxman . The  Ben-my-Chree  [6] was used in 2004 as a double for an  English Channel  ferry in the film  On a Clear Day . The  Lady of Mann  was also used in the 2004 film  Mickybo and Me . \n See also [ edit ] \n Ellan Vannin \n HMS\u00a0 Ben-my-Chree \n References [ edit ] \n Most of the contents of this article have come from the  company's own web site . \n Working the Sea , television documentary, BBC North West (2006) ( Working the Sea  feature - BBC Isle of Man website ) \n This article  relies too much on  references  to  primary sources .
