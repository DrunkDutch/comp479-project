The main floor\u2019s east side has aesthetic lines and windows that curve to create the image of an eye overlooking the centre\u2019s landscaped entrance. The eye is emblematic of PERFORM\u2019s clinical observations towards establishing better nutrition, improved rehabilitation methods, and healthier lifestyle choices for everyone. \n The north-facing side is constructed entirely of windows to maximize natural light and connect the building\u2019s interior with the outdoor landscape. The interior/exterior ambiance reflects the need for people to maintain a healthy balance with indoor and outdoor activities. Hallways are painted in warm yellow and orange tones for a sunny, welcoming effect. \n \u00a0 \n PERFORM\u2019s facilities include: \n Cardio Pulmonary Evaluation \u00a0suite equipped to measure pulmonary and cardiac function through exercise stress testing \n Clinical Analysis\u00a0 suite with labs to examine the behavioural or metabolic changes in the health of participants at the molecular level \n Nutrition\u00a0 suite consisting of a state-of-the-art metabolic kitchen and teaching/dining area staffed by experienced dieticians and nutritionists, and used in conjunction with the Clinical Analysis suite for metabolic and absorption studies \n Athletic Therapy (AT)\u00a0 teaching clinic delivering prompt, professional care to faculty, students and staff, as well as the general public, while also offering Exercise Science students an innovative internship experience \n Functional Assessment\u00a0 laboratories equipped to measure motion range, flexibility, strength, balance, muscle action potential, water retention and neural activity \n Research Imaging\u00a0 suite enabling researchers to examine different areas of the body to see whether injuries or conditions might be improved with rehabilitation therapy \n PERFORM also houses\u00a0 Le Centre , which offers Concordia students, faculty, staff and alumni, as well as the public, the opportunity to improve their fitness in a unique conditioning and rehabilitation facility. The open space encased in windows from the building\u2019s surrounding hallways reflects PERFORM\u2019s trilateral focus on research, education and community engagement. \n \u00a0 \n Leap , the public art embellishing PERFORM\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, was created by Montreal artist Adad Hannah. The large-scale, photo-based work on glass vibrantly depicts a series of 17 people engaged in various physical activities. Concordia students, faculty, and staff members served as models for the art to convey PERFORM\u2019s goal of healthier living for everyone starting with the university\u2019s community. \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
