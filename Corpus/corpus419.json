Both  free and open-source software  (FOSS) and open-source hardware are created by this  open-source culture  movement and apply a like concept to a variety of components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as  FOSH  (free and open-source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it \u2013 coupling it closely to the  maker movement . [1]  Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings,  schematics ,  bills of material ,  PCB  layout data,  HDL  source code [2]  and  integrated circuit  layout data), in addition to the software that  drives  the hardware, are all released under free/ libre  terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high  return on investment  for investors. [3] \n Since the rise of reconfigurable  programmable logic devices , sharing of logic designs has been a form of open-source hardware. Instead of the schematics,  hardware description language  (HDL) code is shared. HDL descriptions are commonly used to set up  system-on-a-chip  systems either in  field-programmable gate arrays  (FPGA) or directly in  application-specific integrated circuit  (ASIC) designs. HDL modules, when distributed, are called  semiconductor intellectual property cores , or  IP cores . \n Contents \n 1   History \n 2   Forms of open-source hardware \n 2.1   Computers \n 2.2   Electronics \n 2.3   Mecha(tro)nics \n 2.4   Others \n 3   Licenses \n 4   Development \n 5   Open-source labs \n 6   Business models \n 7   Reception and impact \n 8   Find open-source hardware products \n 9   See also \n 10   References \n 11   External links \n History [ edit ] \nopenhardware.org logo (2013) \nOSHWA logo \n The first hardware focused \" open source \" activities were started around 1997 by  Bruce Perens , creator of the  Open Source Definition , co-founder of the  Open Source Initiative , and a  ham radio operator . He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program, which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open. [4] [5] \n Shortly after the launch of the Open Hardware Certification Program, David Freeman announced the Open Hardware Specification Project (OHSpec), another attempt at licensing hardware components whose interfaces are available publicly and of creating an entirely new computing platform as an alternative to proprietary computing systems. [6]  In early 1999, Sepehr Kiani, Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open-source philosophy to machine design applications. Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an  Open Design  Definition. But most of these activities faded out after a few years. \n By the mid 2000s open-source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open-source hardware projects and companies, such as  OpenCores ,  RepRap  ( 3D printing ),  Arduino ,  Adafruit  and  SparkFun . In 2007, Perens reactivated the openhardware.org website. \n Following the  Open Graphics Project , an effort to design, implement, and manufacture a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference graphics card, Timothy Miller suggested the creation of an organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community. Thus, Patrick McNamara founded the  Open Hardware Foundation  (OHF) in 2007. [7] \n The  Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation  (TAPR), founded in 1982 as a non-profit organization of amateur radio operators with the goals of supporting R&D efforts in the area of amateur digital communications, created in 2007 the first open hardware license, the  TAPR Open Hardware License . The  OSI  president  Eric S. Raymond  expressed some concerns about certain aspects of the OHL and decided to not review the license. [8] \n Around 2010 in context of the  Freedom Defined  project, the Open Hardware Definition was created as collaborative work of many [9]  and is accepted as of 2016 by dozens of organizations and companies. [10] \n In July 2011, CERN ( European Organization for Nuclear Research ) released an open-source hardware license,  CERN OHL . Javier Serrano, an engineer at CERN\u2019s Beams Department and the founder of the Open Hardware Repository, explained: \u201cBy sharing designs openly, CERN expects to improve the quality of designs through peer review and to guarantee their users \u2013 including commercial companies \u2013 the freedom to study, modify and manufacture them, leading to better hardware and less duplication of efforts\u201d. [11]  While initially drafted to address CERN-specific concerns, such as tracing the impact of the organization\u2019s research, in its current form it can be used by anyone developing open-source hardware. [12] \n Following the 2011 Open Hardware Summit, and after heated debates on licenses and what constitutes open-source hardware, Bruce Perens abandoned the OSHW Definition and the concerted efforts of those involved with it. [13]  Openhardware.org, led by Bruce Perens, promotes and identifies practices that meet all the combined requirements of the Open Source Hardware Definition, the Open Source Definition, and the Four Freedoms of the  Free Software Foundation [14]  Since 2014 openhardware.org is not online and seems to have ceased activity. [15] \n The  Open Source Hardware Association  (OSHWA) at oshwa.org proposes  Open source hardware  and acts as hub of open source hardware activity of all genres, while cooperating with other entities such as TAPR, CERN, and OSI. The OSHWA was established as an organization in June 2012 in Delaware and filed for tax exemption status in July 2013. [16]  After same debates about trademark interferences with the OSI, in 2012 the OSHWA and the OSI signed a co-existence agreement. [17] [18] \n In 2012, after years of skepticism on the relevance of  free hardware designs , [19]  the  Free Software Foundation  started the \" Respects Your Freedom \" (RYF) computer hardware product certification program. It was intended to encourage the creation and sale of hardware that respects users' freedom and privacy, and aims to ensure that users have control over their devices. [20] [21]  RYF certified laptops faced criticism on the basis of being slow and outdated hardware. [22] [23] \n FSF's  Replicant  project suggested in 2016 an alternative \"free hardware\" definition, derived from the  FSF's four freedoms . [24] \n Forms of open-source hardware [ edit ] \n The term  hardware  in open source hardware has been historically used in opposition to the term  software  of open source software. That is, to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs (see previous section). However, as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source (for example  Wikihouse ,  OpenBeam  or  Hovalin ), this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of \"physical product.\" Indeed, the field of open source hardware has been shown to go beyond electronic hardware and to cover a larger range of product categories such as machine tools, vehicles and medical equipment [25] . In that sense,  hardware  refers to any form of tangible product, may it be electronic hardware, mechanical hardware, textile or even construction hardware. The Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0 defines hardware as \"tangible artifacts \u2014 machines, devices, or other physical things.\" [26] \n Computers [ edit ] \n Due to a mixture of privacy, security, and environmental concerns, a number of projects have started that aim to deliver a variety of open-source computing devices. Examples include the  EOMA68  ( SBC  in a  PCMCIA  form-factor, intended to be plugged into a laptop or desktop chassis),  Novena  (bare motherboard with optional laptop chassis), and  GnuBee  (series of Network Attached Storage devices). \n Several  retrocomputing  hobby groups have created numerous recreations or adaptations of the early  home computers  of the 1970s and 80s, some of which include improved functionality and more modern components (such as  surface-moun t ICs and  SD card  readers). [27] [28] [29]  Some hobbyists have also developed add-on cards (such as drive controllers [30] , memory expansion [31] , and sound cards [32] ) to improve the functionality of older computers. Miniaturised recreations of vintage computers have also been created. [33] \n Electronics [ edit ] \n One of the most popular types of open-source hardware is electronics. There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as  Sparkfun ,  Adafruit  and Seeed. In addition, there are  NPOs  and companies that provide a specific open-source electronic component such as the  Arduino  electronics prototyping platform. There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor [34] [35]  and a robotics-assisted  mass spectrometry  assay platform. [36] [37]  Open-source electronics finds various uses, including automation of chemical procedures. [38] [39] \n Mecha(tro)nics [ edit ] \n A large range of products including mechanical components have been developed so far, from machine tools to vehicles over musical instruments and medical equipment. [25]  Examples of machine-tools are the 3D printers  RepRap  and  Ultimaker  as well as the laser cutter  Lasersaur . In the category vehicles, we can find bikes like  XYZ Space Frame Vehicles  and cars like the  Tabby OSVehicle . Examples of medical equipment are the echostethoscope  echOpen  and a wide range of prosthetic hands listed in the review study by Ten Kate  et.al. [40]  e.g. the  OpenBionics\u2019 Prosthetic Hands . \n Others [ edit ] \n Examples of open-source hardware products can also be found to a lesser extent in construction ( Wikihouse ) and textile ( Kit Z\u00e9ro Kilom\u00e8tres ). \n Licenses [ edit ] \n Rather than creating a new license, some open-source hardware projects simply use existing,  free and open-source software  licenses. [41]  These licenses may not accord well with  patent law . [42] \n Later, several new licenses have been proposed, designed to address issues specific to hardware designs. [43]  In these licenses, many of the fundamental principles expressed in open-source software (OSS) licenses have been \"ported\" to their counterpart hardware projects. New  hardware licenses  are often explained as the \"hardware equivalent\" of a well-known OSS license, such as the  GPL ,  LGPL , or  BSD license . \n Despite superficial similarities to  software licenses , most hardware licenses are fundamentally different: by nature, they typically rely more heavily on  patent  law than on  copyright  law, as many hardware designs are not copyrightable. [44]  Whereas a copyright license may control the distribution of the source code or design documents, a patent license may control the use and manufacturing of the physical device built from the design documents. This distinction is explicitly mentioned in the preamble of the  TAPR Open Hardware License : \n \"... those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property.\" \n \u2014\u2009 TAPR Open Hardware License [45] \n Noteworthy licenses include: \n The  TAPR Open Hardware License : drafted by attorney  John Ackermann , reviewed by OSS community leaders  Bruce Perens  and  Eric S. Raymond , and discussed by hundreds of volunteers in an open community discussion [46] [8] \n Balloon Open Hardware License : used by all projects in the  Balloon Project \n Although originally a software license,  OpenCores  encourages the  LGPL \n Hardware Design Public License: written by  Graham Seaman , admin. of Opencollector.org \n In March 2011  CERN  released the  CERN Open Hardware License  (OHL) [47]  intended for use with the Open Hardware Repository [48]  and other projects. \n The Solderpad License [49]  is a version of the  Apache License  version 2.0, amended by lawyer Andrew Katz to render it more appropriate for hardware use. \n The  Open Source Hardware Association  recommends seven licenses which follow their  open-source hardware definition . [50]  From the general copyleft licenses the  GNU General Public License  (GPL) and  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike  license, from the HW specific copyleft licenses the  CERN Open Hardware License  (OHL) and  TAPR Open Hardware License  (OHL) and from the  permissive licenses  the  FreeBSD license , the  MIT license , and the  Creative Commons Attribution  license. [51]  Openhardware.org recommended in 2012 the TAPR Open Hardware License, Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 and GPL 3.0 license. [52] \n Organizations tend to rally around a shared license. For example,  Opencores  prefers the  LGPL  or a  Modified BSD License , [53]   FreeCores  insists on the  GPL , [54]   Open Hardware Foundation  promotes \" copyleft \" or other permissive licenses\", [55]  the  Open Graphics Project  us [56] es a variety of licenses, including the  MIT license ,  GPL , and a proprietary license, [57]  and the  Balloon Project  wrote their own license. [58] \n Development [ edit ] \nThe OSHW (Open Source Hardware) logo  silkscreened  on an unpopulated  PCB \n The adjective \"open-source\" not only refers to a specific set of freedoms applying to a product, but also generally presupposes that the product is the object or the result of a \"process that relies on the contributions of geographically dispersed developers via the Internet.\" [59]  In practice however, in both fields of open-source hardware and open-source software, products may either be the result of a development process performed by a closed team in a private setting or by a community in a public environment, the first case being more frequent than the second which is more challenging [25] . Establishing a community-based product development process faces several challenges such as: to find appropriate product data management tools, document not only the product but also the development process itself, accepting losing ubiquitous control over the project, ensure continuity in a context of fickle participation of voluntary project members, among others. [60] \nThe  Arduino  Diecimila, another popular and early open source hardware design. \n One of the major differences between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs, which cost money to prototype and manufacture. As a result, the phrase \"free as in speech, not as in beer\", [61]  more formally known as  Gratis versus Libre , distinguishes between the idea of zero cost and the freedom to use and modify information. While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for individual project developers, some community members have proposed models to address these needs [62]  Given this, there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms, such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank. \n Extensive discussion has taken place on ways to make open-source hardware as accessible as  open-source software . Providing clear and detailed product documentation is an essential factor facilitating product replication and collaboration in hardware development projects. Practical guides have been developed to help practitioners to do so. [63] [64]  Another option is to design products so they are easy to replicate, as exemplified in the concept of  open-source appropriate technology . [65] \n The process of developing open-source hardware in a community-based setting is alternatively called  open design , open source development [66]  or  open source product development [67] . All these terms are instantiations of the  open-source model  applicable for the development of any product, may it be software, hardware, cultural, educational, and so on. See  here  for a delineation of these terms. \n A major contributor to the production of open-source hardware product designs is the scientific community. There has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and  3-D printing . [68] [69] [70]  Other sources of open-source hardware production are vendors of chips and other electronic components sponsoring contests with the provision that the participants and winners must share their designs.  Circuit Cellar  magazine organizes some of these contests. \n Open-source labs [ edit ] \n A guide has been published ( Open-Source Lab (book)  by  Joshua Pearce ) on using  open-source electronics  and  3D printing  to make  open-source labs . Today scientists are creating many such labs, examples include: \n Boston Open Source Science Laboratory , Somerville, Massachusetts \n BYU Open Source Lab ,  Brigham Young University \n Michigan Tech [71] \n National Tsing Hua University [72] \n OSU Open Source Lab ,  Oregon State University \n Open Source Research Lab ,  University of Texas  at El Paso \n Business models [ edit ] \n Open hardware companies are experimenting with different business models. [73]  In one example,  littleBits  implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module, in accordance with the  CERN Open Hardware License Version  1.2. [74]  In another example,  Arduino  has registered its name as a  trademark . Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the Arduino name on them. Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation. [75]  There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms. For example, to accelerate development and technical innovation the  photovoltaic  industry has experimented with partnerships, franchises, secondary supplier and completely open-source models. [76] \n Recently, many open source hardware projects were funded via  crowdfunding  on  Indiegogo  or  Kickstarter . Especially popular is  Crowd Supply  for crowdfunding open hardware projects. [77] \n Reception and impact [ edit ] \nCover for \" Open-Source Lab \" by Joshua M. Pearce (2014). \n Richard Stallman , the founder of the  Free Software  movement, was in 1999 skeptical on the idea and relevance of  Free hardware  (his terminology what is now known as open-source hardware). [78]  In a 2015  Wired  article he adapted his point of view slightly; while he still sees no ethical parallel between free software and free hardware, he acknowledges the importance. [79]  Also, Stallman uses and suggest the term  free hardware design  over  open source hardware , a request which is consistent with his earlier rejection of the term  open source software  (see also  Alternative terms for free software ). [79] \n Other authors, such as  Joshua Pearce  have argued there is an ethical imperative for open-source hardware \u2013 specifically with respect  open-source appropriate technology  for  sustainable development . [80]  In 2014, he also wrote the book  Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs , which details the development of  free and open-source hardware  primarily for  scientists  and university  faculty . [81] [82] \n Find open-source hardware products [ edit ] \n Some ongoing initiatives provide indexes of open-source hardware products for different purposes: \n The  Open Source Hardware Association  provides a certification programme and maintains a  directory of certified products . \n The  Observatory of Open Source Hardware  aims at supporting exchange of best practices between practitioners. It maintains an open access and curated  directory of open source hardware products  rated according to their degree of openness. This directory contains references of more than 200 complex open source hardware products. \n The P2P Foundation maintains an  Open Hardware Directory  as well. \n See also some specific lists in Wikipedia:\n List of open-source hardware projects \n Open-source computing hardware \n Open-source car \n See also [ edit ] \n Free software portal \n Open innovation \n Open Source Ecology \n Open-source robotics \n Rapid prototyping \n fab lab \n Computer numeric control \n Open manufacturing \n Reuse \n HardwareX \n Hardware backdoor \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Alicia Gibb (Ed.)
