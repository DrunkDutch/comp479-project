(October 2016)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n Lean startup  is a  methodology  for developing businesses and products, which aims to shorten product  development cycles  by adopting a combination of business- hypothesis -driven experimentation,  iterative  product releases, and  validated learning . The central hypothesis of the lean startup methodology is that if  startup companies  invest their time into iteratively building products or services to meet the needs of early customers, they can reduce the market risks and sidestep the need for large amounts of initial project funding and expensive product launches and failures.

[3] [4] [5]  The methodology has since been expanded to apply to any individual, team, or company looking to introduce new products or services into the market. [6]  The lean startup's reputation is due in part to the success of Ries'  bestselling  book,  The Lean Startup , published in September 2011. [7] [8] [9] [10]   Amazon.com  listed the book as one of their Best Business Books of 2011, [11]  and by June 2012 the book had sold 90,000 copies. [12] \n Ries' said that his first company, Catalyst Recruiting, failed because he and his colleagues did not understand the wants of their target customers, and because they focused too much time and energy on the initial product launch. [4] [13]  Next, Ries was a senior software engineer with There, Inc., [4] [13]  which Ries described as a classic example of a Silicon Valley startup with five years of stealth  R&D , $40 million in financing, and nearly 200 employees at the time of product launch. [13]  In 2003, There, Inc. launched its product,  There.com , but they were unable to garner popularity beyond the initial  early adopters . [13]  Ries claims that despite the many proximate causes for failure, the most important mistake was that the company's \"vision was almost too concrete\", making it impossible to see that their product did not accurately represent consumer demand. [13] \n Although the lost money differed by orders of magnitude, Ries concluded that the failures of There, Inc. and Catalyst Recruiting shared similar origins: \"it was working forward from the technology instead of working backward from the business results you're trying to achieve.\" [6] \n Precursors [ edit ] \n The lean startup methodology is based on  lean manufacturing , the streamlined production process pioneered by  Taiichi Ohno  by combining flow principles used by  Henry Ford  starting in 1906 and the  TWI  programs introduced to Japan in 1951. After more than 15 years of experiments, he had a stable and reproducible system. Use of the term  lean  to describe Ohno's system was first formalized in the 1990 book  The Machine That Changed the World . [14] \n The lean manufacturing system considers as waste the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer, and continually seeks ways to eliminate such waste. In particular, the system focuses on minimizing inventory throughout the assembly line.  Kanban cards  are used to signal only when the necessary inputs to production are needed, and in so doing, reduce assembly waste (inventory) and increase productivity. [15]  Additionally, immediate quality control checkpoints can identify mistakes or imperfections during assembly as early as possible to ensure that the least amount of time is expended developing a faulty product. [16]  Another primary focus of the lean management system is to maintain close connections with suppliers in order to understand their customers' desires. \n In an article published in the  Harvard Business Review  in 2013, Ries' mentor  Steve Blank  described how the lean startup methodology also draws its inspiration from the work of people like Ian C. MacMillan and  Rita Gunther McGrath  who developed a technique called  discovery-driven planning , which was an attempt to bring an entrepreneurial mindset to planning. [17] \n Overview [ edit ] \n Similar to the precepts of lean manufacturing, the lean startup methodology seeks to eliminate wasteful practices and increase value-producing practices during the product development phase so that startups can have a better chance of success without requiring large amounts of outside funding, elaborate business plans, or the perfect product. [5]  Customer feedback during product development is integral to the lean startup process, and ensures that the producer does not invest time designing features or services that consumers do not want. [18]  This is done primarily through two processes, using key  performance indicators  and a continuous deployment process. [2] [19] [20] \n Because startups typically cannot afford to have their entire investment depend upon the success of one single product launch, the lean startup methodology proposes that by releasing a  minimum viable product  that is not yet finalized, the company can then make use of customer feedback to help further tailor their product to the specific needs of its customers. [2] [5] \n The lean startup methodology asserts that the \"lean has nothing to do with how much money a company raises\"; rather it has everything to do with assessing the specific demands of consumers and how to meet that demand using the least amount of resources possible. [4] \n Definitions [ edit ] \n Definitions based on  The Lean Startup [ edit ] \n In his blog and book, Ries uses specific terms to refer to the core lean startup principles. \n Minimum viable product [ edit ] \n A  minimum viable product  (MVP) is the \"version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort\" (similar to a  pilot experiment ). [7] [21]  The goal of an MVP is to test fundamental business hypotheses (or leap-of-faith assumptions) and to help entrepreneurs begin the learning process as quickly as possible. [7]  As an example, Ries notes that  Zappos  founder  Nick Swinmurn  wanted to test the hypothesis that customers were ready and willing to buy shoes online. [7]  Instead of building a website and a large database of footwear, Swinmurn approached local shoe stores, took pictures of their inventory, posted the pictures online, bought the shoes from the stores at full price after he'd made a sale, and then shipped them directly to customers. [7]  Swinmurn deduced that customer demand was present, and Zappos would eventually grow into a billion dollar business based on the model of selling shoes online. [7] \n Continuous deployment (only for software development) [ edit ] \n Continuous deployment, similar to  continuous delivery , is a process \"whereby all code that is written for an application is immediately deployed into production,\" which results in a reduction of  cycle times . [22]  Ries states that some of the companies he's worked with deploy new code into production as often as 50 times a day. [22]  The phrase was coined by Timothy Fitz, one of Ries's colleagues and an early engineer at  IMVU . [7] [23] \n Split testing [ edit ] \n A split or  A/B test  is an experiment in which \"different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time.\" [7]  The goal of a split test is to observe differences in behavior between the two groups and to measure the impact of each version on an actionable metric. \n A/B testing is sometimes incorrectly performed in serial fashion, where a group of users one week may see one version of the product while the next week users see another. This undermines the statistical validity of the results, since external events may influence user behavior in one time period but not the other. For example, a split test of two ice cream flavors performed in serial during the summer and winter would see a marked decrease in demand during the winter where that decrease is mostly related to the weather and not to the flavor offer. \n Another way to incorrectly A/B test is to assign users to one or another A/B version of the product using any non-random method. \n Actionable metrics [ edit ] \n Actionable metrics can lead to informed business decisions and subsequent action. [7] [24]  These are in contrast to vanity metrics\u2014measurements that give \"the rosiest picture possible\" but do not accurately reflect the key drivers of a business. \n Vanity metrics for one company may be actionable metrics for another. For example, a company specializing in creating web based dashboards for financial markets might view the number of web  page views [20]  per person as a vanity metric as their revenue is not based on number of page views. However, an online magazine with advertising would view web page views as a key metric as page views are directly correlated to revenue. \n A typical example of a vanity metric is \"the number of new users gained per day\". While a high number of users gained per day seems beneficial to any company, if the cost of acquiring each user through expensive advertising campaigns is significantly higher than the revenue gained per user, then gaining more users could quickly lead to bankruptcy. \n Pivot [ edit ] \n A pivot is a \"structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth.\" [7]  A notable example of a company employing the pivot is  Groupon ; when the company first started, it was an online activism platform called The Point. [1]  After receiving almost no traction, the founders opened a  WordPress  blog and launched their first coupon promotion for a pizzeria located in their building lobby. [1]  Although they only received 20 redemptions, the founders realized that their idea was significant, and had successfully empowered people to coordinate group action. [1]  Three years later, Groupon would grow into a billion dollar business. \n Steve Blank  defines a pivot as \"changing (or even firing) the plan instead of the executive (the sales exec, marketing or even the CEO).\" [25] [26] \n Innovation accounting [ edit ] \n This topic focuses on how entrepreneurs can maintain accountability and maximize outcomes by measuring progress, planning milestones, and prioritizing. [27] \n Build-Measure-Learn [ edit ] \n The Build\u2013Measure\u2013Learn loop emphasizes speed as a critical ingredient to product development. A team or company's effectiveness is determined by its ability to ideate, quickly build a  minimum viable product  of that idea, measure its effectiveness in the market, and learn from that experiment. In other words, it's a  learning cycle  of turning ideas into products, measuring customers' reactions and behaviors against built products, and then deciding whether to persevere or pivot the idea; this process repeats as many times as necessary. The phases of the loop are: Ideas \u2192  Build  \u2192 Product \u2192  Measure  \u2192 Data \u2192  Learn . [28] \n This rapid iteration allows teams to discover a feasible path towards  product/market fit , and to continue optimizing and refining the business model after reaching product/market fit. [28] [29] \n Definitions popularized after  The Lean Startup [ edit ] \n Business Model Canvas [ edit ] \n Main article:  Business Model Canvas \n The  Business Model Canvas  is a strategic management template invented by  Alexander Osterwalder  and  Yves Pigneur  for developing new business models or documenting existing ones. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's  value proposition , infrastructure, customers, and finances. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs. [30] \n Lean Canvas [ edit ] \n The Lean Canvas is a version of the  Business Model Canvas  adapted by Ash Maurya specifically for startups. [28]  The Lean Canvas focuses on addressing broad customer problems and solutions and delivering them to customer segments through a unique value proposition. [31] \n The movement [ edit ] \n Ries and others created an annual technology conference called Startup Lessons Learned which has subsequently changed its name to the Lean Startup Conference. [32]  Lean startup meetups in cities around the world have garnered 20,000 regular participants. [6]  The first lean startup meetup named Lean Startup Circle was created by Rich Collins on June 26, 2009 [33]  hosting speaking events, workshops, and roundtable discussions. As of 2012, there are lean startup meetups in over 100 cities and 17 countries as well as an online discussion forum with over 5500 members. [34]  Third-party organizers have led lean startup meetups in  San Francisco ,  Chicago ,  Boston ,  Austin ,  Beijing ,  Dublin , and  Rio de Janeiro , among others\u2014many of which are personally attended by Ries\u2014with the  Chicago  and  New York City  Lean Startup Meetups attracting over 4,000 members each. [35]  The Lean Startup Machine created a new spin on the lean startup meetups by having attendees start a new company in three days. [36]  As of 2012, the Lean Startup Machine claimed to have created over 600 new startups this way. [37] \n Several prominent high-tech companies have begun to publicly employ the lean startup methodology, including  Intuit ,  Dropbox ,  Wealthfront ,  Votizen ,  Aardvark , and  Grockit . [38] [18] [39]  The lean startup principles are also taught in classes at  Harvard Business School  and  UC Berkeley  and are implemented in municipal governments through  Code for America . [12] \n In addition, the  United States Government  has recently begun to employ lean startup ideas. The  Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States ,  Steven VanRoekel  noted that he is taking a \"lean-startup approach to government.\" [40]  Ries has also worked with the former and current  Chief Technology Officers of the United States \u2014 Aneesh Chopra  and  Todd Park  respectively\u2014to implement aspects of the lean startup model into the  United States Government . [41] [42]  In particular, Park noted that in order to understand customer demand, the  Department of Health and Human Services , recognized \"the need to rapidly prototype solutions, engage customers in those solutions as soon as possible, and then quickly and repeatedly iterate those solutions based on working with customers.\" [43] [44]  In May 2012, Ries and  The White House  announced the  Presidential Innovation Fellows  program, which brings together top citizen innovators and government officials to work on high-level projects and deliver measurable results in six months. [45] \n Lean concepts [ edit ] \n Lean startup principles have been applied to specific competencies within typical startups and larger organizations: [17] \n Lean  analytics \n Lean  brand management \n Lean hardware \n Lean events \n Lean manufacturing \n Lean  marketing \n Lean  product management \n Lean  sales \n Lean software development \n Lean  UX \n Criticism [ edit ] \n Ben Horowitz , the co-founder of venture capital firm  Andreessen Horowitz , wrote an article in 2010 criticizing the lean startup method for over-emphasizing \"running lean\" (constantly cutting and reducing non-essential parts of the company to save time and money). He specifically disagreed with portraying \"running lean\" as an end rather than a means to winning the market without running out of cash. Horowitz gave as an example his startup  Loudcloud , which by \"running fat\" was able to outperform 20 direct competitors and after 8 years reach a value of $1.6 billion. [46]  However, at least since 2008, numerous advocates of lean methods have pointed out that \"running lean\" does not mean cost cutting. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] \n Trey Griffith, the VP of technology at Teleborder, stated in 2012 that the majority of backing for the lean startup methodology was anecdotal and had not been rigorously validated when first presented. However, he goes on to note that better support of the method comes out of a 2011 analysis of the factors of success in growth companies as described in the 2011 book  Great by Choice . [55] \n John Finneran, a business writer and former user of the lean startup method, described in 2013 a number of the method's assumptions that he did not recognize during his use of the method. In particular, he observed that his clients were often not motivated to invest time and effort into helping iterate a minimal viable product; instead they wanted a more polished product to begin with. Second, he found virtually no early adopters who were willing to try to give feedback on unpolished software simply to be the first to get a chance at it. Third, he argued that lean startup can distract from essential traditional management practices like development discipline and budget protection. In general, he stated that it is important to be critical and skeptical of lean startup methods rather than pre-supposing that they will be effective. [56]  Ries had already anticipated this criticism in his book when he wrote, on page 279: \"We cannot afford to have our success breed a new pseudoscience around pivots, MVPs, and the like. This was the fate of scientific management, and in the end, I believe, that set back its cause by decades.\" [7]  This implies that the concept of  validated learning  applies to the lean startup methods themselves, and not just to products.

OCLC \u00a0 726074707 .  Lean thinkers see cost as the end result of all our systems and processes. As an end result, cost is not something that can be directly impacted. Or at least we do not have an impact on it in the traditional \"cost-cutting\" ways, which typically have meant layoffs and possibly the scaling back of services provided to our community. Lean hospitals focus on reducing waste, not cutting costs. Lean organizations also focus on the customers (the patients) and the value that is being delivered to them. In this way, Lean is not focused on doing less but rather on delivering the right amount of value. If we are reducing waste, we can often provide more value while expending less effort and less cost. \u00a0 \n ^   Sarkar, Debashis (2012).

Organizations often view Lean as purely a cost-cutting tool. This is a parochial view from individuals or organizations that do not entirely comprehend what Lean thinking is and what it can do to a business. Lean is not a cost-cutting tool but a method that drives cost-efficiency. \u00a0 \n ^   Grady, Kenneth (25 February 2015).  \"Lean is not about cost cutting\" .  seytlines.com .

Lean is a philosophy through which we look at value from the client's perspective and focus what we do on delivering that value while respecting people. \u00a0 \n ^   Markovitz, Daniel (30 March 2015).  \"For the last time: cost cutting isn't 'lean ' \" .  markovitzconsulting.com . Retrieved  4 June  2015 .  There's plenty of research proving that cost reduction isn't sustained in the long run. Just like weight always comes back after drastic dieting, costs always creep back two to three years after drastic cuts, because the underlying processes and capabilities haven't been improved. \u00a0 \n ^   Paterson, James C.

One of the things that particularly drew me to the Lean Startup methodology is that it is a metaprocess from which more specific processes and practices can be formulated. The same principles used to test your product can and should be applied to test your tactics when taking these principles to practice. There is no room for faith in a Lean Startup.... There are no silver bullets. No methodology can guarantee success. But a good methodology can provide a feedback loop for continuous improvement and learning. \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lean_startup&oldid=803167819 \"\t\t\t\t\t \n Categories :  Entrepreneurship Lean manufacturing Hidden categories:  Articles lacking reliable references from October 2016 All articles lacking reliable references   \n Navigation menu \n Personal tools \n Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in   \n Namespaces \n Article Talk   \n Variants \n Views \n Read Edit View history   \n More \n Search \n Navigation \n Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store   \n Interaction \n Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page   \n Tools \n What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item Cite this page   \n Print/export \n Create a book Download as PDF Printable version   \n Languages \n Eesti Espa\u00f1ol \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc Fran\u00e7ais \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 Italiano \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e Portugu\u00eas \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u4e2d\u6587   \n Edit links   \n  This page was last edited on 30 September 2017, at 22:01. \n Text is available under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.
