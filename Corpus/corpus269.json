This year\u2019s results  show that the requirements have generally led to improved disclosure by issuers  and are having a positive impact on the representation of women on boards,\u201d  said Louis Morisset, CSA Chair and President and CEO of the Autorit\u00e9 des  march\u00e9s financiers. \u201cThis topic continues to be a CSA priority and we will  continue to evaluate and report thereon to ensure meaningful disclosure is  provided.\u201d \u00a0 \nOur review found that in the case of the 215 issuers with a market  capitalization over $1 billion, 18 per cent of board seats are now held by  women, compared with 16 per cent last year, and in the case of the 42 largest  issuers with a market capitalization over $10 billion, these numbers are 23 per  cent and 21 per cent, respectively. Among the issuer sample, 55 per cent have  at least one woman on their boards (an increase of six per cent over last  year), and 66 issuers (or 10 per cent) have three or more women on their  boards, compared to 56 issuers (or eight per cent) last year. The percentage of  issuers that have at least one woman in an executive officer position remained  relatively stable, and the total percentage of board seats occupied by women  has increased from 11 per cent to 12 per cent.  \nThe review also found that issuers that have a policy relating to the  representation of women on their boards have average female board  representation of 18 per cent compared to issuers with no policy, which have  average female board representation of 10 per cent. Similarly, issuers with  board targets have an average of 25 per cent female board representation compared  to issuers without targets that average 10 per cent female representation. \nLater this fall, the participating jurisdictions will publish the underlying  data for this review on their websites.  \nOnce all issuers have made corporate governance disclosure regarding women on  boards and in executive officer positions for two consecutive years, the  participating jurisdictions intend to publish a comparison of the complete  two-year results. \nThe Staff notice can be found on the websites of the participating jurisdictions. \nThe CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada\u2019s provinces and  territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital  markets. \n - 30 - \n For more information: \n            Sylvain Th\u00e9berge \n            Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers \n            514-940-2176\n Kristen\n            Rose \n            Ontario Securities Commission \n            416-593-2336 \n Jason (Jay) Booth \n            Manitoba Securities Commission \n            204-945-1660 \n Andrew\n            Nicholson \n            Financial and Consumer Services \n            Commission, New Brunswick \n            506-658-3021\n Jane H.
