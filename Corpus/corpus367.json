[1]  Since that time, other  computing technology   firms  have  adopted the phrase  \"key server\" to be used interchangeably with \"software license server.\" [2] [3] \n It is the job of a software license server to determine and control the number of copies of a program permitted to be used based on the  license entitlements  that an organization owns. Typically, an  end-user  customer organization will install a software license server on a  host computer  to provide licensing services to an enterprise computing environment. \n Publisher-specific license servers are commonly provided by  software publishers , or through  third party providers , to manage software licensing for a specific software publisher's products. Publisher-specific license servers are more commonly used for industry specialized software products than for common software products due to the high value of the managed software products. [4] \n The server component of a client\u2013server application may also contain an internal license server. [5] [6] \n References [ edit ] \n ^   \"Company History\" . Sassafras Software Inc .
