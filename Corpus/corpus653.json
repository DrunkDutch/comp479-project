His selection is mostly due to the influence of his uncle, Lord Wilcot a powerful local figure. His opponent is to be Stella Stoker, a  fishmonger 's daughter with a degree from the  London School of Economics  who has been chosen to stand for the  Labour Party . \n Travelling up on the train to Earndale, the two candidates meet and while she quickly works out who he is, he remains ignorant of her true identity. To try to show off he begins to tell her about his selection for the seat and how he expects to win. He describes his opponent as a  bluestocking . He also inadvertently reveals embarrassing details to her such as the fact that he has scarcely been to Earndale in his life and that his family once controlled the seat as a  rotten borough . Once they arrive at Earndale station, he is soon made aware of his mistake. The electoral agents of both candidates are furious to discover they have been fraternising on the train. \n Wilcot goes to visit his uncle, and finds him to be an eccentric who has turned his  country house  into a money-making operation for visiting coach parties of tourists. It appears that he has engineered Robert Wilcot's selection as a candidate in order to spark public interest in the election, boosting his own business. It is also clear that the political contest is added to by the enmity of the two electoral agents the Tory Harding-Pratt and Labour's Bert Glimmer. \n Once on the  stump  the two candidates keep running into each other around Earndale, at one point during a factory visit leading to a  shouting match . Both begin to become entranced by the other, and become convinced they are falling in love. This comes to a head during the  hustings  at Wilcot Hall where they are caught embracing in the  maze  by their respective agents. Burying the hatchet, the two agents try to foil the potential romance. Despite repeated attempts to break up the candidates they continue a covert relationship. \n Cast [ edit ] \n Main cast [ edit ] \n Ian Carmichael  - Robert Wilcot \n Patricia Bredin  - Stella Stoker \n Richard Wattis  - Harding-Pratt \n Eric Barker  - Bert Glimmer \n Alastair Sim  - Lord Wilcot \n Moyra Fraser  - Annabel \n Jack Hedley  - Bill Hemmingway \n Gordon Harker  - Hardy \n William Kendall  - Pottle \n Anthony Sharp  - Peterson \n George Benson  - Egerton \n Leslie Dwyer  - Alf Stoker \n Moultrie Kelsall  - Grimsby Armfield \n Jeremy Hawk  - TV interviewer \n Russell Waters  - Mr. Bray \n Olwen Brookes  - Mrs. Samson \n John Salew  - Mayor \n Bill Shine  - Basingstoke \n Erik Chitty  - Deputy returning officer \n Redmond Phillips  - Mr. Smithson \n Irene Handl  - Mrs. Maggs \n John Sharp  - Mr. Reeves \n Supporting cast [ edit ] \n Douglas Ives - Plumber \n Olaf Pooley  - TV newscaster \n Hattie Jacques  - Woman in car \n Frederick Leister  - Himself \n Frank Atkinson  - Railway Porter \n Eamonn Andrews  - Himself \n Gilbert Harding  - Himself \n Carole Carr - Herself \n Josephine Douglas  - Herself \n Cameo/Uncredited cast [ edit ] \n Fred Griffiths  - Billingsgate Porter \n Victor Harrington - Man at Wilcot Priory \n Philip Latham  - Reporter \n Jim O'Brady - Billingsgate Porter \n References [ edit ] \n ^   http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Left-Right-and-Centre \n ^   http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/39961 \n External links [ edit ] \n Left Right and Centre  on  IMDb \n NY Times Film Review \n v \n t \n e \n Films of  Frank Launder  and  Sidney Gilliat \n Gilliat only \n Writer only \n Red Pearls  (1930) \n Lord Richard in the Pantry  (1930) \n Bed and Breakfast  (1930) \n You'd Be Surprised!
