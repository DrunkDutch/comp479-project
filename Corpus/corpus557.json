[5]  With its surrounding areas, it is the fifth-largest  metropolitan area  in the UK, with over 2.24 million people in 2011. [6]  The  local authority  is  Liverpool City Council , the most populous local government district within the  metropolitan county  of  Merseyside  and the largest within the  Liverpool City Region . \n Liverpool is located on the eastern side of the  Mersey Estuary , and historically lay within the ancient  hundred  of  West Derby  in the south west of the  county  of  Lancashire . [7] [8]  It became a  borough  in 1207 and a  city  in 1880. In 1889, it became a  county borough  independent of Lancashire. Its growth as a major  port  was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the  Industrial Revolution . Along with handling general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the city merchants were involved in the  Atlantic slave trade . In the 19th century, it was a major port of departure for Irish and English emigrants to the United States. Liverpool was home to both the  Cunard  and  White Star Line , and was the port of registry of the ocean liner  RMS  Titanic , the  RMS  Lusitania ,  Queen Mary  and  Olympic . \n The popularity of  The Beatles  and other groups from the  Merseybeat  era contributes to Liverpool's status as a tourist destination. Liverpool is also the home of two  Premier League   football  clubs,  Liverpool  and  Everton , matches between the two being known as the  Merseyside derby . Liverpool is the sole British club to win five  European Cups . The world-famous  Grand National  horse race takes place annually at  Aintree Racecourse  on the outskirts of the city. \n The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007. In 2008 it was nominated as the annual  European Capital of Culture  together with  Stavanger , Norway. [9]  Several areas of the city centre were granted  World Heritage Site  status by  UNESCO  in 2004. The  Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City  includes the  Pier Head ,  Albert Dock , and  William Brown Street . [10]  Liverpool's status as a port city has attracted a diverse population, which, historically, was drawn from a wide range of peoples, cultures, and religions, particularly from Ireland and Wales. The city is also home to the oldest  Black African community  in the country and the oldest  Chinese community  in Europe. \n Natives of the city of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians, and colloquially as \"Scousers\", a reference to \" scouse \", a form of stew. The word \"Scouse\" has also become synonymous with the  Liverpool accent and dialect . Another term for denizens of the city is Liverpolitan, although Liverpolitan may also be used for residents of the wider  Liverpool City Region . \n Contents \n 1   Origins of the name \n 2   History \n 2.1   Early history \n 2.2   19th century \n 2.3   20th century \n 2.4   21st century \n 2.5   Inventions and innovations \n 3   Government \n 3.1   Mayor and local council \n 3.2   Liverpool City Region Combined Authority \n 3.3   Parliamentary constituencies and MPs \n 4   Geography \n 4.1   Climate \n 4.2   Green Liverpool \n 5   Demography \n 5.1   Population \n 5.1.1   The city \n 5.1.2   Urban and metropolitan area \n 5.2   Ethnicity \n 5.3   Religion \n 5.4   Demonymy and identity \n 6   Economy \n 7   Landmarks \n 7.1   Waterfront and docks \n 7.2   Commercial district and cultural quarter \n 7.3   Other notable landmarks \n 7.4   Parks and gardens \n 8   Transport \n 8.1   National and international travel \n 8.1.1   Road links \n 8.1.2   Rail links \n 8.1.3   Port \n 8.1.4   Airport \n 8.2   Local travel \n 8.2.1   Trains \n 8.2.2   Buses \n 8.2.3   Mersey Ferry \n 8.3   Cycling \n 9   Culture \n 9.1   Music \n 9.2   Visual arts \n 9.3   Literature \n 9.4   Performing arts \n 9.5   Nightlife \n 10   Education \n 11   Sport \n 11.1   Football \n 11.2   Boxing \n 11.3   Horse racing \n 11.4   Golf \n 11.5   Greyhound Racing \n 11.6   Other sports \n 11.7   Sports stadiums \n 12   Media \n 13   Notable people \n 14   Quotes about Liverpool \n 15   International links \n 15.1   Twin cities \n 15.2   Friendship links \n 15.3   Consulates \n 16   See also \n 17   Notes \n 18   References \n 18.1   Footnotes \n 18.2   Bibliography \n 19   Further reading \n 20   External links \n Origins of the name \n The name comes from the Old English  liver , meaning thick or muddy, and  pol , meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as  Liuerpul . [11] [12]  According to the  Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names , \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\". [12]  The adjective  Liverpudlian  is first recorded in 1833. [12] \n Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of  eels  in the  Mersey . [13]  The name appeared in 1190 as \"Liuerpul\", [14]  and the place appearing as  Leyrpole , in a legal record of 1418, may refer to Liverpool. [15] \n History \n Main articles:  History of Liverpool  and  Timeline of Liverpool \n Liverpool in 1680 , the earliest known image of Liverpool. \nA map of Liverpool's original seven streets (north to the left). \n Early history \n King John 's  letters patent  of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool. [16]  By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 500. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a  royal charter , making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in an H shape: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street). \n In the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the  English Civil War , including an eighteen-day siege in 1644. In 1699 Liverpool was made a parish by  Act of Parliament , that same year its first  slave ship ,  Liverpool Merchant , set sail for Africa. [17]  Since Roman times, the nearby city of  Chester  on the  River Dee  had been the region's principal port on the  Irish Sea . However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring  River Mersey . \n As trade from the  West Indies , including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the  River Dee  continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial  wet dock  was built in Liverpool in 1715. [18] [19]  Substantial profits from the  slave trade  and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including  William Rathbone ,  William Roscoe  and  Edward Rushton , were at the forefront of the abolitionist movement. \n 19th century \n By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and  Manchester  became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the  Liverpool and Manchester Railway . The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when  Irish  migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the  Great Famine . \n Wikisource  has original text related to this article:\n 'Liverpool', \na poem by L. E. L. \n In her poem  Liverpool  (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce,  Letitia Elizabeth Landon  refers specifically to the  Macgregor Laird  expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress. \n Great Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place of both cotton and slavery in the city's economy, during the  American Civil War  Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\" [20] \nInaugural journey of the  Liverpool and Manchester Railway  in 1830, the first ever commercial railway line. \n For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London, [21]  and Liverpool's  Custom House  was the single largest contributor to the  British Exchequer . [22]  Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own  Whitehall  office. [23] \n In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the  Antarctic   sealing  industry, in recognition of which  Liverpool Beach  in the  South Shetland Islands  is named after the city. [24] \n Lime Street, Liverpool , in the 1890s,  St.George's Hall  to the left,  Great North Western Hotel  to the right,  Walker Art Gallery  and  Sessions House  in the background. Statues of  Prince Albert ,  Disraeli ,  Queen Victoria  and  Wellington's Column  in the middle ground. \n As early as 1851 the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\". [25]  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was attracting  immigrants  from across Europe. This resulted in construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The  Deutsche Kirche Liverpool ,  Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas ,  Gustav Adolf Church  and  Princes Road Synagogue  were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches,  St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church , served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. \n 20th century \n The postwar period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to integrate veterans into the economy. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including  police strikes in London  among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the UK, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in  Cardiff ,  Newport  and  Barry , and there had been incidents in  Glasgow ,  South Shields ,  London ,  Hull  and  Salford . [26]  Similarly, racial riots of whites against blacks took place across the United States in numerous industrial cities, [26]  so that a black leader termed the period of time  Red Summer . In that first postwar year, there were also riots in Caribbean and South African cities. [26] \nLiverpool was the port of registry of the ill-fated ocean liner  Titanic . The ship sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912, with the loss of 1,517 lives (including numerous Liverpudlians). A  Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic  is located on the city's waterfront. \n The  Housing Act 1919  resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families were relocated from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though this is largely subjective. Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the  Great Depression  of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. \n Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both  Hitler  and  Churchill . The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a  blitz  second only to London's. [27]  The pivotal  Battle of the Atlantic  was planned, fought and won from Liverpool. [28] \n The  Luftwaffe  made 80\u00a0 air-raids on Merseyside , killing 2,500\u00a0people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the  Seaforth Dock , the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction of the city centre has been deeply unpopular. It was as flawed as much subsequent town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with  Cologne , Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. \n Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of  Commonwealth  immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. A significant  West Indian  black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as  Toxteth , where housing was less expensive. \n The construction of suburban public housing expanded after the Second World War. Some of the older inner city areas were redeveloped for new homes. \n In the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the \" Merseybeat \" sound, which became synonymous with  The Beatles  and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also strongly affected American music for years and were internationally popular. The  Beatles  became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed for years together; they were the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder singer and composer  John Lennon  was killed in New York City in 1980, after the Beatles stopped performing together. Liverpool airport was renamed for him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honor of an individual. [29] [30] \n Previously part of  Lancashire , and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool in 1974 became a  metropolitan borough  within the newly created  metropolitan county  of  Merseyside . \n From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional  manufacturing industries  declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of  containerisation  meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK, [31]  standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously. [32] \n In the later 19th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. Since the mid-1990s the city has enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. \n Mathew Street  is one of many tourist attractions related to The Beatles, and the location of Europe's largest annual free  music festival . \n At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today. \n 21st century \n To celebrate the  Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II  in 2002, the conservation charity  Plantlife  organised a competition to choose  county flowers ; the  sea-holly  was Liverpool's final choice. \n Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as  The Beatles , as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. \n In 2004, property developer  Grosvenor  started the  Paradise Project , a \u00a3920\u00a0m development based on Paradise Street. This produced the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 'Liverpool ONE,' the centre opened in May 2008. \n In 2007, the city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool, for which a number of events were planned. Liverpool was designated as a joint  European Capital of Culture  for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 2008, included erection of  La Princesse , a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, and represents the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture.  La Princesse  roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the  Queensway Tunnel . \n Spearheaded by the multi-billion- pound  Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued through to the start of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects include new buildings in the  Commercial District , the  King's Dock ,  Mann Island , the  Lime Street Gateway , the  Baltic Triangle , the  RopeWalks , and the  Edge Lane Gateway . All projects could be eclipsed by the  Liverpool Waters  scheme, which if built will cost in the region of \u00a35.5billion and be one of the largest  megaprojects  in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from such groups as  UNESCO , which claimed that it would adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status. \n In June 2014, Prime Minister  David Cameron  launched the  International Festival for Business  in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014, [33]  and the largest in the UK since the  Festival of Britain  in 1951. [34] \n Inventions and innovations \nThe  Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine  and its modern extension. The first such school in the world \n Liverpool has been a center of industrial and later innovation.  Railways , transatlantic steamships, municipal trams, [35]  electric trains [36]  were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836 the first  railway tunnels  in the world were constructed under Liverpool. From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger  helicopter  service ran between Liverpool and  Cardiff . [37] \n The first  School for the Blind , [38]   Mechanics' Institute , [39]  High School for Girls, [40] [41]  council house [42]  and Juvenile Court [43]  were all founded in Liverpool. The  RSPCA , [44]   NSPCC , [45]   Age Concern , [46]   Relate ,  Citizen's Advice Bureau [47]  and  Legal Aid  all evolved from work in the city. \n In the field of public health, the first  lifeboat station , public baths and wash-houses, [48]  sanitary act, [49]   medical officer for health ,  district nurse ,  slum clearance , [50]  purpose-built ambulance, [51]  X-ray medical diagnosis, [52]   school of tropical medicine , motorised municipal fire-engine, [53]  free school milk and school meals, [54]  cancer research centre, [55]  and  zoonosis  research centre [56]  all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to  Ronald Ross , professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world. [57]   Orthopaedic surgery  was pioneered in Liverpool by  Hugh Owen Thomas , [58]  and modern medical anaesthetics by  Thomas Cecil Gray . \n The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by  James Newlands , appointedin 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer. [59] [60] \n In finance, Liverpool founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association [61]  and the first  Institute of Accountants . The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s. [62] \n In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first  lending library ,  athenaeum society ,  arts centre [63]  and  public art conservation centre . [64]  Liverpool is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra, the  Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra , [65]  as well as the oldest surviving repertory theatre, the  Liverpool Playhouse . [66] \n Oriel Chambers , the first 'modern' building in the world \n In 1864,  Peter Ellis  built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building,  Oriel Chambers , the prototype of the  skyscraper . The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey; [67]  it was the largest store in the world at the time. [68] \n Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual  Grand Olympic Festival . Devised by  John Hulley  and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook. [69] [70]  The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. [71]  In 1865 Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the  British Olympic Association . Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the  International Olympic Charter . \n Shipowner Sir  Alfred Lewis Jones  introduced the  banana  to Great Britain in 1884. [72] \n The  Mersey Railway , opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary [73]  and the world's first  deep-level underground stations . \n In 1889, borough engineer  John Alexander Brodie  invented the football  goal -net. He also was a pioneer in the use of  pre-fabricated  housing. Brodie oversaw the construction of the UK's first  ring road , the UK's first  intercity highway , as well as the  Queensway Tunnel  linking Liverpool and  Birkenhead . Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world, a title it held for 24 years. \n In 1897, the  Lumi\u00e8re  brothers filmed Liverpool, [74]  including what is believed to be the world's first  tracking shot , [75]  taken from the  Liverpool Overhead Railway , the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use  electric multiple units , the first to employ automatic signalling, and the first to install an escalator. \n Liverpool inventor  Frank Hornby  was a visionary in toy development and manufacture; he produced three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century:  Meccano ,  Hornby Model Railways  and  Dinky Toys . \n The  British Interplanetary Society , founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its  journal  is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world. [76] \n In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside the capital to be awarded  blue plaques  by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life.\" [77] \n Government \n Liverpool has several tiers of government; the Mayor and Local Council, who are also stakeholders in the  Liverpool City Region Combined Authority , the National Government and the European Parliament. \n Liverpool is officially governed by a  Unitary Authority , as when  Merseyside County Council  was disbanded civic functions were returned to a district borough level. However several services such as the  Police  and  Fire and Rescue Service , continue to be run at a county-wide level. \n Mayor and local council \n See also:  Liverpool City Council \nThe late Georgian  Liverpool Town Hall \nA number of Liverpool City Council services are based in the  Municipal Buildings \n The City of Liverpool is governed by the  Directly elected mayor of Liverpool  and  Liverpool City Council , and is one of six metropolitan boroughs that combine to make up the  Liverpool City Region . The Mayor is elected by the citizens of Liverpool every four years and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the council. The council's 90 elected  councillors  who represent local communities throughout the city, are responsible for scrutinising the Mayor's decisions, setting the Budget, and policy framework of the city. The Mayor's responsibility is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic priorities. [78]  The Mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government ministers and the Prime minister through his seat at the 'Cabinet of Mayors'. Discussions include pressing decision makers in the government on local issues as well as building relationships with the other  Directly elected mayors in England and Wales . [79]  The mayor is  Joe Anderson . \n The city of Liverpool effectively has two Mayors. As well as the directly elected Mayor, there is the ceremonial 'Lord Mayor' (or civic Mayor) who is elected by the full city council at its annual general meeting in May, and stands for one year in office. The Lord Mayor acts as the 'first citizen' of Liverpool and is responsible for promoting the city, supporting local charities and community groups as well as representing the city at civic events. [80]  The  Lord Mayor  is Councillor Frank Prendergast. [81] \n For local elections the city is split into 30 local council wards, [82]  which in alphabetical order are: \n Allerton and Hunts Cross \n Anfield \n Belle Vale \n Central \n Childwall \n Church \n Clubmoor \n County \n Cressington \n Croxteth \n Everton \n Fazakerley \n Greenbank \n Kensington and Fairfield \n Kirkdale \n Knotty Ash \n Mossley Hill \n Norris Green \n Old Swan \n Picton \n Princes Park \n Riverside \n Speke-Garston \n St Michaels \n Tuebrook and Stoneycroft \n Warbreck \n Wavertree \n West Derby \n Woolton \n Yew Tree \n During the most recent local elections,  held in May 2011 , the  Labour Party  consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from regaining power for the first time in 12 years, during the  previous elections in May 2010 . [83]  The Labour Party gained 11 seats during the election, taking their total to 62 seats, compared with the 22 held by the  Liberal Democrats . Of the remaining seats the  Liberal Party  won three and  the Green Party  claimed two. The  Conservative Party , one of the three major political parties in the UK had no representation on Liverpool City Council. [83] [84] \n In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was revealed to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a \u00a320m shortfall on Capital of Culture funding. [85] \n While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th Century was a municipal stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the  monetarist  economic policies of prime minister  Margaret Thatcher  after her  1979 general election  victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years. [86]  Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the  Winter of Discontent  (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied. [87] \n Liverpool City Region Combined Authority \n This article needs to be  updated .  Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.   (February 2017) \n The City of Liverpool is one of the six constituent local government districts of the  Liverpool City Region . Since 1 April 2014, some of the city's responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the  Liverpool City Region Combined Authority . \n The  combined authority  has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and The Mayor of Liverpool, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. \n As of July 2015, negotiations are currently taking place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region. Discussions include whether to introduce an elected \u2018Metro Mayor' to oversee the entire metropolitan area. [88] \n Parliamentary constituencies and MPs \n See also:  List of Parliamentary constituencies on Merseyside \n Liverpool has four  parliamentary constituencies  entirely within the city, through which members of parliament (MPs) are elected to represent the city in  Westminster :  Liverpool Riverside ,  Liverpool Walton ,  Liverpool Wavertree  and  Liverpool West Derby . [89]  At the  last general election , all were won by Labour with representation being from  Louise Ellman ,  Steve Rotheram ,  Luciana Berger  and  Stephen Twigg  respectively. Due to  boundary changes  prior to the 2010 election, the  Liverpool Garston  constituency was merged with most of  Knowsley South  to form the  Garston and Halewood  cross-boundary seat. At the most recent election this seat was won by  Maria Eagle  of the Labour Party. [90] \n Geography \n Satellite imagery  showing  Liverpool Bay , Liverpool and the wider  Merseyside  area \n Liverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\" [91]  At  53\u00b024\u20320\u2033N   2\u00b059\u20320\u2033W \ufeff / \ufeff 53.40000\u00b0N 2.98333\u00b0W \ufeff /  53.40000; -2.98333  (53.4, \u22122.98), 176 miles (283\u00a0km) northwest of London, located on the  Liverpool Bay  of the  Irish Sea  the city of Liverpool is built across a ridge of  sandstone  hills rising up to a height of around 230\u00a0feet (70\u00a0m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the  West Lancashire Coastal Plain . \n The  Mersey Estuary  separates Liverpool from the  Wirral Peninsula . The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to  Bootle ,  Crosby  and  Maghull  in south  Sefton  to the north, and  Kirkby ,  Huyton ,  Prescot  and  Halewood  in  Knowsley  to the east. \n Climate \n Liverpool experiences a  temperate   maritime climate , like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers and cool winters. More recently, the Met Office has operated a weather station at Crosby. Although Liverpool has a mild climate for its northerly latitude, it is far cooler than the  London  area during summer days, both as a result of being farther north and due to being exposed to maritime air from its west. The highest temperature recorded at the Bidston Observatory was 34.5\u00a0\u00b0C (94.1\u00a0\u00b0F) [92] [93] , recorded on  3 August 1990 , whilst the highest temperature recorded at Crosby was 34.3\u00a0\u00b0C (93.7\u00a0\u00b0F) [94] [95] , recorded on  19 July 2006 . For the period of 1971-2000, the warmest day of the year should reach an average of 27.6\u00a0\u00b0C (81.7\u00a0\u00b0F) [96] . \n The coldest temperature recorded at the Bidston Observatory was \u221212.8\u00a0\u00b0C (9.0\u00a0\u00b0F) [97] , recorded in January 1881, whilst the lowest recorded temperature at Crosby was \u221217.6\u00a0\u00b0C (0.3\u00a0\u00b0F) [98] , recorded on  21 December 2010 . On average, Crosby records 32.8 days of air frost, and for the period of 1971-2000, the coldest temperature of the year should fall down to \u22124.0\u00a0\u00b0C (24.8\u00a0\u00b0F) [99]  at the Bidston Observatory. \n Climate data for Crosby, elevation: 9\u00a0m or 30\u00a0ft (1981\u20132010) \n Month \n Jan \n Feb \n Mar \n Apr \n May \n Jun \n Jul \n Aug \n Sep \n Oct \n Nov \n Dec \n Year \n Average high \u00b0C (\u00b0F) \n 7.2 \n(45) \n 7.3 \n(45.1) \n 9.4 \n(48.9) \n 12.2 \n(54) \n 15.6 \n(60.1) \n 17.9 \n(64.2) \n 19.7 \n(67.5) \n 19.4 \n(66.9) \n 17.3 \n(63.1) \n 13.9 \n(57) \n 10.2 \n(50.4) \n 7.5 \n(45.5) \n 13.2 \n(55.8) \n Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F) \n 4.8 \n(40.6) \n 4.7 \n(40.5) \n 6.6 \n(43.9) \n 8.7 \n(47.7) \n 11.8 \n(53.2) \n 14.5 \n(58.1) \n 16.5 \n(61.7) \n 16.3 \n(61.3) \n 14.2 \n(57.6) \n 11.1 \n(52) \n 7.7 \n(45.9) \n 5.0 \n(41) \n 10.1 \n(50.2) \n Average low \u00b0C (\u00b0F) \n 2.4 \n(36.3) \n 2.1 \n(35.8) \n 3.8 \n(38.8) \n 5.1 \n(41.2) \n 7.9 \n(46.2) \n 11.1 \n(52) \n 13.3 \n(55.9) \n 13.2 \n(55.8) \n 11.0 \n(51.8) \n 8.2 \n(46.8) \n 5.2 \n(41.4) \n 2.5 \n(36.5) \n 7.2 \n(45) \n Average  precipitation  mm (inches) \n 74.9 \n(2.949) \n 54.4 \n(2.142) \n 63.6 \n(2.504) \n 54.3 \n(2.138) \n 54.9 \n(2.161) \n 66.2 \n(2.606) \n 59.0 \n(2.323) \n 68.9 \n(2.713) \n 71.7 \n(2.823) \n 97.3 \n(3.831) \n 82.6 \n(3.252) \n 88.8 \n(3.496) \n 836.6 \n(32.937) \n Average precipitation days  (\u2265 1.0 mm) \n 13.8 \n 10.7 \n 12.5 \n 10.4 \n 10.6 \n 10.5 \n 10.1 \n 11.2 \n 11.5 \n 14.8 \n 14.6 \n 13.9 \n 144.3 \n Source:  Met Office [100] \n Green Liverpool \n In 2010 Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust Commissioned  The Mersey Forest  to complete A Green Infrastructure Strategy for the City. [101] \n Demography \n Main article:  Demography of Liverpool \nPopulation of Liverpool City Council area, 1801\u20132011 [102] [103] \n Population \n The city \n At the  2011 UK Census  the recorded population of Liverpool was 466,415, a 6.1% increase on the figure of 439,473 recorded in the 2001 census. [103]  The population of the central Liverpool local authority peaked in the 1930s with 846,101 recorded in the 1931 census, before suburbanisation and the establishment of  new towns  in the region. [102]  As with many British cities including  London  and  Manchester , the city centre covered by the Liverpool council area had experienced negative population growth since the 1931 census. Much of the population loss was as a result of large-scale resettlement programmes to nearby areas introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, with towns such as  Kirkby ,  Skelmersdale  and  Runcorn  seeing a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s). [104] \n Liverpool's population is younger than that of England as a whole, with 42.3 per cent of its population under the age of 30, compared to an English average of 37.4 per cent. [105] [ not in citation given ]  As of July 2014 [update] , 66 per cent of the population was of working age. [105] \n Urban and metropolitan area \n Liverpool is the largest local authority by populace, GDP and area in Merseyside. Liverpool and is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Liverpool is defined as a standalone  NUTS3 area by the ONS for statistical purpose , and makes up part of the  NUTS2 area \"Merseyside\"  along with East Merseyside (Knowsley, St Helens and Halton), Sefton and the Wirral. The population of this area was 1,513,306 based on 2014 estimates. \n The \" Liverpool Urban Area \" is a term used by the  Office for National Statistics  (ONS) to denote the  urban area  around the city to the east of the  River Mersey . The contiguous built-up area extends beyond the area administered by  Liverpool City Council  into adjoining local authority areas, particularly parts of  Sefton  and  Knowsley . As defined by ONS, the area extends as far east as  Haydock  and  St. Helens . Unlike the Metropolitan area, the Urban Area does not include The Wirral or its contiguous areas. [106]  The population of this area as of 2011 was 864,211. \n The \" Liverpool City Region \" is an economic partnership between local authorities in Merseyside under the umbrella of the  Liverpool City Region Combined Authority  as defined by the Mersey Partnership. The area covers Merseyside and the  Borough of Halton  and has an estimated population between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 and. [107] \n In 2006 ESPON (now ( European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion ) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" as a functional urban area consisting of contiguous urban areas, labour pool, and commuter \"Travel To Work Areas\". The analysis grouped the  Merseyside  metropolitan county with the borough of  Halton ,  Wigan  in Greater Manchester, the city of  Chester  as well as number of towns in Lancashire and Cheshire including  Ormskirk  and  Warrington , estimating the polynuclear metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people. [108] \n Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area, [109] [110] [111]  or  megalopolis . [112] \n Ethnicity \nChinatown Gate  Chinatown, Liverpool \n According to data from the 2011 census, 84.8 per cent of Liverpool's population was  White British , 1.4 per cent  White Irish , 2.6 per cent White Other, 4.1 per cent  Asian or Asian British  (including 1.1 per cent British Indian and 1.7 per cent British Chinese), 2.6 per cent  Black or Black British  (including 1.8 per cent Black African) and 2.5 per cent  mixed-race . 1.8 per cent of respondents were from other ethnic groups. [3] \n Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest  Black  community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Black Liverpudlians can trace their ancestors in the city back ten generations. [113]  Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men. [114]  Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large  African-Caribbean , [115]   Ghanaian , [116]  and  Somali [117]  communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. \n The city is home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's  Chinatown  arrived as seamen in the 19th century. [118]  The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest gateway outside of China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community.  Lita Roza , a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry. \n The city is also known for its large Irish population and its historically large  Welsh  population. [119]  In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\" [119]  Following the start of the  Great Irish Famine  in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States. [120]  By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish. [121]  At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the  Republic of Ireland , while 0.54 per cent were born in  Northern Ireland , [122]  but many more Liverpudlians are of Welsh or Irish ancestry. \n Other contemporary ethnicities include  Indian , [115]   Latin American , [123]   Malaysian , [124]  and  Yemeni . [125]  communities, which number several thousand each. \n Religion \n Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King \n The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, [126]  including two Christian cathedrals. \n Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England. [127] \n The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican  Our Lady and St Nicholas , colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the  Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas  (built in the  Neo-Byzantine architecture  style), and the  Gustav Adolf Church  (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). \n Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The  Anglican Cathedral , which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual  Liverpool Shakespeare Festival , has one of the longest  naves , largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic  Metropolitan Cathedral , on Mount Pleasant next to  Liverpool Science Park , was initially planned to be even larger. Of  Sir Edwin Lutyens ' original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by  Sir Frederick Gibberd . While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design it still incorporates the largest panel of  stained glass  in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called  Hope Street , a coincidence which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape. [128] [nb 1] \nThe  Al-Rahma Mosque  in the Toxteth area of Liverpool \n Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed  Moorish Revival   Princes Road Synagogue  is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's  Moorish Revival  synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool. [129]  Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant  Jewish  community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the  Greenbank Park  area of L17 has recently closed, and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a  Lubavitch   Chabad House  and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000. [130]  The  Liverpool Talmudical College  existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue. \n Liverpool also has a  Hindu  community, with a  Mandir  on  Edge Lane ,  Edge Hill . The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there. [131]  Liverpool also has the  Guru Nanak   Sikh   Gurdwara  in  Wavertree [132]  and a  Bah\u00e1'\u00ed  Centre in the same area. [133] \n The city had the earliest mosque in England, and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by  William Abdullah Quilliam , a lawyer who had converted to  Islam , and set up the  Liverpool Muslim Institute  in a  terraced house  on West Derby Road. [134]  The building was used as a house of worship until 1908, when it was sold to the City Council and converted into offices. [135]  Plans have been accepted to re-convert the building where the mosque once stood into a museum. [136]  There are three mosques in Liverpool: the largest and main one,  Al-Rahma mosque , in the  Toxteth  area of the city and a mosque recently opened in the  Mossley Hill  district of the city. The third mosque was also recently opened in Toxteth and is on Granby Street. \n Demonymy and identity \n Natives of the city of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians, and colloquially as \"Scousers\", a reference to \" scouse \", a form of stew. [137]  The word \"Scouse\" has also become synonymous with the  Liverpool accent and dialect . Many people \"self-identify\" as Liverpudlians or Scousers without actually being born or living within the city boundaries of Liverpool. Moreover, since the advent of the  Liverpool City Region , its common Metro Mayor and emerging sense of self-determination and identity, [ citation needed ]  the term \"Liverpolitan\" [138]  is increasingly being used to refer to inhabitants of the entire Liverpool City Region, regardless of where the person might reside. [ citation needed ]  This is not to be confused with a Liverpudlian, an inhabitant of the city of Liverpool proper. [139] [140] [141]  In spite of these contrasting and overlapping identities, many people from within the greater Liverpool area still choose not to consider themselves part of the greater city, many choosing to espouse more parochial identites such as a \"Sandgrounder\", a person from  Southport . Conversely, a number of people from Liverpool itself may not consider themselves Scousers, since the term for them may have pejorative overtones. [ citation needed ] \n Economy \n Main article:  Economy of Liverpool \nApartment buildings within Liverpool's new  commercial district \n The Economy of Liverpool is one of the largest within the United Kingdom, sitting at the centre of one of the  two core economies  within the  North West of England . [142]  In 2006, the city's  GVA  was \u00a37,626 million, providing a per capita figure of \u00a317,489, which was above the North West average. [143]  Liverpool's economy has seen strong growth since the mid-1990s, with its GVA increasing 71.8% between 1995 and 2006 and employment increasing 12% between 1998 and 2006. [143]  GDP per capita was estimated to stand at $32,121 in 2014, and total GDP at $65.8 billion. [144] \n In common with much of the rest of the UK today, Liverpool's economy is dominated by  service sector industries , both public and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance sectors. [143]  Over recent years there has also been significant growth in the  knowledge economy  of Liverpool with the establishment of the  Liverpool Knowledge Quarter  in sectors such as media and life sciences. [145]  Liverpool's rich architectural base has also helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London, [146]  including doubling for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York, Paris and Rome. [147] [148] \n Liverpool One  has helped move the city into the top five retail destinations in the UK \n Another important component of Liverpool's economy are the tourism and  leisure sectors . Liverpool is the 6th most visited city in the United Kingdom [149]  and one of the 100 most visited cities in the world by international tourists. [150]  In 2008, during the city's  European Capital of Culture  celebrations, overnight visitors brought \u00a3188m into the local economy, [149]  while tourism as a whole is worth approximately \u00a31.3bn a year to Liverpool. [148]  The city's new  cruise liner terminal , which is situated close to the  Pier Head , also makes Liverpool one of the few places in the world where cruise ships are able to berth right in the centre of the city. [151]  Other recent developments in Liverpool such as the  Echo Arena  and  Liverpool One  have made Liverpool an important leisure centre with the latter helping to lift Liverpool into the top five retail destinations in the UK. [152] \nThe  Range Rover Evoque  is manufactured at  Jaguar Land Rover 's plant  at Halewood . \n Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the  city's port  and manufacturing base, although a smaller proportion of total employment is today derived from the port. [143]  Nonetheless the city remains one of the most important ports in the United Kingdom, handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008. [153]  A new multimillion-pound expansion to the Port of Liverpool,  Liverpool2 , is scheduled to be operational from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle. [154]  Liverpool is also home to the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm  NYK  and Danish firm  Maersk Line , whilst shipping firm  Atlantic Container Line  has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, with a new headquarters currently under construction. [155] [156] [157]  Future plans to redevelop the city's northern dock system, in a project known as  Liverpool Waters , could see \u00a35.5bn invested in the city over the next 50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs. [158] \n Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the  Jaguar Land Rover   Halewood  plant where the  Range Rover Evoque  model is assembled. \n Landmarks \n Main articles:  Architecture of Liverpool  and  Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City \n See also:  List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool  and  List of public art in Liverpool \nLiverpool's Three Graces, the  Royal Liver Building ,  Cunard Building  and  Port of Liverpool Building  at the  Pier Head \n Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of  architectural styles  found within the city, ranging from 16th century  Tudor buildings  to modern-day  contemporary architecture . [159]  The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the  British Empire . [160]  There are over  2,500 listed buildings  in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed [161]  and 85 are Grade II* listed. [162]  The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from  Westminster [163]  and more Georgian houses than the city of  Bath . [164]  This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by  English Heritage , as England's finest Victorian city. [165]  The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a  UNESCO   World Heritage Site . Known as the  Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City , the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of  international trade  and  docking  technology. [166] \n Waterfront and docks \nThe  Albert Dock  contains the UK's largest collection of Grade I listed buildings as well as being the most visited multi-use attraction outside London \n As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed  wet dock  (the  Old Dock ) in 1715 and the first ever  hydraulic  lifting  cranes . [167]  The best-known dock in Liverpool is the  Albert Dock , which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain. [168]  Built under the guidance of  Jesse Hartley , it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the  Merseyside Maritime Museum ,  International Slavery Museum ,  Tate Liverpool  and  The Beatles Story . North of the city centre is  Stanley Dock , home to the  Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse , which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area [169]  and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building. [170] \n One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the  Pier Head , renowned for the trio of buildings \u2013 the  Royal Liver Building , the  Cunard Building  and the  Port of Liverpool Building  \u2013 which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the  Three Graces , these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of Maritime Liverpool, and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world. [171] [172] [173] [174] \n Bluecoat Chambers , the oldest building in Liverpool city centre \n In recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are the  Museum of Liverpool , the construction of the  Echo Arena Liverpool  and BT Convention Centre on  Kings Dock ,  Alexandra Tower  and  1 Princes Dock  on  Prince's Dock  and Liverpool Marina around  Coburg  and  Brunswick Docks .  The Wheel of Liverpool  opened on 25 March 2010. [175] [176] \n Commercial district and cultural quarter \nVictoria Street like many streets in the city centre is lined with dozens of listed buildings \n Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'. [177] \n The  commercial district  is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their  medieval  layout. Having developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's World Heritage site. [178] \nThe  neo-classical   St George's Hall \n The oldest building in the area is the  Grade I   listed   Liverpool Town Hall , which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of  Georgian architecture , the building is noted as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain. [179] [180]  Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed  Bank of England Building , constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank. [179]  Amongst the other noted buildings in the area are the  Tower Buildings ,  Albion House  (the former  White Star Line  headquarters), the  Municipal Buildings  and  Oriel Chambers , [181]  which is considered to be one of the earliest  Modernist  style buildings ever built. [182] \n The area around  William Brown Street  is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the  William Brown Library ,  Walker Art Gallery ,  Picton Reading Rooms  and  World Museum Liverpool . The area is dominated by  neo-classical architecture , of which the most prominent,  St George's Hall , [183]  is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe. [184]  A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \" S.P.Q.L. \" (Latin  senatus populusque Liverpudliensis ), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including  Wellington's Column  and the  Steble Fountain . Many others are located around the area, particularly in  St John's Gardens , which was specifically developed for this purpose. [185]  The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the  Roman Forum . [186] \n Other notable landmarks \n Speke Hall   Tudor   manor house  is one of Liverpool's oldest buildings \n West Tower  has been the  city's tallest building  since completion in 2008 \n While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is  Speke Hall , a  Tudor   manor house  located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598. [187]  The building is one of the few remaining  timber framed  Tudor houses left in the  north of England  and is particularly noted for its  Victorian  interior, which was added in the mid-19th century. [188]  In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former  manor houses  including  Croxteth Hall  and  Woolton Hall , which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively. [189]  The oldest building within the city centre is the  Grade I   listed   Bluecoat Chambers , [190]  which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style, [191] [192]  the building was influenced in part by the work of  Christopher Wren [193]  and was originally the home of the  Bluecoat School  (who later moved to larger site in the south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool. [191] \n Liverpool Cathedral  is regarded as one of the greatest buildings of the twentieth century and is one of the largest church buildings in the world \n Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it. [194]  The  Anglican Cathedral , which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain [195]  and the  fifth largest in the world . Designed and built in  Gothic style , it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century [196]  and was described by former British  Poet Laureate ,  John Betjeman , as 'one of the great buildings of the world'. [197]  The Roman Catholic  Metropolitan Cathedral  was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is noted as one of the first Cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design. [198] \n In recent years, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. The largest of these developments has been  Liverpool One , which has seen almost \u00a31 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (170,000\u00a0m 2 ) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space. [199]  Around the north of the city centre several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the  RIBA  award-winning  Unity Buildings  and  West Tower , which at 140m is  Liverpool's tallest building . Many future redevelopment schemes are also planned including  Central Village  (planning permission granted), [200]  the  Lime Street  gateway (work started) [201]  and the highly ambitious  Liverpool Waters  (early planning stage). [202] \n There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the  art deco   former terminal building  of  Speke Airport , the  University of Liverpool 's  Victoria Building , (which provided the inspiration for the term  Red Brick University ), and the  Adelphi Hotel , which was in that past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world. [203] \n Parks and gardens \n The English Heritage National Register of Historic Parks describes Merseyside's  Victorian Parks  as collectively the \"most important in the country\". [204]  The city of Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London. [205] \n Transport \n Main article:  Transport in Liverpool \nThe Wallasey entrance to the  Kingsway Tunnel . Liverpool's skyline is visible in the background \n Transport in Liverpool is primarily centred on the city's road and rail networks, both of which are extensive and provide links across the United Kingdom. Liverpool has an extensive local public transport network, which is managed by the  Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive , and includes buses, trains and ferries. Additionally, the city also has an international airport and a major port, both of which provides links to locations outside the country. \n National and international travel \n Road links \n As a major city, Liverpool has direct road links with many other areas within England. To the east, the  M62 motorway  connects Liverpool with  Hull  and along the route provides links to several large cities, including  Manchester ,  Leeds  and  Bradford . The M62 also provides a connection to both the  M6 motorway  and  M1 Motorway , providing indirect links to more distant areas including  Birmingham ,  Sheffield ,  Preston , London and  Nottingham . [206]  To the west of the city, the  Kingsway  and  Queensway Tunnels  connect Liverpool with the  Wirral Peninsula , providing links to both  Birkenhead , and  Wallasey . The  A41 road , which begins in Birkenhead, also provides links to  Cheshire  and  Shropshire  and via the  A55 road ,  North Wales . [207]  To the south, Liverpool is connected to  Widnes  and  Warrington  via the  A562 road  and subsequently across the  River Mersey  to  Runcorn , via the  Silver Jubilee  and  Mersey Gateway  bridges. \n Liverpool Lime Street Station \n Rail links \n Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by  Merseyrail  and provides links throughout Merseyside and beyond (see Local Travel below), while the national network, which is managed by  Network Rail , provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across the England. The city's primary mainline station is  Lime Street station , which acts as a terminus for several lines into the city. Train services from Lime Street provide connections to numerous destinations, including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with  Pendolino  trains),  Birmingham ,  Newcastle upon Tyne , Manchester,  Preston ,  Leeds ,  Scarborough ,  Sheffield ,  Nottingham  and  Norwich . In the south of the city,  Liverpool South Parkway  provides a connection to the city's airport. \n Port \n The  Port of Liverpool  is one of Britain's largest ports, providing passenger ferry services across the  Irish Sea  to  Belfast , Dublin and the  Isle of Man . Services are provided by several companies, including the  Isle of Man Steam Packet Company ,  P&O Ferries  and  Stena Line . In 2007, a new  cruise terminal  was opened in Liverpool, located alongside the  Pier Head  in the city centre. November 2016 saw the official opening of  Liverpool2 , an extension to the port that allows  post-Panamax  vessels to dock in Liverpool. [208] \n Airport \n Liverpool John Lennon Airport  terminal building \n Liverpool John Lennon Airport , which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. In 2008, the airport handled over 5.3 million passengers [209]  and today offers services to 68 destinations, [210]  including Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Barcelona and Z\u00fcrich. The airport is primarily served by  low-cost airlines , notably  Ryanair  and  Easyjet , although it does provide additional charter services in the summer. \n Local travel \n Trains \nThe  Merseyrail  network has extensive underground sections within the city centre.  Liverpool Central  is the UK's busiest underground station outside London \n Liverpool's  local rail  network is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network consists of three lines: the  Northern Line , which runs to  Southport ,  Ormskirk ,  Kirkby  and  Hunts Cross ; the  Wirral Line , which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to  New Brighton ,  West Kirby ,  Chester  and  Ellesmere Port ; and the  City Line , which begins at  Lime Street , providing links to  St Helens ,  Wigan ,  Preston ,  Warrington  and  Manchester . \n The network is predominantly electric. Electrification of the City Line was completed in 2015. The two lines operated by Merseyrail are the busiest British urban commuter networks outside London, covering 75 miles (121\u00a0km) of track, with an average of 100,000 passenger journeys per weekday. [211] [212]  Services are operated by the  Merseyrail  franchise and managed by the  Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive . It should be noted that local services on the City Line are operated by  Northern  rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within the city centre the majority of the network is underground, with four city centre stations and over 6.5 miles (10.5\u00a0km) of tunnels. [211] \n Buses \n MV Royal Iris of the Mersey  is one of three ferries that provide cross river services between Liverpool and the Wirral \n Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by the  Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive  (more commonly known as Merseytravel) [213]  and are run by several different companies, including  Arriva  and  Stagecoach . The two principal termini for local buses are  Queen Square Bus Station  (located near  Lime Street railway station ) for services north and east of the city, and  Liverpool One Bus Station formerly known as Paradise Street Bus Interchange  (located near the  Albert Dock ) for services to the south and east. Cross-river services to the  Wirral  use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A  night bus service  also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and Merseyside. [214] \n Mersey Ferry \n The cross river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the  Mersey Ferry , is managed and operated by  Merseytravel , with services operating between the  Pier Head  in Liverpool and both  Woodside  in  Birkenhead  and  Seacombe  in  Wallasey . Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and during weekends. [215]  Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the  River Mersey  and surrounding areas. [216] \n Cycling \n In May 2014, the CityBike hire scheme was launched in the city and was expanded in 2015. The cycle hire scheme has been successful and has been well received by the residents of Liverpool. \n Culture \n As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife amongst others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of  European Capital of Culture , during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including  Go Superlambananas!  and  La Princesse . Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the  Welsh national Eisteddfod , three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929. \n Music \n Main articles:  Music of Liverpool  and  Beat music \nLiverpool was the birthplace of  The Beatles \n Main article:  Culture of Liverpool \n Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by  Guinness World Records  as the  World Capital City of Pop . [217]  Musicians from the city have produced 56 number one singles, more than any other city in the world. [218] [219]  Both the most successful  male band  and  girl group  in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of  The Beatles  and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the  Beat Music  movement, which would eventually lead to the  British Invasion . Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including  Billy J Kramer ,  Cilla Black ,  Gerry and the Pacemakers  and  The Searchers . The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the  Liverpool poets , prompted American poet  Allen Ginsberg  to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\". [220]  Other musicians from Liverpool include  Billy Fury ,  A Flock of Seagulls ,  Echo and the Bunnymen ,  Frankie Goes to Hollywood ,  Frankie Vaughan  and more recently  Anathema ,  Ladytron ,  The Zutons ,  Atomic Kitten ,  Heidi Range  and  Rebecca Ferguson . \n Philharmonic Hall , home of the  Royal Liverpool Philharmonic \n The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional  symphony orchestra  in the UK, the  Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra , which is based in the  Philharmonic Hall . [221]  The chief conductor of the orchestra is  Vasily Petrenko . [222]  Sir  Edward Elgar  dedicated his famous  Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1  to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901. [223]  Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9  Fritz Spiegl  is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of  Scouse , but composed the music to  Z-cars  and the  Radio 4 UK Theme . \n The  Mathew Street Festival  is an annual street festival that is one of the most important musical events in Liverpool's calendar. It is Europe's largest free music event and takes place every August. [224]  Other well established festivals in the city include  Africa Oy\u00e9  and  Brazilica  which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively. [225] [226]  The dance music festival  Creamfields  was established by the famous Liverpool-based  Cream  clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however the  Echo Arena  is by far the largest. Opened in 2008 the 11,000-seat arena hosted the  MTV Europe Music Awards  the same year and since then has held host to world-renowned acts such as  Andrea Bocelli ,  Beyonc\u00e9 ,  Elton John ,  Kanye West ,  Kasabian ,  The Killers ,  Lady Gaga ,  Oasis ,  Pink ,  Rihanna ,  UB40 . \n Visual arts \n William Brown Street , also known as the Cultural Quarter is a World Heritage Site consisting of the  World Museum ,  Central Library ,  Picton Reading Room  and  Walker Art Gallery \n Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London. [227]   National Museums Liverpool  is the only English national collection based wholly outside London. [228]  The  Tate Liverpool  gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of  Tate Modern , the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The  FACT centre  hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the  Walker Art Gallery  houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of  Pre-Raphaelite  art in the world. [229]   Sudley House  contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art. [230]  Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the University's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by  Audubon  outside the US. [231]  A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter  George Stubbs  who was born in Liverpool in 1724. \n The  Liverpool Biennial  festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide. [232]  It was during the 2004 festival that  Yoko Ono 's work \"My mother is beautiful\" caused widespread public protest when photographs of a naked woman's pubic area were exhibited on the main shopping street. \n Nelson Monument  at Exchange Flags. The other British hero of the Napoleonic Wars is commemorated in  Wellington's Column \n Literature \n Felicia Hemans  (n\u00e9e Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the  Venetian   consul  in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to  Denbighshire  in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and  St. Asaph  ( Flintshire ), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the  Prince of Wales , were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of  Percy Bysshe Shelley , who briefly corresponded with her.  [233] \n A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including  Daniel Defoe ,  Washington Irving ,  Thomas De Quincey ,  Herman Melville ,  Nathaniel Hawthorne ,  Charles Dickens ,  Gerard Manley Hopkins  and  Hugh Walpole .  Daniel Defoe , after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his \"'Tour through England and Wales . [234]   Herman Melville 's novel  Redburn  deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections. [233]  Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856. [235]  Charles Dickens visited the city on numerous occasions to give public readings. [236]  Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81. [237]  Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool,  Jung  famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works. [238] \n Of all the poets who are connected with Liverpool, perhaps the greatest is  Constantine P. Cavafy , a twentieth-century Greek cultural icon, although he was born in Alexandria. From a wealthy family, his father had business interests in Egypt, London and Liverpool. After his father's death, Cavafy's mother brought him in 1872 at the age of nine to Liverpool where he spent part of his childhood being educated. He lived first in Balmoral Road, then when the family firm crashed, he lived in poorer circumstances in Huskisson Street. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in Liverpool. In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the Long Depression of 1873, so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria. [233] \n Her Benny , a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher  Silas K. Hocking , was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime. [239]  The prolific writer of adventure novels,  Harold Edward Bindloss  (1866\u20131945), was born in Liverpool. \n The writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in  Secombe , on the  Wirral Peninsula  in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool\u2013Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the  Unity Theatre  in the 1930s as part of the  Popular Front  against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the  Spanish Civil War . Garrett died in 1966. [240] \n The novelist and playwright  James Hanley  (1897\u20131985) was born in  Kirkdale , Liverpool, in 1897 (not  Dublin , nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family. [241]  Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen.  The Furys  (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist  Gerald Hanley  (1916\u201392) was also born in Liverpool (not  County Cork , Ireland, as he claimed). [242]  While he published a number of novels he also wrote  radio plays  for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably  The Blue Max  (1966). [243]  He was also one of several script writers for a life of  Gandhi  (1964). [244]  Novelist  Beryl Bainbridge  (1932\u20132010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby  Formby . She was primarily known for her works of  psychological fiction , often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the  Whitbread Awards  prize for best novel in  1977  and  1996  and was nominated five times for the  Booker Prize .  The Times  newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest  British writers  since 1945\". [245] \n J. G. Farrell  was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939. [246]  A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his  Empire Trilogy  ( Troubles ,  The Siege of Krishnapur  and  The Singapore Grip ), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. \n Helen Forrester  was the pen name of June Bhatia (n\u00e9e Huband) (1919\u20132011), [247] [248]  who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the  Great Depression , including  Twopence to Cross the Mersey  (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the  Liverpool poets , who include  Roger McGough  and the late  Adrian Henri . An anthology of poems,  The Mersey Sound , written by Henri, McGough and  Brian Patten , has sold well since it was first being published in 1967. \n Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside \u2013  Ramsey Campbell ,  Clive Barker  and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction,  Spook City  was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool. [249]  Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the  Hellraiser  series of films. \n Performing arts \nThe  Empire Theatre  has the largest two tier auditorium in the UK \n Liverpool also has a history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the  Liverpool Shakespeare Festival  which takes place inside  Liverpool Cathedral  and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer, The Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country, [250]  Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre, organised by Tmesis, [251]  the annual festivals run by John Moores University Drama department and LIPA, and by the number of theatres in the city. These include the  Empire ,  Everyman ,  Liverpool Playhouse ,  Neptune ,  Royal Court  and  Unity  theatres. The Everyman and Playhouse are now both part of one company, and both houses produce their own work as well as receiving touring productions. [252] [253]  The Everyman was rebuilt between 2011 and 2014, with the previous building being demolished and a new venue constructed on the same site. [254] [255]  Some notable actors from Liverpool include;  Rex Harrison  (Henry Higgins in  My Fair Lady ),  Malcolm McDowell  ( Alex DeLarge  in  A Clockwork Orange ),  Tom Baker  ( fourth incarnation  of  the Doctor  in  Doctor Who ) and  Jason Isaacs  ( Lucius Malfoy  in the  Harry Potter  films). \n Nightlife \n Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife, with the majority of the city's late night bars, pubs, nightclubs, live music venues and comedy clubs being located in a number of distinct districts. A 2011  TripAdvisor  poll voted Liverpool as having the best nightlife of any UK city, ahead of  Manchester ,  Leeds  and even London. [256]   Concert Square , St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel, Duke and  Hardman Streets  are home to some of Liverpool's largest and most famed nightclubs including  Alma de Cuba ,  Blue Angel , Bumper, Chibuku, Heebie Jeebies,  Korova , The Krazyhouse, The Magnet,  Nation  (home of the  Cream brand , and Medication, the UK's largest and longest running weekly student event), Popworld as well as countless other smaller establishments and chain bars. Another popular nightlife destination in the city centre is  Mathew Street  and the  Gay Quarter , located close to the city's commercial district, this area is famed for  The Cavern Club  alongside numerous gay bars including Garlands and G-Bar. The  Albert Dock  and  Lark Lane  in Aigburth also contain an abundance of bars and late night venues. \n Education \n University of Liverpool 's  Victoria Building \n See also:  List of schools in Liverpool \n In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular,  Church of England ,  Jewish , and Roman Catholic.  Islamic  education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's important early schools was  The Liverpool Blue Coat School ; founded in 1708 as a charitable school. \n The Liverpool Blue Coat School  is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels. [257]  Other notable schools include  Liverpool College  founded in 1840  Merchant Taylors' School  founded in 1620. [258]  Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is  St. Edward's College  situated in the West Derby area of the city.

It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science. \n Liverpool Community College 's Arts Centre \n Liverpool Hope University , which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe. [259]  It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). \n The  Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the  University of Liverpool  and houses an anti-venom repository. \n Liverpool John Moores University  was previously a  polytechnic , and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of  Sir John Moores , one of the founders of the  Littlewoods  football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool  Mechanics Institute , opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university. \n The city has one  further education  colleges,  Liverpool Community College  in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates  Burton Manor , a residential  adult education  college in nearby  Burton , on the  Wirral Peninsula . \n There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation.

The clubs both compete in the  Premier League , of which they are founding members, and contest the  Merseyside Derby , dubbed the 'friendly derby' despite there having been more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. [260]  However, unlike many other derbies, it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs. [261]  Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most  European Cup  titles with five, the latest in  2005 . \n Everton F.C.  were founded in 1878 and play at  Goodison Park  and  Liverpool F.C.  were founded in 1892 and play at  Anfield . Many high-profile players have played for the clubs, including  Dixie Dean ,  Alan Ball ,  Gary Lineker ,  Neville Southall  and  Wayne Rooney  for  Everton F.C.  and  Kenny Dalglish ,  Alan Hansen ,  Kevin Keegan ,  Ian Rush  and  Steven Gerrard  for  Liverpool F.C. . Notable managers of the clubs include  Harry Catterick  and  Howard Kendall  of Everton, and  Bill Shankly  and  Bob Paisley  of Liverpool. Famous professional footballers from Liverpool include  Peter Reid ,  Gary Ablett ,  Wayne Rooney ,  Steven Gerrard ,  Jamie Carragher  and  Tony Hibbert . The City of Liverpool is the only one in England to have staged top division football every single season since the formation of the  Football League  in 1888, and both of the city's clubs play in high-capacity stadiums. \n Boxing \n Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Ike Bradley,  Alan Rudkin ,  John Conteh , Andy Holligan,  Paul Smith ,  Shea Neary ,  Tony Bellew  and  David Price . The city also boasts a consistently strong amateur contingent which is highlighted by Liverpool being the most represented city on the  GB Boxing  team, as well as at the  2012 London Olympics , the most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include;  George Turpin ,  Tony Willis ,  Robin Reid  and  David Price  who have all medalled at the  Olympic Games . Boxing events are usually hosted at the  Echo Arena  and  Liverpool Olympia  within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned  Liverpool Stadium . \n Horse racing \nThe Earl of Derby Stand at  Aintree Racecourse ; home of the  Grand National \n Aintree  is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, the  John Smith's Grand National  which takes place annually in early April. The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to compete in the demanding 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) and 30 fence course. There have been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance the 100/1 outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant  Red Rum  and  Ginger McCain  of the 1970s and  Mon Mome  (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National became the first horse race to be televised in  high-definition  in the UK. \n Golf \n The  Royal Liverpool Golf Club , situated in the nearby town of  Hoylake  on the Wirral Peninsula, has hosted  The Open Championship  on a number of occasions, most recently in  2014 . It also hosted the  Walker Cup  in 1983. \nThe  Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake \n Greyhound Racing \n Liverpool once contained four greyhound tracks,  Seaforth Greyhound Stadium  (1933-1965),  Breck Park Stadium  (1927-1948),  Stanley Greyhound Stadium  (1927-1961) and  White City Stadium  (1932-1973). Breck Park also hosted boxing bouts and both Stanley and Seaforth hosted  Motorcycle speedway . \n Other sports \n Wavertree Sports Park  is home to the Liverpool Harriers athletics club which, over the years has produced such athletes as; JT Rimmer,  Allyn Condon  \u2013 the only British athlete to compete at both the Summer & Winter Olympics,  Curtis Robb  and  Katrina Johnson-Thompson  \u2013 who represented GB at the  2012 London Olympics  in the women's heptathlon. \n In August 2012, Liverpool gymnast  Beth Tweddle  won an Olympic bronze medal in  London 2012  in the uneven bars at her third  Olympic Games , thus becoming the most decorated British gymnast in history. Park Road Gymnastics Centre provides training to a high level. \n Liverpool has produced several famous swimmers who have gone on to represent their nation at major championships such as the  Olympic Games . The most notable of which is  Steve Parry  who claimed a bronze medal at the  2004 Athens Olympics  in the 200m butterfly. Others include Herbert Nickel Haresnape,  Margaret Kelly , Shellagh Ratcliffe and Austin Rawlinson. There is a purpose-built aquatics centre at  Wavertree Sports Park , which opened in 2008. The City of Liverpool Swimming Club has been National Speedo League Champions 8 out of the last 11 years. \n The city is the hub of the  Liverpool and District Cricket Competition , an  ECB   Premier League . [262]   Sefton Park  and  Liverpool  are the league's founder members based in the city with Wavertree, Alder and Old Xaverians clubs having joined the league more recently. [263]  Liverpool plays host  Lancashire County Cricket Club  as an outground most seasons, including six of eight home  County Championship  games during Lancashire's 2011 [264]  title winning campaign [265]  whilst  Old Trafford  was refurbished. [266] [267] \n Since 2014  Liverpool Cricket Club  has played host [268]  to the annual  Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International  tennis tournament, which has seen tennis stars such as  Novak Djokovic ,  David Ferrer ,  Mardy Fish ,  Laura Robson  and  Caroline Wozniacki . Previously this had been held at  Calderstones Park , situated in  Allerton  in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. \nThe  Echo Arena  hosts numerous sporting events and was formerly the home of  British Basketball League  team, the  Mersey Tigers \n Professional basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, now known as  Mersey Tigers , into the elite  British Basketball League . The club was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the  Toxteth Tigers  youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people every year. [269]  The Tigers began play in Britain's top league for the  2007\u201308 season , playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into the newly completed  Echo Arena  during that season. After the 2009\u201310 season, Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name to Mersey Tigers. Their closest professional rivals are the  Cheshire Jets , based 18 miles (29\u00a0km) away in  Chester . \n Liverpool is one of three cities which still host the traditional sport of  British baseball  and it hosts the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating with  Cardiff  and  Newport . Liverpool Trojans are the oldest existing baseball club in the UK. \n The  2014 Tour of Britain  cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, utilising a city centre circuit to complete 130\u00a0km (80.8\u00a0mi) of racing. [270]  The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September. \n A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population. [271] \n Sports stadiums \n Anfield , home of  Liverpool F.C. \n Liverpool is home to the  Premier League  football clubs  Everton  and  Liverpool F.C.   Liverpool  have played at  Anfield  since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following  Everton's  departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994\u201395) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star  UEFA Elite Stadium  with capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort, and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. \n After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to  Goodison Park  on the opposite side of  Stanley Park . Goodison Park was the first major football stadium built in England.  Molineux  (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced grounds. Rangers opened  Ibrox  in 1887, while  Celtic Park  was officially inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous transformation at Mere Green, spending up to \u00a33000 on laying out the ground and erecting stands on three sides. For \u00a3552 Mr. Barton prepared the land at 4\u00bdd a square yard. Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost of \u00a31,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further \u00a3150, gates and sheds cost \u00a3132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another \u00a37 15s to the bill. \n Goodison Park , home of  Everton F.C \n The ground was immediately renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But instead of a match the 12,000 crowd saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4\u20132. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. \n Everton are currently looking to relocate. The club have had previously raised the subject before in 1996, and in 2003 were forced to scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at  King's Dock  due to financial reasons. The latest plan has been to move beyond Liverpool's council boundary to  Kirkby , but this has proved controversial with some fans, as well as members of the local community. At one point there was much talk for Everton to ground-share with Liverpool, at the proposed new Stanley Park Stadium, but this was not progressed by either club. \n Media \n Radio City Tower , home to  Radio City  and a number of subsidiary stations \n The  ITV  region which covers Liverpool is  ITV Granada . In 2006, the Television company opened a new newsroom in the Royal Liver Building. Granada's regional news broadcasts were produced at the  Albert Dock  News Centre during the 1980s and 1990s. [272]  The  BBC  also opened a new newsroom on Hanover Street in 2006. \n ITV's daily magazine programme  This Morning  was famously broadcast from studios at  Albert Dock  until 1996, when production was moved to London. Granada's short-lived shopping channel \"Shop!\" was also produced in Liverpool until it was axed in 2002. \n Liverpool is the home of the TV production company  Lime Pictures , formerly Mersey Television, which produced the now-defunct soap operas  Brookside  and  Grange Hill . It also produces the soap opera  Hollyoaks , which was formerly filmed in  Chester  and began on  Channel 4  in 1995. All three series were/are largely filmed in the  Childwall  area of Liverpool. \n The city has one daily newspaper: the  Echo , published by the Trinity Mirror group.  The Liverpool Daily Post  was also published until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called  Southport Reporter  ( Southport and  Mersey Reporter ), is also one of the many other news outlets that covers the city. \n Radio stations include  BBC Radio Merseyside ,  Capital Liverpool ,  Radio City ,  Radio City 2  and  Radio City Talk . The last three are located in  Radio City Tower  which, along with the two cathedrals, dominates the city's skyline. The independent media organisation  Indymedia  also covers Liverpool, while  Nerve  magazine  publishes articles and reviews of cultural events. \n Liverpool has also featured in films; [273]  see  List of films set in Liverpool  for some of them. In films the city has \"doubled\" for London, Paris, New York, Chicago, [274]  Moscow, Dublin, Venice and Berlin.

We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once\u00a0...\" \u2013  J.B. Priestley ,  English Journey , 1934 \n \"...if Liverpool can get into top gear again there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing \u2013 it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas \u2013 Dublin, or Boston, or Hamburg. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the First World War, were the abilities of the architects who built over it\u2026\u2026 The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale.
