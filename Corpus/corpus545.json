[9] [10]   Livonian  is considered an  indigenous language  and has special legal status. [11]   Latgalian  written language and  Latvian Sign Language  also have special legal status. [12] \n Latvia is  de jure  continuous with its declaration of 18 November 1918. \n The  .eu  domain is also used, as it is shared with other  European Union  member states. \n Latvia ,  / \u02c8 l \u00e6 t v i \u0259 / \u00a0( \u00a0 listen ) ;  Latvian :  Latvija   [\u02c8latvija] ), officially the  Republic of Latvia  ( Latvian :  Latvijas Republika ), is a country in the  Baltic region  of  Northern Europe , one of the three  Baltic states . [13]  It is bordered by  Estonia  to the north,  Lithuania  to the south,  Russia  to the east, and  Belarus  to the southeast, as well as sharing a  maritime border  with  Sweden  to the west. Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants [14]  and a territory of 64,589\u00a0km 2  (24,938\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [15]  The country has a  temperate seasonal climate . [16] \n After centuries of  Swedish ,  Livonian ,  Polish  and  Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the  privileged   Baltic German   aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 after declaring independence from  Russia  in the aftermath of  World War I . [2]  However, by the 1930s, the country became increasingly autocratic after the  coup in 1934  establishing an authoritarian regime under  K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country's  de facto  independence was interrupted at the outset of  World War II , beginning with Latvia's  forcible incorporation  into the  Soviet Union , followed by the  invasion and occupation  by  Nazi Germany  in 1941, and the  re-occupation by the Soviets  in 1944 to form the  Latvian SSR  for the next fifty years. The peaceful  Singing Revolution , starting in 1987, called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the \"Stalinist\" regime's illegal takeover. [17]  It ended with the  Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia  on 4 May 1990, and restoring de facto  independence  on 21 August 1991. [18] \n Latvia is a democratic  republic  and a highly developed country [ citation needed ] . Its capital  Riga  served as the  European Capital of Culture in 2014 .  Latvian  is the official language. Latvia is a  unitary state , divided into 119  administrative divisions , of which 110 are municipalities and 9 are cities. [19]  Latvians are the indigenous people of Latvia. [15]   Latvian  and  Lithuanian  are the only two surviving  Baltic languages . Despite foreign rule from the 13th to 20th centuries, the Latvian nation maintained its identity throughout the generations via the language and musical traditions. As a consequence of centuries of Russian rule (1710\u20131918) and later  Soviet occupation , Latvia is home to a large number of  ethnic Russians  (26.9% in  Latvia [20] ), some of whom (14.1% of Latvian residents) have not gained citizenship, leaving them with  no citizenship  at all. Until World War II, Latvia also had significant minorities of ethnic  Germans  and  Jews . Latvia is historically predominantly  Protestant   Lutheran , except for the  Latgale  region in the southeast, which has historically been predominantly  Roman Catholic . [21]  The Russian population has also brought a significant portion of  Eastern Orthodox  Christians. \n It is a member of the  European Union ,  NATO , the  Council of Europe , the  United Nations ,  CBSS , the  IMF ,  NB8 ,  NIB ,  OECD ,  OSCE , and  WTO . For 2014, Latvia was listed 46th on the  Human Development Index  and as a  high income country  on 1 July 2014. [22] [23]  A full member of the  Eurozone , it uses the  euro  as its currency since 1 January 2014, replacing the  Latvian lats .

[25]   Henry of Latvia  coined the  latinisations  of the country's name, \"Lettigallia\" and \"Lethia\", both derived from the Latgalians. The terms inspired the variations on the country's name in  Romance languages  from \"Letonia\" and in several  Germanic languages  from \"Lettland\". [26] \n History [ edit ] \n Main article:  History of Latvia \n Around 3000 BC, the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the  Baltic Sea . [27]  The  Balts  established trade routes to Rome and  Byzantium , trading local  amber  for precious metals. [28]  By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia:  Curonians ,  Latgalians ,  Selonians ,  Semigallians  (in Latvian:  kur\u0161i ,  latga\u013ci ,  s\u0113\u013ci  and  zemga\u013ci ), as well as the  Livonians  ( l\u012bbie\u0161i ) speaking a Finnic language. [ citation needed ] \n In the 12th century in the territory of Latvia, there were 14 lands with their rulers:  Vanema ,  Ventava ,  Bandava ,  Piemare ,  Duvzare ,  Ceklis ,  Megava ,  Pils\u0101ts ,  Upmale ,  S\u0113lija ,  Koknese ,  Jersika ,  T\u0101lava  and  Adzele . [29] \n The Medieval period [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Terra Mariana ,  Livonian Crusade , and  Northern Crusades \n Terra Mariana , medieval Livonia \n Turaida Castle  near  Sigulda , built in 1214 under  Albert of Riga \nIn 1282,  Riga  became a member of the  Hanseatic League . \n Although the local people had had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century. [30]  The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the  Daugava River  in the late 12th century, seeking converts. [31]  The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the Church had hoped. [31]   German crusaders  were sent, or more likely decided to go on their own accord as they were known to do in search of pagans to kill and loot throughout eastern Europe.  Saint Meinhard of Segeberg  arrived in Ik\u0161\u0137ile, in 1184, traveling with merchants to Livonia, on a Catholic mission to convert the population from their original  pagan  beliefs. Pope Celestine III had called for  a crusade against pagans in Northern Europe  in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, Meinhard plotted to convert Livonians by force of arms. [32] \n In the beginning of the 13th century, Germans ruled large parts of today's Latvia. [31]  Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the  crusader state  that became known as  Terra Mariana  or Livonia. In 1282, Riga, and later the cities of  C\u0113sis ,  Limba\u017ei ,  Koknese  and  Valmiera , became part of the  Hanseatic League . [31]  Riga became an important point of east-west trading [31]  and formed close cultural links with  Western Europe . [ citation needed ] \n The Reformation period and Polish-Lithuanian rule [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Swedish Livonia ,  Duchy of Courland and Semigallia ,  Duchy of Livonia , and  Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth \nThe  Swedish Empire  (1560\u20131815). \nRiga became the capital of  Swedish Livonia  and the largest city in the Swedish Empire. \n After the  Livonian War  (1558\u20131583), Livonia (Latvia) fell under  Polish and Lithuanian  rule. [31]  The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the  Grand Duchy of Lithuania  and formed into the  Ducatus Ultradunensis  (P\u0101rdaugavas hercogiste).  Gotthard Kettler , the last Master of the  Order of Livonia , formed the  Duchy of Courland and Semigallia . [33]  Though the duchy was a vassal state to Poland, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century.  Latgalia , the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the  Inflanty Voivodeship  of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. [34] \n In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth,  Sweden , and  Russia  struggled for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the  Polish\u2013Swedish War , northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. Riga became the capital of  Swedish Livonia  and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire. [35]  Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the  Truce of Altmark  in 1629. [ citation needed ]  In Latvia, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive;  serfdom  was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional  barons  was diminished. [36] [37] \n Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted  Lutheranism  as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the  Latvian people , speaking one  Latvian language . Throughout all the centuries, however, an actual Latvian state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Latvia, southern Latgallians adopted  Catholicism  under Polish/ Jesuit  influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords. [38] \n Latvia in the Russian Empire (1710\u20131917) [ edit ] \n The  capitulation of Estonia and Livonia  in 1710 and the  Treaty of Nystad , ending the  Great Northern War  in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the  Riga Governorate ). [ citation needed ]  The Latgale region remained part of the  Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth  as  Inflanty Voivodeship  until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The  Duchy of Courland and Semigallia  became an  autonomous  Russian province (the  Courland Governorate ) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the  Russian Empire . All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local  official language  and their own parliament, the  Landtag . [ citation needed ] \n During the  Great Northern War  (1700\u20131721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague. [39]  Half the residents of Riga were killed by  plague in 1710\u20131711 . [40] \n The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819. [ citation needed ]  In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility, [ citation needed ]  as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates \"of their own free will\". [ citation needed ] \n During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically. [ citation needed ]  A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained. [ citation needed ]  There also developed a growing urban  proletariat  and an increasingly influential Latvian  bourgeoisie . The  Young Latvian  ( Latvian :  Jaunlatvie\u0161i ) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the  Slavophiles  for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order. [ citation needed ]  The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the  First National Awakening .  Russification  began in Latgale after the Polish led the  January Uprising  in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s. [ citation needed ]  The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the  New Current , a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. Popular discontent exploded in the  1905 Russian Revolution , which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces. [ citation needed ] \n During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom \u2013 ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire), railways built; new factories, banks, and a University were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums), and school buildings were erected; new parks formed; and so on. Riga's boulevards and some streets outside the Old Town date from this period. [ citation needed ] \n Worth mentioning is the fact that  numeracy  was also higher in the Estonian and Latvian parts of the Russian Empire, which may have been influenced by the Protestant religion of the inhabitants. [41] \n Declaration of independence [ edit ] \n K\u0101rlis Ulmanis \n World War I  devastated the territory of what became the state of Latvia, and other western parts of the Russian Empire. Demands for  self-determination  were initially confined to  autonomy , until a power vacuum was created by the  Russian Revolution  in 1917, followed by the  Treaty of Brest-Litovsk  between Russia and Germany in March 1918, then the  Allied  armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. On 18 November 1918, in Riga, the  People's Council of Latvia  proclaimed the independence of the new country, with  K\u0101rlis Ulmanis  becoming the head of the  provisional government . [ citation needed ] \n The  war of independence  that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments\u2014Ulmanis's government; the  Latvian Soviet government  led by  P\u0113teris Stu\u010dka , whose forces, supported by the  Red Army , occupied almost all of the country; and the  Baltic German  government of the  United Baltic Duchy , headed by  Andrievs Niedra  and supported by the  Baltische Landeswehr  and the German  Freikorps  unit  Iron Division . [ citation needed ] \n Estonian and Latvian forces [ citation needed ]  defeated the Germans at the  Battle of Wenden  in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly German force\u2014the  West Russian Volunteer Army \u2014under  Pavel Bermondt-Avalov  was repelled in November. Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the  Battle of Daugavpils  was a part of the  Polish\u2013Soviet War ). [ citation needed ] \n A freely elected  Constituent assembly  convened on 1 May 1920, and adopted a liberal constitution, the  Satversme , in February 1922. [42]  The constitution was partly suspended by K\u0101rlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical  land reform  was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%. [43] \n By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level. Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the  Great Depression . Latvia showed signs of economic recovery, and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period. [ citation needed ]  On 15 May 1934, Ulmanis staged a bloodless  coup , establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940. [44]  After 1934, Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of \"Latvianising\" the economy.

The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet \" spheres of influence \". [46]  In the north, Latvia,  Finland  and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. [46]  A week later, on 1 September 1939, Germany and on 17 September, the Soviet Union  invaded Poland . [47] : 32 \n After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, most of the  Baltic Germans  left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis' government and Nazi Germany under the  Heim ins Reich  programme. [48]  In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939, with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia. [48]  Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940, when a second resettlement scheme was agreed. [49]  The racially approved being resettled mainly in Poland, being given land and businesses in exchange for the money they had received from the sale of their previous assets. [47] : 46 \nRailcars with Latvians to be deported to the East during the  June deportation  of 1941 \n On 5 October 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a \"mutual assistance\" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory. [50]  State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres. [51]  Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted. [51]  Latvia, then a puppet government, was headed by  Augusts Kirhen\u0161teins . [52]  The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as The  Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic . \nGerman soldiers enter Riga, July 1941 \n The Soviets dealt harshly with their  opponents \u00a0\u2013 prior to  Operation Barbarossa , in less than a year, at least 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed. [53]  Most were deported to Siberia where deaths were estimated at 40 percent, officers of the Latvian army being shot on the spot. [47] : 48 \n On 22 June 1941 German troops attacked Soviet forces in Operation Barbarossa. There were some spontaneous uprisings by Latvians against the Red Army which helped the Germans. By 29 June  Riga  was reached and with Soviet troops killed, captured or retreating, Latvia was left under the control of German forces by early July. [47] : 78\u201396  The occupation was followed immediately by SS  Einsatzgruppen  troops who were to act in accordance with the Nazi  Generalplan Ost  which required the population of Latvia to be cut by 50 percent. [47] : 64 [47] : 56 \n Under German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of  Reichskommissariat Ostland . Latvian paramilitary and  Auxiliary Police  units established by the occupation authority participated in  the Holocaust  and other atrocities. [44]  30,000 Jews were shot in Latvia in the autumn of 1941. [47] : 127  Another 30,000 Jews from the Riga ghetto were killed in the Rumbula Forest in November and December 1941, to reduce overpopulating in the ghetto and make room for more Jews being brought in from Germany and the West. [47] : 128  There was a pause in fighting, apart from partisan activity, until after the  siege of Leningrad  ended in January 1944 and the Soviet troops advanced, entering Latvia in July and eventually capturing Riga on 13 October 1944. [47] : 271 \n More than 200,000 Latvian citizens died during World War II, including approximately 75,000 Latvian  Jews  murdered during the Nazi occupation. [44]  Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict, mainly on the German side, with 140,000 men in the  Latvian Legion  of the  Waffen-SS , [54]  The  308th Latvian Rifle Division  was formed by the Red Army in 1944. On occasions, especially in 1944, opposing Latvian troops faced each other in battle. [47] : 299  Activity reaching a peak in late 1946.

In the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's \"live resources\". In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control. The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and  Latvian national partisans , soon joined by German collaborators, began to fight against the new occupier. [55] \n Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden. [56]  Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving Latvia, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war, [57]  returned by the West. [58]  The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944\u201345, and further deportations followed as the country was  collectivised  and  Sovieticised . [44] \n On 25 March 1949, 43,000 rural residents (\" kulaks \") and Latvian patriots (\"nationalists\") were deported to Siberia in a sweeping  Operation Priboi  in all three  Baltic states , which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949. [59]  This operation had the desired effect of reducing the anti Soviet partisan activity. [47] : 326  Between 136,000 and 190,000 Latvians, depending on the sources, were imprisoned or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the  Gulag ) in the post war years, from 1945 to 1952. [60]  Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans. [ citation needed ] \nReconstruction of a  Gulag  shack in the  Museum of the Occupation of Latvia , Riga \n In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into  collectivisation . [61]  An extensive programme to impose  bilingualism  was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belarusian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian. [62]  An influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%. [63] \n Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major  machinery factory RAF  in  Jelgava , electrotechnical factories in  Riga , chemical factories in  Daugavpils ,  Valmiera  and  Olaine \u2014and some food and oil processing plants. [64]  Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories. [ citation needed ]  To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic. [65]  Population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people. \n Restoration of Independence in 1991 [ edit ] \n Further information:  Singing Revolution ,  Baltic Way , and  On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia \n In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader  Mikhail Gorbachev  started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called  glasnost  and  perestroika . In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the  Freedom Monument \u2014a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the  Popular Front of Latvia , was opposed by the  Interfront . The Latvian SSR, along with the other  Baltic Republics  was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war  Flag of Latvia  flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990. [ citation needed ] \n In 1989, the  Supreme Soviet of the USSR  adopted a resolution on the  Occupation of the Baltic states , in which it declared the occupation \"not in accordance with law\", and not the \"will of the Soviet people\". Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the  Supreme Council  in the  March 1990 democratic elections . On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Council adopted the  Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia , and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia. [66] \n However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia. [66] \n In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum. [ citation needed ]  The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship, and that helped sway a large number of ethnic Russians to vote for independence. However, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of Latvia at the day of loss of independence at 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of Latvia, becoming  non-citizens  or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship. Still, today there are 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represent 14.1% of population. They have  no citizenship of any country , and cannot vote in Latvia. [67] \n The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed  Soviet coup attempt . [3] \nLatvia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the  Lisbon Treaty  in 2007. \n The  Saeima , Latvia's parliament, was again elected in 1993. Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the  Skrunda-1  radar station in 1998. The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join  NATO  and the  European Union , were achieved in 2004. The  NATO Summit 2006  was held in Riga. [68] \n Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many  Russophones .  Citizenship  was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation, or to their offspring. Children born to non-nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship. Approximately 72% of Latvian citizens are Latvian, while 20% are Russian; less than 1% of non-citizens are Latvian, while 71% are Russian. [69]  The government denationalised private property confiscated by the Soviets, returning it or compensating the owners for it, and  privatised  most state-owned industries, reintroducing the  prewar currency . Albeit having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal economy and its re-orientation toward Western Europe, Latvia is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union. In 2014,  Riga  was the  European Capital of Culture , the  euro  was introduced as the currency of the country and a Latvian was named vice-president of the  European Commission . In 2015 Latvia held the presidency of  Council of the European Union . Big European events have been celebrated in  Riga  such as the  Eurovision Song Contest 2003  and the  European Film Awards 2014 . On 1 July 2016, Latvia became a member of the OECD.

[74] \n Climate [ edit ] \n \u00a0 \u00a0Humid continental climate warm summer subtype \n \u00a0 \u00a0Oceanic climate \n Latvia has a  temperate  climate that has been described in various sources as either  humid continental  ( K\u00f6ppen  Dfb ) or  oceanic/maritime  (K\u00f6ppen  Cfb ). [75] [76] [77] \n Coastal regions, especially the western coast of  Courland Peninsula , possess a more maritime climate with cooler summers and milder winters, while eastern parts exhibit a more continental climate with warmer summers and harsher winters. [75] \n Latvia has four pronounced seasons of near-equal length. Winter starts in mid-December and lasts until mid-March. Winters have average temperatures of \u22126\u00a0\u00b0C (21\u00a0\u00b0F) and are characterized by stable snow cover, bright sunshine, and short days. Severe spells of winter weather with cold winds, extreme temperatures of around \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0F) and heavy snowfalls are common. Summer starts in June and lasts until August. Summers are usually warm and sunny, with cool evenings and nights. Summers have average temperatures of around 19\u00a0\u00b0C (66\u00a0\u00b0F), with extremes of 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). Spring and autumn bring fairly mild weather.

In a typical Latvian landscape, a mosaic of vast forests alternates with fields, farmsteads, and pastures. Arable land is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals. Latvia has hundreds of kilometres of undeveloped seashore\u2014lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches. [74] [80] \n Latvia has the 5th highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union, after Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Slovenia. [81]  Forests account for 3,497,000\u00a0ha (8,640,000 acres) or 56% of the total land area. [72] \n Latvia has over 12,500 rivers, which stretch for 38,000\u00a0km (24,000\u00a0mi). Major rivers include the  Daugava River ,  Lielupe ,  Gauja ,  Venta , and  Salaca , the largest spawning ground for  salmon  in the eastern Baltics. There are 2,256 lakes that are bigger than 1\u00a0ha (2.5 acres), with a collective area of 1,000\u00a0km 2  (390\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).  Mires  occupy 9.9% of Latvia's territory. Of these, 42% are raised bogs; 49% are fens; and 9% are transitional mires. 70% percent of the mires are untouched by civilisation, and they are a refuge for many rare species of plants and animals. [80] \n Agricultural areas account for 1,815,900\u00a0ha (4,487,000 acres) or 29% of the total land area. [71]  With the dismantling of collective farms, the area devoted to farming decreased dramatically \u2013 now farms are predominantly small. Approximately 200 farms, occupying 2,750\u00a0ha (6,800 acres), are engaged in ecologically pure farming (using no artificial fertilisers or pesticides). [80] \n Latvia's  national parks  are  Gauja National Park  in  Vidzeme  (since 1973) [82] ,  \u0136emeri National Park  in  Zemgale  (1997),  Sl\u012btere National Park  in  Kurzeme  (1999), and  R\u0101zna National Park  in  Latgale  (2007). [ citation needed ] \n Latvia has a long tradition of conservation. The first laws and regulations were promulgated in the 16th and 17th centuries. [80]  There are 706 specially state-level protected natural areas in Latvia: four national parks, one biosphere reserve, 42 nature parks, nine areas of protected landscapes, 260 nature reserves, four strict nature reserves, 355 nature monuments, seven protected marine areas and 24 microreserves. [83]  Nationally protected areas account for 12,790\u00a0km 2  (4,940\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) or around 20% of Latvia's total land area. [73]  Latvia's Red Book (Endangered Species List of Latvia), which was established in 1977, contains 112 plant species and 119 animal species. Latvia has ratified the international Washington, Bern, and Ramsare conventions. [80] \n The 2012  Environmental Performance Index  ranks Latvia second, after  Switzerland , based on the environmental performance of the country's policies. [84] \n Venta Rapid  in  Kuld\u012bga  is the widest waterfall in Europe and a natural monument of Latvia. \n Devonian  sandstone cliffs in  Gauja National Park , Latvia's largest and oldest national park \n \u0136emeri National Park  is home to mires, natural mineral-springs, muds and lakes that are former lagoons of the  Littorina Sea . \n Sl\u012btere National Park  at  Cape Kolka  includes several  Livonian  fishing villages of the  Livonian Coast . ( Livonian :  L\u012bv\u00f5d R\u0101nda ) \n Biodiversity [ edit ] \nThe  white wagtail  is the national bird of Latvia. [85] \n Approximately 30,000 species of flora and fauna have been registered in Latvia. [86]  Common species of wildlife in Latvia include  deer ,  wild boar ,  moose ,  lynx ,  bear ,  fox ,  beaver  and  wolves . [87]   Non-marine molluscs of Latvia  include 159 species. [ citation needed ] \n Species that are endangered in other European countries but common in Latvia include: black stork ( Ciconia nigra ), corncrake ( Crex crex ), lesser spotted eagle ( Aquila pomarina ), white-backed woodpecker ( Picoides leucotos ), Eurasian crane ( Grus grus ), Eurasian beaver ( Castor fiber ), Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ), European wolf ( Canis lupus ) and European lynx ( Felis lynx ). [80] \n Phytogeographically , Latvia is shared between the Central European and Northern European provinces of the  Circumboreal Region  within the  Boreal Kingdom . According to the  WWF , the territory of Latvia belongs to the  ecoregion  of  Sarmatic mixed forests . 56 percent [72]  of Latvia's territory is covered by forests, mostly  Scots pine ,  birch , and  Norway spruce . [ citation needed ] \n Several species of flora and fauna are considered national symbols.  Oak  ( Quercus robur ,  Latvian :  ozols ), and  linden  ( Tilia cordata ,  Latvian :  liepa ) are Latvia's national trees and the  daisy  ( Leucanthemum vulgare ,  Latvian :  p\u012bpene ) its national flower. The white wagtail ( Motacilla alba ,  Latvian :  balt\u0101 cielava ) is Latvia's national bird. Its national insect is the  two-spot ladybird  ( Adalia bipunctata ,  Latvian :  divpunktu m\u0101r\u012bte ).  Amber , fossilized tree resin, is one of Latvia's most important cultural symbols. In ancient times, amber found along the Baltic Sea coast was sought by Vikings as well as traders from Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire. This led to the development of the  Amber Road . [88] \n Several nature reserves protect unspoiled landscapes with a variety of large animals. At  Pape Nature Reserve , where  European bison , wild horses, and  recreated aurochs  have been reintroduced, there is now an almost complete  Holocene   megafauna  also including moose, deer, and wolf. [89] \n Administrative divisions [ edit ] \nHistorical regions: orange  Courland , green  Semigallia , brown  Selonia , yellow  Vidzeme , blue  Latgale \nAdministrative divisions of Latvia \n Main article:  Administrative divisions of Latvia \n See also:  List of cities in Latvia ,  Planning regions of Latvia ,  Statistical regions of Latvia , and  Historical regions of Latvia \n Latvia is a  unitary state , currently divided into 110 one-level municipalities ( Latvian :  novadi ) and 9 republican cities ( Latvian :  republikas pils\u0113tas ) with their own city council and administration:  Daugavpils ,  J\u0113kabpils ,  Jelgava ,  J\u016brmala ,  Liep\u0101ja ,  R\u0113zekne ,  Riga ,  Valmiera , and  Ventspils . There are four  historical and cultural regions in Latvia \u00a0\u2013  Courland ,  Latgale ,  Vidzeme ,  Zemgale , which are recognised in  Constitution of Latvia .  Selonia , a part of Zemgale, is sometimes considered culturally distinct region, but it is not part of any formal division. The borders of historical and cultural regions usually are not explicitly defined and in several sources may vary. In formal divisions, Riga region, which includes the capital and parts of other regions that have a strong relationship with the capital, is also often included in regional divisions; e.g., there are five  planning regions of Latvia  ( Latvian :  pl\u0101no\u0161anas re\u0123ioni ), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions. Under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland, and Zemgale.  Statistical regions of Latvia , established in accordance with the EU  Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics , duplicate this division, but divides Riga region into two parts with the capital alone being a separate region.

[126]  Latvian armed forces contributed to a UK-led  Battlegroup  in 2013 and the  Nordic Battlegroup  in 2015 under the  Common Security and Defence Policy  (CSDP) of the European Union. [127]  Latvia acts as the lead nation in the coordination of the  Northern Distribution Network  for transportation of non-lethal  ISAF  cargo by air and rail to Afghanistan. [128] [129] [130]  It is part of the Nordic Transition Support Unit (NTSU), which renders joint force contributions in support of Afghan security structures ahead of the withdrawal of Nordic and Baltic ISAF forces in 2014. [131]  Since 1996 more than 3600 military personnel have participated in international operations, [123]  of whom 7 soldiers perished. [132]  Per capita, Latvia is one of the largest contributors to international military operations. [133] \n Latvian civilian experts have contributed to EU civilian missions: border assistance mission to Moldova and Ukraine (2005\u20132009), rule of law missions in Iraq (2006 and 2007) and Kosovo (since 2008), police mission in Afghanistan (since 2007) and monitoring mission in Georgia (since 2008). [122] \n Since March 2004, when the  Baltic states  joined NATO, fighter jets of NATO members have been deployed on a rotational basis for the  Baltic Air Policing  mission at  \u0160iauliai Airport  in Lithuania to guard the Baltic airspace. Latvia participates in several  NATO Centres of Excellence : Civil-Military Co-operation in the Netherlands,  Cooperative Cyber Defence  in Estonia and Energy Security in Lithuania. It plans to establish the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence in Riga. [134] \n Latvia co-operates with Estonia and Lithuania in several trilateral Baltic defence co-operation initiatives: \n Baltic Battalion  (BALTBAT) \u00a0\u2013 infantry battalion for participation in international peace support operations, headquartered near  Riga , Latvia; \n Baltic Naval Squadron   (BALTRON) \u00a0\u2013 naval force with mine countermeasures capabilities, headquartered near  Tallinn ,  Estonia ; \n Baltic Air Surveillance Network   (BALTNET) \u00a0\u2013 air surveillance information system, headquartered near  Kaunas ,  Lithuania ; \n Joint military educational institutions:  Baltic Defence College  in  Tartu ,  Estonia , Baltic Diving Training Centre in  Liep\u0101ja , Latvia and Baltic Naval Communications Training Centre in  Tallinn , Estonia. [135] \n Future co-operation will include sharing of national infrastructures for training purposes and specialisation of training areas  (BALTTRAIN)  and collective formation of battalion-sized contingents for use in the NATO rapid-response force. [136]  In January 2011, the Baltic states were invited to join  NORDEFCO , the defence framework of the  Nordic countries . [137]  In November 2012, the three countries agreed to create a joint military staff in 2013. [138] \n Economy [ edit ] \n Main article:  Economy of Latvia \nLatvia is part of the  EU single market  (dark grey),  Eurozone  (dark blue) and  Schengen Area  (not shown). \n Latvia is a member of the  World Trade Organisation  (1999) and the  European Union  (2004). On 1 January 2014, the  Euro  became the country's currency, superseding the  Lats . According to statistics in late 2013, 45% of the population supported the introduction of the euro, while 52% opposed it. [139]  Following the introduction of the Euro, Eurobarometer surveys in January 2014 showed support for the Euro to be around 53%, close to the European average. [140] \n Since the year 2000, Latvia has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in Europe. [141]  However, the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009, exacerbated by the global economic crisis, shortage of credit and huge money resources used for the bailout of Parex bank. [142]  The Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009, the biggest fall in the European Union. [143] [144] \nReal GDP growth in Latvia 1996\u20132006 \n The economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast-growing economy was heading for implosion of the  economic bubble , because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic  consumption , financed by a serious increase of private  debt , as well as a negative foreign  trade balance . The prices of real estate, which were at some points growing by approximately 5% a month, were long perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low-value goods and  raw materials . [ citation needed ] \n Privatisation  in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been privatised, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. The private sector accounted for nearly 68% of the country's GDP in 2000. [ citation needed ] \n Foreign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the same year, the United States of America exported $58.2 million of goods and services to Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions like the  World Trade Organisation ,  OECD , and the  European Union , Latvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995\u2014with a 4-year transition period. Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation. [ citation needed ] \n Economic contraction and recovery (2008\u201312) [ edit ] \n Main article:  2008\u20132010 Latvian financial crisis \nAn  airBaltic  Boeing 757\u2212200WL takes off at  Riga International Airport  (RIX) \n The Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values. The national account deficit for 2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10%. [145] \n Latvia's unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22%. [146]  In April 2010 Latvia had the highest unemployment rate in the EU, at 22.5%, ahead of Spain, which had 19.7%. [147] \n Paul Krugman , the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his  New York Times  Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008: \n \"The most acute problems are on Europe's periphery, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia: Latvia is the new Argentina \" [148] \n However, by 2010, commentators [149] [150]  noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy. Rating agency  Standard & Poor's  raised its outlook on Latvia's debt from negative to stable. [149]  Latvia's current account, which had been in deficit by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010. [149]  Kenneth Orchard, senior analyst at  Moody's Investors Service  argued that: \n \"The strengthening regional economy is supporting Latvian production and exports, while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the country's \u2018internal devaluation\u2019 is working.\" [151] \n The  IMF  concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvia's economy has been recovering strongly since 2010, following the deep downturn in 2008\u201309. Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand. The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions, and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014. The unemployment rate has receded from its peak of more than 20 percent in 2010 to around 9.3 percent in 2014. [152] \n Infrastructure [ edit ] \nThe  Port of Ventspils  is one of the busiest ports in the  Baltic states . \n Main article:  Transport in Latvia \n The transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan as well as other Asian countries and the West is large. [153] \n The three biggest ports of Latvia are located in  Riga ,  Ventspils , and  Liep\u0101ja . Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products. [153]   Free port of Ventspils  is one of the busiest ports in the  Baltic states . Apart from road and railway connections, Ventspils is also linked to oil extraction fields and transportation routes of Russian Federation via system of two pipelines from  Polotsk , Belarus. [ citation needed ] \n Riga International Airport  is the busiest airport in the  Baltic states  with 4.7 million passengers in 2012. It has direct flight to over 80 destinations in 30 countries.  airBaltic  is the Latvian flag carrier airline and a low-cost carrier. [ citation needed ] \n Latvia has three big hydroelectric power stations in  P\u013cavi\u0146u HES  (825MW),  R\u012bgas HES  (402 MW) and  \u0136eguma HES-2  (192 MW). In the recent years a couple of dozen of wind farms as well as biogas or biomass power stations of different scale have been built in Latvia. [ citation needed ] \n Latvia operates  In\u010dukalns underground gas storage facility , one of the largest  underground gas storage facilities  in Europe and the only one in the Baltic states. Unique geological conditions at In\u010dukalns and other locations in Latvia are particularly suitable for underground gas storage. [154] \n Demographics [ edit ] \n Main article:  Demographics of Latvia \n Residents of Latvia by ethnicity (2011) [1] \n Latvians \n \u2009 \n 62.1% \n Russians \n \u2009 \n 26.9% \n Belarusians \n \u2009 \n 3.3% \n Ukrainians \n \u2009 \n 2.2% \n Poles \n \u2009 \n 2.2% \n Lithuanians \n \u2009 \n 1.2% \n Others \n \u2009 \n 2.1% \nPopulation of Latvia (in millions) from 1920 to 2014 \n The  total fertility rate  (TFR) in 2013 was estimated at 1.52 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2012, 45.0% of births were to unmarried women. [155]  The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.19 years (68.13 years male, 78.53 years female). [145]  As of 2015, Latvia is estimated to have the lowest male-to-female ratio in total population, at 0.85 males/female. [156] \n Ethnic groups [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Latvian people ,  Latvian Russians ,  Latvian Germans ,  Latvian Jews ,  Latgalians (modern) , and  Livonians \n Latvia's population has been  multiethnic  for centuries, though the demographics shifted dramatically in the 20th century due to the World Wars, the emigration and removal of  Baltic Germans ,  the Holocaust , and occupation by the  Soviet Union . According to the  Russian Empire Census  of 1897, Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, Germans for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%. [157] \n As of March 2011,  Latvians  form about 62.1% of the population, while 26.9% are  Russians ,  Belarusians  3.3%,  Ukrainians  2.2%,  Poles  2.2%,  Lithuanians  1.2%,  Jews  0.3%,  Romani people  0.3%,  Germans  0.1%,  Estonians  0.1% and others 1.3%. 250 people identify as  Livonians  ( Baltic Finnic  people native to Latvia). There were 290,660  non-citizens  living in Latvia or 14.1% of Latvian residents, mainly ethnic Russians who arrived after the occupation of 1940 and their descendants. [158] \n In some cities, e.g.,  Daugavpils  and  R\u0113zekne , ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population. Despite the fact that the proportion of ethnic Latvians has been steadily increasing for more than a decade, ethnic Latvians also make up slightly less than a half of the population of the capital city of Latvia \u2013  R\u012bga . [159] \n The share of ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989. [160]  In 2011, there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989, though their share of the population was larger\u00a0\u2013 1,285,136 (62.1% of the population). [161] \n Language [ edit ] \n Further information:  Language policy in Latvia \n The sole official language of Latvia is  Latvian , which belongs to the  Baltic language sub-group  of the  Balto-Slavic branch  of the  Indo-European language family . Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct  Livonian language  of the  Finnic  branch of the  Uralic language family , which enjoys protection by law;  Latgalian \u00a0\u2013 referred to as either a dialect or a distinct separate language of Latvian\u00a0\u2013 is also formally protected by Latvian law but only as a historical variation of the Latvian language. Russian, which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, is still the most widely used minority language by far (about 34% speak it at home, including people who are not ethnically Russian). [162]  While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian, most schools also include English and either German or Russian in their curricula. English is widely accepted in Latvia, especially in business and tourism. As of 2014 [update]  there are 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction for 40% of subjects (the rest 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian). \n On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a  constitutional referendum  on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language. [163]  According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%. [164] \n Religion [ edit ] \n Main article:  Religion in Latvia \n Religion in Latvia (2011) [165] \n Lutheranism \n \u2009 \n 34.2% \n Roman Catholicism \n \u2009 \n 24.1% \n Russian Orthodox \n \u2009 \n 17.8% \n Old Believers \n \u2009 \n 1.6% \n Other Christian \n \u2009 \n 1.2% \n Other or  none \n \u2009 \n 21.1% \n Riga Cathedral \n The largest religion in Latvia is  Christianity  (79%), [145] [165]  The largest groups as of 2011 [update]  were: \n Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia \u00a0\u2013 708,773 [165] \n Roman Catholic \u00a0\u2013 500,000 [165] \n Russian Orthodox \u00a0\u2013 370,000 [165] \n In the  Eurobarometer Poll  2010, 38% of Latvian citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", while 48% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 11% stated that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force\". \n Lutheranism was more prominent before the Soviet occupation, when it was a majority religion of ~60% due to strong historical links with the  Nordic countries  and influence of the  Hansa , and  Germany  in general. Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a slightly greater extent than Roman Catholicism in all three  Baltic states . The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of 18 March 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in Latvia, but the faith has since experienced a revival. [166]  The country's Orthodox Christians belong to the  Latvian Orthodox Church , a semi-autonomous body within the  Russian Orthodox Church . In 2011, there were 416  Jews  and 319  Muslims  living in Latvia. [165] \n There are more than 600 Latvian  neopagans ,  Dievturi  (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on  Latvian mythology . [167]  About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion. [165] \n Education and science [ edit ] \n Main article:  Education in Latvia \n See also:  List of universities in Latvia \n University of Latvia \n Riga Technical University  and  University of Latvia  are two major universities in the country, both established on the basis of Riga Polytechnical Institute and located in  Riga . [168]  Another two important universities, which were established on the base of State University of Latvia, are  Latvia University of Agriculture  (established in 1939 on the basis of the Faculty of Agriculture) and  Riga Stradi\u0146\u0161 University  (established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine)\u00a0\u2013 both nowadays cover a variety of different fields.  Daugavpils University  is another significant centre of education. Latvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010, which is a 12.9% decline, and in the same period enrolment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people, a 10.3% decline. [169] \n The Latvian policy of science and technology set out the long term goal \u2013 transition from labor-consuming economy to knowledge-based economy. [170]  By 2020 the government aims at a 1.5% GDP funding for research and development, with half of the investments coming from the private sector. Latvia develop their scientific potential on the basis of the existing scientific traditions, particularly in organic chemistry, medical chemistry, genetic engineering, physics, materials science and information technologies. [171]  The highest number of inventions, which are patented both nationwide and abroad, are made in the branch of medical chemistry. [172] \n Health [ edit ] \n Main article:  Health in Latvia \n The Latvian healthcare system is a  universal programme , largely funded through government taxation. [173]  It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors. [174]  There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006. [175] [176] [177] \n Culture [ edit ] \n Main article:  Culture of Latvia \nChoirs performing during the 24th  Latvian Song and Dance Festival  in 2008 \n Traditional Latvian  folklore , especially the dance of the  folk songs , date back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified. [178] \n Between the 13th and 19th centuries,  Baltic Germans , many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into  German culture , formed the upper class. [ citation needed ]  They developed distinct cultural heritage, characterised by both Latvian and German influences. It has survived in German Baltic families to this day, in spite of their dispersal to Germany, the United States, Canada and other countries in the early 20th century. However, most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life. [ citation needed ]  Thus, the mostly peasant local  pagan  heritage was preserved, partly merging with Christian traditions. For example, one of the most popular celebrations is  J\u0101\u0146i , a pagan celebration of the  summer solstice \u2014which Latvians celebrate on the feast day of St.  John the Baptist . [ citation needed ] \n Historic Centre of Riga  was declared  World Heritage Site  by  UNESCO  in 1997. \n In the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements emerged. They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities. The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded by Latvians as a classical era of Latvian culture. Posters show the influence of other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist  Bernhard Borchert  and the French  Raoul Dufy . [ citation needed ]  With the onset of World War II, many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely for a Latvian \u00e9migr\u00e9 audience. [179] \n Latvian Song and Dance Festival  is an important event in  Latvian  culture and social life. It has been held since 1873, normally every five years. Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event. [180]  Although usually folksongs and classical choir songs are sung, with emphasis on  a cappella  singing, recently modern popular songs have been incorporated into the repertoire, as well. [ citation needed ] \n After incorporation into the  Soviet Union , Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the  Socialist realism  style of art. During the Soviet era, music became increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the 1980s. At this time, songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity. This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry. Since independence, theatre,  scenography ,  choir music , and classical music have become the most notable branches of Latvian culture. [ citation needed ] \n During July 2014,  Riga  hosted the 8th  World Choir Games  as it played host to over 27,000 choristers representing over 450 choirs and over 70 countries. The festival is the biggest of its kind in the world and is held every two years in a different host city. [181] \n Cuisine [ edit ] \n Main article:  Latvian cuisine \n Latvian cuisine typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes. Fish is commonly consumed due to Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea. Latvian cuisine has been influenced by the neighbouring countries. Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as potatoes, wheat, barley, cabbage, onions, eggs, and pork. Latvian food is generally quite fatty, and uses few spices. [182] [ citation needed ] \n Grey peas and ham are generally considered as staple foods of Latvians.  Sorrel soup  is also consumed by Latvians. [183]   Rupjmaize  is a dark bread made from rye, considered the national  staple . [184] [ citation needed ] \n Sport [ edit ] \n Main article:  Sport in Latvia \n Arena Riga  during the  2006 IIHF World Championship \n Ice hockey is usually considered the most popular sport in Latvia. Latvia has had many famous hockey stars like  Helmut Balderis ,  Art\u016brs Irbe ,  K\u0101rlis Skrasti\u0146\u0161  and  Sandis Ozoli\u0146\u0161  and more recently  Zemgus Girgensons , who the Latvian people have strongly supported in international and NHL play, expressed through the dedication of using the NHL's All Star Voting to bring Zemgus to number one in voting. [185]   Dinamo Riga  is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the  Kontinental Hockey League . The national tournament is the  Latvian Hockey Higher League , held since 1931. The  2006 IIHF World Championship  was held in Riga. \n Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is \n The second most popular sport is basketball. Latvia has a long basketball tradition, as the  Latvian national basketball team  won the first ever  EuroBasket  in  1935  and silver medals in  1939 , after losing the final to  Lithuania  by one point. Latvia has had many European basketball stars like  J\u0101nis Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161 ,  Maigonis Valdmanis ,  Valdis Mui\u017enieks ,  Valdis Valters ,  Igors Miglinieks , as well as the first Latvian  NBA  player  Gundars V\u0113tra .  Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161  is one of the most well-known Latvian basketball players, who played in the  NBA  for the  Golden State Warriors  and the  Utah Jazz . Current  NBA  players include  Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is , who plays for the  New York Knicks , and  D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns , who plays for the  San Antonio Spurs . Former Latvian basketball club  ASK Riga  won the  Euroleague  tournament three times in a row before being defunct. Currently,  VEF R\u012bga , which competes in  EuroCup , is the strongest professional basketball club in Latvia.  BK Ventspils , which participates in  EuroChallenge , is the second strongest basketball club in Latvia, previously winning  LBL  eight times and  BBL  in 2013. [ citation needed ]  Latvia was one of the  EuroBasket 2015  hosts. \n Other popular sports include  football ,  floorball , tennis, volleyball, cycling,  bobsleigh  and  skeleton . The  Latvian national football team 's only major  FIFA  tournament participation has been the  2004 UEFA European Championship . [186] \n Latvia  has participated successfully in both  Winter  and  Summer Olympics . The most successful Olympic athlete in the history of independent Latvia has been  M\u0101ris \u0160trombergs , who became a two-time Olympic champion in 2008 and 2012 at Men's BMX.
