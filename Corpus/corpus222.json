You can also use Google's advanced search operators to perform a search for a word or phrase on all of the pages of a specific site. You can use this in conjunction with the Find tool to locate a word anywhere on the internet. \n Steps Edit \n Method One of Two: Searching on an Open Page Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/42\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/42\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Press  . Ctrl + F   (Windows) or   \u2318  Command + F   (Mac).  This will open the \"Find\" box in virtually any browser. This command can also be found in the Edit menu in Internet Explorer, or in the \u2630 menu in Chrome and Firefox.\n If you're using a mobile browser, the Find command is usually in the browser's menu. It may be called \"Find in Page\". \n If you are using Safari for iOS, delete the address that is in the address bar and type the word you want to search for there instead. Select \"On this page\" from the search results that appear.

Your browser will find matches as you type. Letter case is ignored when using the Find tool.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-459px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-759px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-3-Version-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":344.36813186813,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":568.95604395604} \n 3 \n Cycle through the matches.  Click the Next and Previous buttons in the Find box to cycle though the search results. The page will jump to each one, and the results will be highlighted.

You can use Google to perform searches of all of the pages on a website. This can help you find matching words on large or complex websites.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-760px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 2 \n Enter  . site: siteaddress.com   at the front of the search.  This will tell Google to only search through pages on that site.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/04\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-459px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/04\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-759px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":344.36813186813,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":568.95604395604} \n 3 \n Enter the word or phrase you want to search for after the site address.  You can enter a single word, or you can enter phrases. To have Google look for an exact word or phrase, surround it with quotes. [3] \n For example, to search wikiHow for any page that has the word \"banana\", you would type  site:wikihow.com banana . To search wikiHow for any page that has the phrase \"eat a banana\", you would type  site:wikihow.com \"eat a banana\" . \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/96\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-7.jpg\\/v4-460px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-7.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/96\\/Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-7.jpg\\/v4-760px-Search-for-a-Word-on-a-Webpage-Step-7.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Open a page from the search results and use the Find command.  Google will return any pages that match your search, but it won't point you to the matching text once you open the page. You'll need to use the Find tool to jump to where the word occurs on the page.\n See the previous section for information on using the Find tool. \n Advertisement \n Community Q&A \n Search \n Add New Question \n Ask a Question \n 200 characters left \n Submit \n Video Edit \n Related wikiHows Edit \n How to  Put a Word Document on Your Website \n How to  Make a Website With Word \n How to  Search Google \n How to  Clear Your Browser's Cache \n How to  Download Any Video from Any Website for Free \n How to  Enable Cookies in Your Internet Web Browser \n How to  Disable Popup Blockers \n How to  Clear Cache and Cookies \n How to  Get the Android Browser to Block Popups \n How to  View Browsing History \n Advertisement \n About This Article \n How helpful is this? \n\t\t\t\tCo-authors:   7 \n Updated:  \n\t\t\t\tViews:\u00a0 329,436 \n\t\t\t\tCategories:  Internet Browsers \n Sources and Attribution \n Is this article up to date? \n Yes \n No \n\t\t\t\tNo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{{questionText}}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{{currentMethod}}\n\t\t\t\t\t{{cheerText}}\n\t\t\t\t\t{{oopsText}}\n\t\t\t\tYes\n Share \n Searching on an Open Page Searching a Site with Google Community Q&A Video Related wikiHows \n Surprise Me! \n 178"}
