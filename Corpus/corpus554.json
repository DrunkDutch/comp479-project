They reigned\n                altogether in Britain four hundred and seventy\n                winters since Gaius Julius first sought that\n                land. \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n 439 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Leo papa\n                hic sanciuit Calcedonensem sinodum.  \n 443 \n \u00a0 \n This year the British sent\n                men over the sea to Rome, and asked for help\n                against the Picts, but they never had it, because\n                they were on an expedition against King Attila\n                the Hun. They sent then to the Angles, and the\n                Anglian \ufffdthelings, with the same request. \n [ Hand 8: Her  sendon [6]   Brytwalas to Rome 7 heom\n                fultomes b\ufffddon wi\ufffd Pi o htas,\n                ac hi \ufffdar n\ufffdfdan nanne, for\ufffdan \ufffde hi fyrdedon\n                wi\ufffd \ufffdtla [7]  Huna cyning\ufffd, 7 \ufffda\n                sendon hi to Anglum 7 Angelcynnes \ufffd\ufffdelingas\n                \ufffd\ufffds ylcan b\ufffddan.  ]  \n Her sendon\n                Brytwalas ofer  s\ufffd  to Rome 7 heom\n                fultumes b\ufffddon wi\ufffd Peohtas, ac hi \ufffd\ufffdr nefdon\n                n\ufffdnne, for\ufffdan \ufffde hi feordodan wi\ufffd \ufffdtlan Huna\n                cininge, 7 \ufffda sendon hi to Anglum 7 Angelcynnes\n                \ufffd\ufffdelingas \ufffdes ilcan b\ufffddon.  \n 444 \n \u00a0 \n This year died St. Martin.  \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n 448 \n \u00a0 \n This year John the Baptist\n                showed his head to two monks who had come from\n                eastern parts to pray at Jerusalem, in the place\n                that, for a time, had been Herod's home [8] . \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n 449 \n \u00a0 \n This year Martianus and\n                Valentinian recieved the kingdom and reigned for\n                seven years. In their days the Angles were\n                invited here by King  Vortigern , and they came to Britain\n                in three longships, landing at Ebbesfleet. King  Vortigern  gave them territory in the\n                south-east of this land, on the condition that\n                they fight the Picts. This they did, and had\n                victory wherever they went. They then sent to\n                Angel, commanded more aid, and commanded that\n                they should be told of the Britons' worthlessness\n                and the choice nature of their land. They soon\n                sent hither a greater host to help the others.\n                Then came the men of three Germanic tribes: Old\n                Saxons; Angles; and Jutes. Of the Jutes come the\n                people of Kent and the Isle of Wight; that is the\n                tribe which now lives on Wight, and that race\n                among the West Saxons which men even now call\n                Jutish. Of the Old Saxons come the East Saxons,\n                South Saxons, and West Saxons. Of the Angles -\n                the country they left has since stood empty\n                between Jutes and Saxons - come the East\n                Anglians, Middle Anglians, Mercians, and all the\n                Northumbrians. Their war-leaders were two\n                brothers, Hengist and Horsa, who were Wihtgil's\n                sons. First of all, they killed and drove away\n                the king's enemies; then later they turned on the\n                king and the British, destroying through fire and\n                the sword's edge. \n Her  Mauricius [9]  7 Ualentines onfengon rice 7\n                ricsodon .vii. winter. 7 On hiera dagum Hengest 7\n                Horsa from  Wyrtgeorne  gelea\ufffdade Bretta kyninge\n                gesohton Bretene on \ufffdam sta\ufffde \ufffde is genemned\n                Ypwinesfleot, \ufffdrest Brettum to fultume, ac hie\n                eft on hie fuhton.

In his days Gregory sent us\n                baptism - that was in the thirty-second year of\n                his reign - and the priest Columba came to the\n                Picts, and they converted to belief in Christ.\n                Those are the inhabitants of the northern\n                mountains; their king gave him the island men\n                call Iona. There are five hides of land there, it\n                is said; there Columba built a monastery. He was\n                the abbot there for thirty-two years, and there\n                he passed away when he was seventy-seven years\n                old. His heirs even now have that place. The\n                South Picts were baptised long before - bishop\n                Ninian preached baptism to them, who had been\n                taught in Rome; and his church and monastery are\n                at Whithorn, hallowed in St. Martin's name. There\n                he rests with many holy men. Now there must\n                always be on land an abbot rather than a bishop,\n                all the Scottish bishops, because Columba was an\n                abbot, not a bishop. \n Her Columba\n                m\ufffdssepreost of Scottum com in Brettas to\n                l\ufffdrenne Peohtas 7 in Hi \ufffdam ealonde mynster\n                worhte.
