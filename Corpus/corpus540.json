The dominant geographical features of North India are the  Indus-Gangetic Plain  and the  Himalayas , which demarcate the region from the  Tibetan Plateau  and  Central Asia . \n The term North India has varying definitions\u2014the  Ministry of Home Affairs  in its  Northern Zonal Council   Administrative division  included the states of  Haryana ,  Himachal Pradesh ,  Jammu and Kashmir ,  Punjab  and  Rajasthan  and Union Territories of  Delhi ,  Chandigarh . [1] [4]  while the  Ministry of Culture  in its  North  Culture Zone  includes the state of  Uttarakhand  but excludes  Delhi [2]  whereas the  Geological Survey of India  includes  Uttar Pradesh  and  Delhi  but excludes  Rajasthan  and  Chandigarh . [3]  Other states sometimes included are  Bihar ,  Gujarat ,  Madhya Pradesh  and  West Bengal . [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] \n North India has been the historical centre of the  Mughal ,  Delhi Sultanate  and  British Indian  Empires. It has a diverse culture, and includes the  Hindu  pilgrimage centres of  Char Dham ,  Haridwar ,  Varanasi ,  Ayodhya ,  Mathura ,  Allahabad ,  Vaishno Devi  and  Pushkar , the  Buddhist  pilgrimage centres of  Bodhgaya ,  Sarnath  and  Kushinagar , the  Sikh   Golden Temple  as well as world heritage sites such as the  Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve ,  Khajuraho temples ,  Hill Forts of Rajasthan ,  Jantar Mantar (Jaipur) ,  Bhimbetka Caves ,  Sanchi monuments ,  Qutb Minar ,  Red Fort ,  Agra Fort ,  Fatehpur Sikri  and the  Taj Mahal . \n The languages that have official status in one or more of the states and union territories located in North India are  Hindi ,  Urdu ,  Punjabi ,  Kashmiri/Koshur ,  Dogri  and  English .

[1] [4] \n The  Ministry of Culture  established the  North  Culture Zone  in  Patiala ,  Punjab  on 23 March 1985. It differs from the North Zonal Council in its inclusion of  Uttarakhand  and the omission of  Delhi . [2] \n In contrast, the  Geological Survey of India  (part of the  Ministry of Mines ) included  Uttar Pradesh  and  Delhi  in its  Northern Region , but excluded  Rajasthan  and  Chandigarh , with a regional headquarters in  Lucknow . [3] \n Wider definition [ edit ] \n Indian press definition [ edit ] \n The Hindu  newspaper puts Bihar, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh related articles on its  North  pages. [5]  Articles in the Indian press have included the states of Bihar, [6]  Gujarat, [9] [8]  Madhya Pradesh, [7]  and West Bengal [11] [10]  in North India as well. \n Latitude-based definition [ edit ] \n The  Tropic of Cancer , which divides the  temperate zone  from the  tropical zone  in the  Northern Hemisphere , runs through India, and could theoretically be regarded as a geographical dividing line in the country. [13]  Indian states that are entirely above the  Tropic of Cancer  are  Jammu and Kashmir ,  Himachal Pradesh ,  Punjab ,  Haryana ,  Delhi ,  Uttarakhand ,  Uttar Pradesh  and  Bihar  and most of  North East Indian  states. However that definition would also include major parts of  Rajasthan ,  Madhya Pradesh ,  Jharkhand  and  West Bengal  and minor regions of  Chhattisgarh  and  Gujarat . \n Anecdotal usage [ edit ] \n The term \"North Indian\" is sometimes used to describe people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, often using the term  bhaiya  (which literally means 'elder brother') in a derogatory sense, though some press reports have contradicted this. [14]  In Punjab, people from the same region (Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) are often referred to as  Purabias , or Easterners. [15]  The  Government of Bihar  official site places the state in the eastern part of India. [16]  Within Uttar Pradesh itself, \"the cultural divide between the east and the west is considerable, with the  purabiyas  (easterners) often being clubbed with Biharis in the perception of the westerners.\" [17] [18] \n History [ edit ] \n The empires and dynasties that have ruled parts or all of North India include: \n Maurya Empire , 326 \u2013 187 BCE \n Indo-Greek Kingdom , c.150 BCE \u2013 10 CE ( Menander I  conquered Punjab) \n Northern Satraps , 1st century BCE to 1st century CE \n Gupta Empire , during the reign of Samudragupta, c.335 \u2013 c.550 CE \n Empire of Harsha , 606 to 647 CE \n Pala Empire , 770 to 810 CE \n Pratihara Empire , mid-7th to the 11th century \n Delhi Sultanate , 1206\u20131526 \n Mughal Empire , 1526\u20131540, then 1555\u20131857, interrupted briefly by the Sur Empire, \n Sur Empire  1540\u20131556 \n Sikh Empire  1799\u20131849 \n Maratha Empire  1761\u20131818 \n British Indian Empire  1858\u20131947 \n The Delhi Sultanate, Mughal and British Indian Empires had Delhi as their capital for some or all of their rule. \n \"North of the Vindhyas\" [ edit ] \n See also:  Hindi Belt \n One demarcation between northern and southern nations has been the  Vindhya  mountain range. [19]  In centuries past this sometimes formed a border during periods of imperial expansion, such as the one ruled by the  Gupta  emperor  Samudragupta . [20]  The Vindhyas also find mention in the narrative of  Rishi   Agastya  as a dividing feature between North and South India. [21]  The  Manusm\u1e5bti  also describes the southern limit of  Aryavarta  (i.e. the abode of the Aryans) as being defined by the Vindhya range. [22] \n Muslim, Central Asian and Afghan impacts as defining influences [ edit ] \n Several sources consider sizable Muslim populations and deep-seated Islamic, Central Asian and Afghan influences to be defining characteristics of North Indian culture, both linguistically and culturally. [23]  Some of these influences are pre-Islamic, such as the  Bactrian -originated  Kushan Empire  (modern day  Afghanistan ) that maintained twin capitals in  Mathura  (now in Uttar Pradesh) and  Peshawar  (in the present-day Pakistani  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  province), as well as the  Hun  confederacies that periodically asserted their rule over large parts of North India. [24] \n Geography [ edit ] \n Shilla  (7026 m) above the  Spiti Valley  in Himachal Pradesh \nThe  Thar desert  near Jaisalmer, Rajasthan \n North India lies mainly on continental India, north of peninsular India. [ citation needed ] [ Which part lies on insular India? ]  Towards its north are the Himalayas which define the boundary between the  Indian subcontinent  and the  Tibetan plateau . To its west is the  Thar  desert, shared between North India and  Pakistan  and the  Aravalli Range , beyond which lies the state of  Gujarat . The  Vindhya  mountains are, in some interpretations, taken to be the southern boundary of North India. \n The predominant geographical features of North India are: \n the Indo-Gangetic plain, which spans the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar; \n the Himalayas, which lie in the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir; \n the Thar desert, which lies mainly in the state of Rajasthan. \n The state of Madhya Pradesh has large areas under forest cover, as do Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh. [25] \n General climate [ edit ] \nIndia's  K\u00f6ppen climate classification  map [26]  is based on native vegetation, temperature, precipitation and their seasonality.(Major categories)\n \u00a0 \u00a0 (Am)  Tropical monsoon \n \u00a0 \u00a0 (Aw)  Tropical savanna, wet & dry \n \u00a0 \u00a0 (BWh)  Hot desert \n \u00a0 \u00a0 (BWk) Cold desert \n \u00a0 \u00a0 (BSh)  Hot semi arid \n \u00a0 \u00a0 (Cwa)  Subtropical humid  summer, dry winter \n \u00a0 \u00a0 (Cwb)  Subtropical highland , dry wint \n North India lies mainly in the north  temperate zone  of the  Earth . [27]  Though cool or cold winters, hot summers and moderate monsoons are the general pattern. North India is one of the most climatically diverse regions on Earth. During summer, the temperature often rises above 35\u00a0\u00b0C across much of the Indo-Gangetic plain, reaching as high as 60\u00a0\u00b0C in the Thar desert, Rajasthan and up to 49 in Delhi. During winter, the lowest temperature on the plains dips to below 5\u00a0\u00b0C, and below the freezing point in some states. Heavy to moderate snowfall occurs in Himachal Pradesh, J&K and Uttarakhand. Much of North India is notorious for heavy fog during winters. \n Extreme temperatures among inhabited regions have ranged from \u221245\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221249\u00a0\u00b0F) in  Dras , Jammu and Kashmir [28]  to 50.6\u00a0\u00b0C (123\u00a0\u00b0F) in  Alwar , Rajasthan.  Dras  is claimed to be the second-coldest inhabited place on the planet (after  Siberia ), with a recorded low of -60\u00a0\u00b0C. [29] [30] [31] \n Precipitation [ edit ] \n The region receives rain and snow precipitation through two primary weather patterns: the Indian  Monsoon  and the  Western Disturbances . The Monsoon carries moisture northwards from the  Indian Ocean , occurs in late summer and is important to the  Kharif or autumn harvest . [32] [33]  Western Disturbances, on the other hand, are an extratropical weather phenomenon that carry moisture eastwards from the  Mediterranean Sea , the  Caspian Sea  and the  Atlantic Ocean . [34] [35] [36] [37]  They primarily occur during the winter season and are critically important for the  Rabi or spring harvest , which includes the main staple over much of North India,  wheat . [35]  The states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand receive sustained snowfall in winter months. \n Traditional seasons [ edit ] \n Northern Indian tradition recognises six distinct seasons in the region: summer ( grishma  or  garmi , May\u2013June), rainy ( varsha , July\u2013August), cool ( sharad , September\u2013October, sometimes thought of as 'early autumn'), autumn ( hemant , November\u2013December, also called  patjhar , lit.  leaf-fall ), winter ( shishir  or  sardi , January\u2013February) and spring ( vasant , March\u2013April). The literature, poetry and folklore of the region uses references to these six seasons quite extensively and has done so since ancient times when  Sanskrit  was prevalent. [38] [39] [40]  In the mountainous areas, sometimes the winter is further divided into \"big winter\" (e.g.  Kashmiri   chillai kalaan ) and \"little winter\" ( chillai khurd ). [41] \n Demographics [ edit ] \n The people of North India mostly belong to the  Indo-Aryan  ethno linguistic branch, [ citation needed ]  and include various  ethnic groups  such as  Brahmins ,  Rajputs ,  Banias ,  Jats ,  Ahirs ,  Gurjars ,  Kolis ,  Khatris ,  Kambojs  and  Dalits . [42] [43] [44]  Other minority ethno-linguistic communities such as  Dravidian ,  Tibeto-Burman  and  Austroasiatic  exist throughout the region. \n Religion [ edit ] \n Religions in North India  [45] \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Hinduism  (79.72%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Islam  (16.19%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Sikhism  (2.11%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Christianity  (0.035%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0Other religions (0.09%) \n Hinduism  is the dominant religion in North India. [ citation needed ]  Other religions practiced by various ethnic communities include  Islam ,  Sikhism ,  Jainism ,  Zoroastrianism ,  Judaism ,  Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ,  Christianity , and  Buddhism . The states of  Uttarakhand ,  Rajasthan ,  Haryana ,  Madhya Pradesh ,  Gujarat  and  Himachal Pradesh  are overwhelmingly Hindu. The states of  Uttar Pradesh ,  Bihar  and  West Bengal  have Hindu majorities with a significantly large minority of Muslims; the combined Muslim population of these three states surpasses many of the biggest Islamic nations.  Jammu and Kashmir  is a  Muslim  majority state, while Punjab is the only state with a majority  Sikh  population. \n Languages [ edit ] \n Further information:  Languages of India ,  Indo-Aryan languages , and  Dravidian languages \nDistribution of  Indo-Aryan languages . \n Linguistically, North India is dominated by Indo-Aryan languages, although subregions of  Northern Dravidian languages ,  Tibeto-Burman languages  (such as Himachal's  Lahauli language ) and  Austroasiatic languages  (such as  Munda ) exist throughout the region. [ citation needed ] [ Nowhere do we define these subregions ]  It is in this region, or its proximity, that  Sanskrit  and the various  Prakrits  are thought to have evolved. [ citation needed ]  The most widely spoken Indo-Aryan language native to North India is the  Hindi Belt , which includes the  Hindustani   lingua franca  (including both its  Hindi  and Urdu  registers ), [46] [47]  a wide range of  western  and  eastern Hindi  dialects, ( Awadhi ,  Chattisgarhi ),  Bihari languages  ( Bhojpuri ,  Magadhi ),  Rajasthani languages  ( Marwari ,  Mewari ,  Shekhawati ,  Malwi ,  Bagri ),  Haryanvi ,  Pahari ,  Kumaoni ,  Garhwali ,  Punjabi ,  Kashmiri ,  Bengali  and  Nepali . The subregion where the  Hindi Belt  is widely spoken (as either primary or secondary languages) is sometimes called the  Hindi Heartland , and is loosely defined. [48] [49] [50] \n Small speaker populations of two  language isolates  ( Nihali  and  Burushaski ), which are not known to be rooted in any other language families, also exist in North India. [51] [52] \n Culture [ edit ] \n Dance [ edit ] \n Dance of North India too has diverse  folk  and  classical  forms. Among the well-known  folk dances  are the  bhangra  of the  Punjab , Ghoomar of Rajasthan and  rouf  and  bhand pather  of Kashmir. Main dance forms, many with narrative forms and  mythological  elements, have been accorded  classical dance status  by India's  National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama  such as  kathak   of  Uttar Pradesh . \n Clothing [ edit ] \n Further information:  Punjabi clothing ,  Jammu dress , and  Phiran \n Each state of North India has its own regional forms of clothing: \n Jammu :  Kurta / Dogri suthan  and kurta/churidar pajama and kurta. \n Kashmir :  Phiran and poots . \n Himachal Pradesh :  Shalwar kameez ,  Kurta ,  Churidar ,  Dhoti  and angarkha. \n Punjab / Haryana :  Salwar (Punjabi) Suit ,  Patiala salwar ,  Punjabi Tamba and Kurta ,  Sikh Dastar ,  Phulkari ,  Punjabi Ghagra \n Uttarakhand : Rangwali Phichora \n Flora and fauna [ edit ] \n Chinkara  in  Madhya Pradesh , India \n Further information:  Wildlife of India \n North Indian vegetation is predominantly deciduous and coniferous. Of the deciduous trees,  sal ,  teak ,  walnut ,  sheesham  (Indian rosewood) and  poplar  are some which are important commercially. [53]  The Western Himalayan region abounds in  chir ,  pine ,  deodar  (Himalayan cedar),  blue pine ,  spruce , various  firs ,  birch  and  junipers . [54] [55] [56] [57]  The birch, especially, has historical significance in Indian culture due to the extensive use of birch paper ( Sanskrit :  bhurja patra ) as parchment for many ancient Indian texts. [58] [59]  The Eastern Himalayan region consists of  oaks ,  laurels ,  maples ,  rhododendrons ,  alder , birch and  dwarf willows . Reflecting the diverse climatic zones and terrain contained in the region, the floral variety is extensive and ranges from Alpine to temperate thorn, coniferous to evergreen, and thick tropical jungles to cool temperate woods. [54] [60] \n There are around 500 varieties of mammals, 2000 species of birds, 30,000 types of insects and a wide variety of fish, amphibians and reptiles in the region. Animal species in North India include  elephant ,  tiger ,  leopard ,  snow leopard ,  sambar (Asiatic stag) ,  chital (spotted deer) ,  hangul (red deer) ,  hog deer ,  chinkara (Indian gazelle) ,  blackbuck ,  nilgai (blue bull antelope) ,  porcupine ,  wild boar ,  Indian fox ,  Tibetan sand fox ,  rhesus monkey ,  langur ,  jungle cat ,  hyena ,  jackal ,  black bear ,  Himalayan brown bear ,  sloth bear , and the endangered  caracal . \n Reptiles are represented by a large number of  snake  and  lizard  species, as well as the  ghariyal  and  crocodiles . [61]  Venomous snakes found in the region include  king cobra  and  krait . Various  scorpion ,  spider  and  insect  species include the commercially useful  honeybees ,  silkworms  and  lac  insects. The strikingly coloured  bir bahuti  is also found in this region. [62] \n The region has a wide variety of birds, including  peafowl ,  parrots , and thousands of immigrant birds, such as the  Siberian crane . Other birds include  pheasants ,  geese ,  ducks ,  mynahs ,  parakeets ,  pigeons ,  cranes  (including the celebrated  sarus crane ), and  hornbills .  great pied hornbill ,  Pallas's fishing eagle ,  grey-headed fishing eagle , red-thighed  falconet  are found in the Himalayan areas. Other birds found here are  tawny fish owl , scale-bellied woodpecker,  red-breasted parakeet ,  Himalayan swiftlet ,  stork-billed kingfisher  and  Himalayan or white-tailed rubythroat . [63] [64] \n Wildlife parks and reserves [ edit ] \n Important national parks and tiger reserves of North India include: \n Jim Corbett National Park \n Corbett National Park : It was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park [65]  along the banks of the Ramganga River. It is India's first National Park, and was designated a Project Tiger Reserve in 1973. Situated in  Nainital district  of Uttarakhand, the park acts as a protected area for the critically endangered Bengal tiger of India. Cradled in the foothills of the Himalayas, it comprises a total area of 500\u00a0km 2  out of which 350\u00a0km 2  is core reserve. This park is known not only for its rich and varied wildlife but also for its scenic beauty. \n Nanda Devi National Park  and  Valley of Flowers National Park : Located in West Himalaya, in the state of Uttarakhand, these two national parks constitute a biosphere reserve that is in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves since 2004. The Valley of Flowers is known for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers and the variety of flora, this richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered animals. \n Dachigam National Park : Dachigam is a higher altitude national reserve in the state of Jammu and Kashmir that ranges from 5,500 to 14,000 feet above sea level. It is home to the  hangul  (a  red deer  species, also called the Kashmir stag). \n Great Himalayan National Park : This park is located in Himachal Pradesh and ranges in altitude from 5,000 to 17,500 feet. Wildlife resident here includes the  snow leopard , the  Himalayan brown bear  and the  musk deer . \n Desert National Park : Located in Rajasthan, this national reserve features extensive sand dunes and dry salt lakes. Wildlife unique to the region includes the desert fox and the  great Indian bustard . \n Kanha National Park : The sal and bamboo forests, grassy meadows and ravines of Kanha were the setting for  Rudyard Kipling 's collection of stories, \" The Jungle Book \". The Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh came into being in 1955 and forms the core of the Kanha Tiger Reserve, created in 1974 under Project Tiger. \n Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary : Located in the state of Bihar, it is the only protected zone for the endangered  Ganges and Indus river dolphin . \n Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary : It is one of the finest bird parks in the world, it is a reserve that offers protection to faunal species as well. Nesting indigenous water birds as well as migratory water birds and waterside birds, this sanctuary is also inhabited by sambar, chital, nilgai and boar. \n Dudhwa National Park : It covers an area of 500\u00a0km 2  along the Indo-Nepal border in  Lakhimpur Kheri district  of Uttar Pradesh, is best known for the  barasingha  or swamp deer. The grasslands and woodlands of this park, consist mainly of sal forests. The barasingha is found in the southwest and southeast regions of the park. Among the big cats, tigers abound at Dudhwa. There are also a few leopards. The other animals found in large numbers, are the  Indian rhinoceros , elephant, jungle cats, leopard cats, fishing cats, jackals,  civets ,  sloth bears , sambar,  otters , crocodiles and  chital . \n Ranthambhore National Park : It spans an area of 400\u00a0km 2  with an estimated head count of thirty two tigers is perhaps India's finest example of  Project Tiger , a conservation effort started by the government in an attempt to save the dwindling number of tigers in India. Situated near the small town of  Sawai Madhopur  it boasts of variety of plant and animal species of North India. \n Kalesar National Park : Kalesar is a  sal  forest in the  Shivalik Hills  of eastern Haryana state. Primarily known for birds, it also contains a small number of tigers and panthers. \n Places of interest [ edit ] \n Akshardham  Temple, Delhi \n Nature [ edit ] \n The Indian  Himalayas , the  Thar desert  and the  Indo-Gangetic plain  dominate the natural scenery of North India. The region encompasses several of the most highly regarded hill destinations of India such as  Srinagar ,  Shimla ,  Manali ,  Nainital ,  Mussoorie ,  Kausani  and  Mount Abu . Several spots in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh provide panoramic views of the snow-clad Himalayan range. The Himalayan region also provides ample opportunity for adventure sports such as mountaineering, trekking, river rafting and skiing. Camel or jeep safaris of the Thar desert are also popular in the state of Rajasthan. North India includes several national parks such as the  Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve ,  Jim Corbett National Park ,  Keoladeo National Park  and  Ranthambore National Park . \n Pilgrimage [ edit ] \n North India encompasses several of the holiest pilgrimage centres of Hinduism ( Varanasi ,  Haridwar ,  Allahabad ,  Char Dham ,  Vaishno Devi ,  Rishikesh ,  Ayodhya ,  Mathura / Vrindavan ,  Pushkar ,  Prayag  and seven of the twelve  Jyotirlinga  sites), the most sacred destinations of Buddhism ( Bodh Gaya ,  Sarnath  and  Kushinagar ), the most regarded pilgrimage centres of Sikhism ( Amritsar  and  Hemkund ) and some of the highly regarded destinations in Sufi Islam ( Ajmer  and  Delhi ). The largest Hindu temple,  Akshardham Temple , the largest Buddhist temple in India,  Mahabodhi , the largest mosque in India,  Jama Masjid , and the largest Sikh shrine,  Golden Temple , are all in this region. [66] [67] \n Historical [ edit ] \n Amer Fort  in  Rajasthan \n North India includes some highly regarded historical, architectural and archaeological treasures of India. The  Taj Mahal , an immense mausoleum of white marble in  Agra , is one of the universally admired buildings of world heritage. [68]  Besides Agra,  Fatehpur Sikri  and  Delhi  also carry some great exhibits from the Mughal architecture.  Gwalior  has some rich cultural sites.  Gwalior Fort , Sun Temple, which was made by Birla group. Also Jai vilas palace shows maharaja culture. In Punjab,  Patiala  is known for being the city of royalty while  Amritsar  is a city known for it's  Sikh Architecture  and the  Golden Temple .  Lucknow  has the famous Awadhi Nawab culture while  Kanpur  reflects excellent British architecture with monuments like  Edward Hall , Police Quarters, Cutchery Cemetery etc.  Khajuraho temples  constitute another famous world heritage site. The state of Rajasthan is known for exquisite  palaces  and  forts  of the  Rajput  clans. Historical sites and architecture from the ancient and medieval  Hindu  and  Buddhist  periods of Indian history, such as  Jageshwar ,  Deogarh  and  Sanchi , as well as sites from the  bronze age   Indus Valley Civilization , such as  Manda  and  Alamgirpur , can be found scattered throughout northern India.  Varanasi , on the banks of the  River Ganga , is considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and the second oldest in India after  Nalanda .  Bhimbetka  is an archaeological site of the  Paleolithic  era, exhibiting the earliest traces of human life on the Indian subcontinent. \n Universities [ edit ] \n North India has several universities, including \n Agra University \n All India Institute of Medical Sciences \n Allahabad University \n Aligarh Muslim University \n Avadh University \n Benaras Hindu University \n Birla Institute of Technology and Science \n Central University of Rajasthan \n Delhi University \n Delhi Technological University \n Gautam Buddha University \n Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture & Technology \n Gurukul Kangri University \n Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology \n Haryana Agricultural University \n Jai Narain Vyas University \n Jawaharlal Nehru University \n Jiwaji University \n Kanpur University \n Kumaon University \n Kurukshetra University \n Maharaja Ganga Singh University \n Maharana Pratap University \n O. P. Jindal Global University , [69] \n Panjab University \n Patna University \n Punjab Technical University \n Srm university \n University of Ajmer \n University of Jammu \n University of Kashmir \n University of Kota \n University of Lucknow \n University of Rajasthan \n Uttarakhand Technical University \n Vardhaman Mahaveer Open University \n and many more. The  Indian Institute of Technology ,  National Institute of Technology  and  Indian Institute of Management  have campuses in several cities of North India such as  Delhi ,  Kanpur ,  Roorkee ,  Varanasi ,  Lucknow ,  Kashipur ,  Indore  and  Patna . One of the first great universities in recorded history, the  Nalanda University , is in the state of  Bihar . There has been  plans for revival  of this ancient university, including an effort by a multinational consortium led by Singapore, China, India and Japan. \n Economy [ edit ] \n Further information:  Economy of India \n The economy of North India is predominantly agrarian, but is changing fast with rapid economic growth that has ranged above 8% annually. Several parts of North India have prospered as a consequence of the  Green Revolution , including Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, and have experienced both economic and social development. [70] [71] [72]  The eastern areas of East Uttar Pradesh, however, have lagged [73] [74]  and the resulting disparity has contributed to a demand for separate statehood in West Uttar Pradesh (the  Harit Pradesh  movement). [75] [76]  Bihar's economy has been the fastest growing state economy in India, higher than all the Indian states including  Gujarat . \n However the birth rate in North India is much higher than in other parts of the country and this can lead to poverty and related problems. [77]  Joblessness is a critical problem in North India and cannot be tackled easily because of the lack of hi-tech industries in the region. A large number of unskilled and skilled workers have moved to Southern India and other nations because of the unavailability of jobs locally. [78]  The technology boom that occurred in the past three decades in Southern India has helped many Indians from the north to find jobs and live prosperous lives in Southern cities. \n The states with the highest GDP per capita in North India are Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. The National Capital Region of Delhi has emerged as an economic power house with rapid industrial growth along with adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. [79]  Chandigarh has the highest per-capita State Domestic Product (SDP) of any Indian union territory.
