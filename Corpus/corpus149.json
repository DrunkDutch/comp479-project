There are no exceptions. If you do not have a permanent code, you will pay a surcharge on top of your tuition fees. \n Permanent code surcharge \n                    About the surcharge\r\n Concordia adds a  surcharge  to your fees if you\u00a0 do not provide us with required permanent code information . This surcharge covers the funding withheld by the Quebec government when Concordia does not provide them with a student's permanent code. \n This surcharge is also applied if you provide us with a permanent code that is: \n Invalid or fictitious \n Cannot be processed (e.g. a permanent code from a francophone university) \n                    Surcharge deadlines\r\n You will be billed at the time of registration  if we do not have your permanent code. When you provide the information, the surcharge will be removed subject to the following deadlines: \n Summer Admission :\u00a0August 15 \n Fall Admission:\u00a0 \u00a0December 15 \n Winter Admission:  April 15 \n If it you submit information after that date, the billing will remain and interest charges will accrue. \n Existing permanent codes \n                    What a permanent code looks like\r\n 12 character code  that consists of the first 3 letters of the family name, the first letter of the given name, the date of birth (day, month [the female gender is identified by adding 50], year) and 2 validation numbers as determined by the  Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation et de l\u2019Enseignement sup\u00e9rieur  (MEES). The number 62 is added to the day of birth of all students born after 1999. \n \u00a0 \n                    Find your permanent code\r\n You will have already been assigned a permanent code if you attended: \n High School or CEGEP in Quebec or if \n You have received Quebec Financial Aid \n To find it, look at your school records. Check for it in the:\u00a0 \n Upper right hand corner of your CEGEP transcript \n Upper left-hand corner of your High School Transcript\u00a0 \n Upper right-hand corner of the Financial Aid Notice and Detailed Calculation Form.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n                    Permanent codes assigned by francophone universities\r\n If you attended a francophone university in Quebec, you may have been assigned a university permanent code.\u00a0 That code is valid only for that university .
