The idea behind iMUSE is to synchronize music with the visual action in a video game so that the audio continuously matches the on-screen events and transitions from one musical theme to another are done seamlessly. [1]  iMUSE was developed in the early 1990s by composers  Michael Land  and  Peter McConnell  while working at  LucasArts . The iMUSE system is  patented  by LucasArts, [2]  and was added to the fifth version of the  SCUMM  game engine in 1991. [3] \n Contents \n 1   Development \n 2   Usage \n 3   See also \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n Development [ edit ] \n iMUSE was developed out of  Michael Land 's frustration for the audio system used by LucasArts while composing  The Secret of Monkey Island . His goal was to create a system which would enable the composer to set the mood via music according to the events of the game. The project was much more daring than he had imagined. He brought in an old friend,  Peter McConnell , to collaborate on creating the system, which they later patented together. [4]  iMUSE was also found to be useful to account for differences in processing speed between personal computers at the time, as there was no directs means of synchronizing sound and gameplay rendering. To account for this, the iMUSE system acts as a  pit orchestra , according to McConnell, playing back shorter or longer sections of music while waiting for key events to occur within the game's drawing engine. [5] \n The first game to use the iMUSE system was  Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge , [6]  and it has been used in all  LucasArts adventure games  since. [7]  It has also been used for some non-adventure LucasArts titles such as the DOS version of  Star Wars: TIE Fighter . [8] \n Usage [ edit ] \n One often cited example of the iMUSE system is at the very beginning of  Monkey Island 2  where Guybrush finds himself in Woodtick, the small town on Scabb Island. Whenever Guybrush walks into a building, a variation of the Woodtick theme plays, each with a different instrument. [9]  When Guybrush then walks out again the music has a closing flourish that leads back into the basic Woodtick theme.
