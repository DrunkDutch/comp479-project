Some of you didn\u2019t open a chequing account while you were still living and studying at home. At that stage, a basic savings account is likely to be all you needed - as a home for hard-saved money, like birthday and Christmas cash gifts. \u00a0But now that you\u2019re at university you'll almost certainly need an account with more services and options to help you pay your way in the world.\u00a0 \n Shop around to find the best account  for your needs. Most banks and credit unions are happy to offer student accounts - they hope you'll stick with them for life, as many people do. Student accounts usually have  no fees  or  very low fees  with  unlimited debit transactions  and perks designed to appeal to students.\u00a0 \n Banks can include a range of incentives to sign up, such as free CDs, MP3\u2019s or discounts on movies and travel. However, before you sign up just because you're attracted by a free MP3, think about what you need from a current account.\u00a0Most accounts will provide some services as a minimum, but there may be some specific requirements that could make a big difference to you, like  access to a student banking advisor \u00a0or provide\u00a0 loans for postgraduate training . \u00a0 \n Things to consider when choosing a bank or financial instituion: \n Recognition:\u00a0 Make sure that the bank accepts and processes Government Issued Loan documents. Some government funding programs only authorized specific banking institutions to process their government loan documents. \n Overdraft:\u00a0 One of the key features of a current account is its overdraft facility. \u00a0However, nothing is free and the fees or interest rate you pay can go through the roof. \u00a0 \n Free Banking : Check that free banking is offered. This generally means that you can operate the basics of your account without incurring costs, so long as the account remains in credit. Also, check what charges you might incur if you stray outside agreed limits without prior agreement.\u00a0 \n Student Advisors : Many banks offer access to a banking advisor who will give advice on how best to manage your finances.\u00a0 \n Additional Services : Some accounts will offer services such as commission-free travellers cheques, discounted insurance and preferential personal loans.\u00a0 \n Branch Location: \u00a0Having a branch near to you can be very useful when you're a busy student. You just can\u2019t afford to pay 1.50-3.00 per transaction at ATM\u2019s. \u00a0Some banks have branches on campus and this may be the best option if you want easy branch access. \u00a0 \n Incentives:\u00a0 If, after deciding what features are important to you, you've narrowed your choice down to a small number of banks, consider the incentives they offer. \u00a0 \n Next step: visit us for advice \n Learn about apps and other tools \n Buying on credit Banking and financial institutions Visit us for advice Basic steps to making a budget \n Connect with us \n Financial Aid & Awards Office \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
