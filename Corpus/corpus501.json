[1]  In the chapter titled \"Cheri Caffaro: A Strange Interlewd,\" Wilson writes about his experience interviewing actress  Cheri Caffaro  while she was nude and he was fully dressed.

A typical scene may be a depiction of  white slavery  in which one or several nude female slaves are displayed before an audience of men at a  slave market . The archetypal example of this type of scene is  Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me 's  The Slave Market , in which a nude female slave is examined by a potential buyer. Another example is G\u00e9r\u00f4me's  Phryn\u00e9 devant l'Areopage  ( Phryne before the  Areopagus , 1861) which was based on the trial of  Phryne  before the Areopagus in ancient Greece. The  odalisque  (harem scene) was also a popular subject for depicting one-sided female nudity, although the clothed figures in the scene were not always male. \n Outside of the Orientalist style, a scenario for one-sided female nudity in 19th-century art was the knight-errant, in which the  damsel in distress  was used to explore the erotic subtext of the powerful knight coming to the rescue of a helpless woman. The best known example of this is John Everett Millais' painting  Knight Errant , in which a nude woman has been tied to a tree and a knight is shown cutting her loose. \n Another example is  \u00c9douard Manet 's  Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe  (\"The Luncheon on the Grass\"), in which a nude woman is depicted having lunch with two fully clothed men. The  Pastoral Concert  (c. 1510) attributed to  Giorgione  or his pupil  Titian [3]  has been cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting. \n A 1913 painting  Adoration  by  William Strang  presents a philosophical study of beauty, with the clothed soldier, painter, scholar, and elderly gentleman fascinated by the naked female subject. \n See also [ edit ] \n Bottom (BDSM) \n Candaulism \n Clothed female, naked male \n Erotic humiliation \n Exhibitionism \n Female submission \n Nyotaimori \n Voyeurism \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Show Business Laid Bare , by Earl Wilson,  ISBN \u00a0 0-399-11276-6 , New York, G.
