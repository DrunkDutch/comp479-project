It is located south of  Turkey , west of  Syria  and  Lebanon , northwest of  Israel , north of  Egypt , and southeast of  Greece . \n The  earliest known human activity  on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved  Neolithic  village of  Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world. [9]  Cyprus was settled by  Mycenaean Greeks  in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. As a strategic location in the  Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several  major powers , including the empires of the  Assyrians ,  Egyptians  and  Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by  Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by  Ptolemaic Egypt , the  Classical  and  Eastern Roman Empire ,  Arab   caliphates  for a short period, the French  Lusignan dynasty  and the  Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of  Ottoman rule  between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure  until 1914). [10] \n Cyprus was  placed under British administration based on the Cyprus Convention  in 1878 and was formally annexed by Britain in 1914. While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of  Turkish Cypriot  leaders and Turkey in the 1950s. Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an \"extension of Anatolia\" by them; while, since the 19th century, [11] [12]  the majority  Greek Cypriot  population and its  Orthodox church  had been pursuing union with Greece, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s. [13]  Following nationalist violence in the 1950s, Cyprus was  granted independence  in 1960. [14]  In 1963, the 11-year  intercommunal violence  between  Greek Cypriots  and  Turkish Cypriots  started, which displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots [15] [16]  and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic. On 15 July 1974, a  coup d'\u00e9tat  was staged by  Greek Cypriot nationalists [17] [18]  and elements of the  Greek military junta [19]  in an attempt at  enosis , the incorporation of Cyprus into Greece. This action precipitated the  Turkish invasion of Cyprus  on 20 July, [20]  which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus in the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed, and the  displacement  of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots [21] [22]  and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots. [23]  A separate  Turkish Cypriot state in the north  was  established by unilateral declaration  in 1983; the move was widely condemned by the  international community , with Turkey alone  recognizing  the new state. These events and the resulting political situation are matters of a  continuing dispute . \n The Republic of Cyprus has  de jure   sovereignty  over the entire island, including its  territorial waters  and  exclusive economic zone , with the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of  Akrotiri and Dhekelia , which remain under British control according to the  London and Z\u00fcrich Agreements . However, the Republic of Cyprus is  de facto  partitioned into two main parts: the area under the effective control of the Republic, located in the south and west, and comprising about 59% of the island's area; and the north, [24]  administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, covering about 36% of the island's area. Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the  UN buffer zone . The international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish forces. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law, amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since Cyprus became a member of the  European Union . [30] \n Cyprus is a major tourist destination in the Mediterranean. [31] [32] [33]  With an  advanced , [34]   high-income economy  and a very high  Human Development Index , [35] [36]  the Republic of Cyprus has been a member of the  Commonwealth  since 1961 and was a founding member of the  Non-Aligned Movement  until it joined the European Union on 1 May 2004. [37]  On 1 January 2008, the Republic of Cyprus joined the  eurozone . \n Contents \n 1   Etymology \n 2   History \n 2.1   Prehistoric and Ancient Cyprus \n 2.2   Middle Ages \n 2.3   Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire \n 2.3.1   Numeracy \n 2.4   Cyprus under the British Empire \n 2.5   Independence and inter-communal violence \n 2.6   1974 coup, Turkish invasion and division \n 2.7   Post-division \n 3   Geography \n 3.1   Climate \n 3.2   Water supply \n 4   Politics \n 4.1   Administrative divisions \n 4.2   Exclaves and enclaves \n 4.3   Foreign relations \n 4.4   Law, justice and human rights \n 4.5   Armed forces \n 5   Economy \n 5.1   Transport \n 5.2   Communications \n 6   Demographics \n 6.1   Functional urban areas \n 6.2   Religion \n 6.3   Languages \n 6.4   Education \n 7   Culture \n 7.1   Arts \n 7.2   Music \n 7.3   Literature \n 7.4   Mass media \n 7.5   Cinema \n 7.6   Cuisine \n 7.7   Sports \n 8   See also \n 9   Notes \n 10   References \n 11   Further reading \n 12   External links \n Etymology \nA copper mine in Cyprus. In antiquity, Cyprus was a major source of copper. \n The earliest attested reference to  Cyprus  is the 15th century BC  Mycenaean Greek   \ud800\udc13\ud800\udc20\ud800\udc2a\ud800\udc0d ,  ku-pi-ri-jo , [38]  meaning \"Cypriot\" (Greek:  \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ), written in  Linear B  syllabic script. [39]  The classical Greek form of the name is  \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( K\u00fdpros ) . \n The etymology of the name is unknown. Suggestions include: \n the Greek word for the  Mediterranean cypress tree  ( Cupressus sempervirens ), \u03ba\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 ( kyp\u00e1rissos ) \n the Greek name of the  henna  plant ( Lawsonia alba ), \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( k\u00fdpros ) \n an  Eteocypriot  word for  copper . It has been suggested, for example, that it has roots in the  Sumerian  word for copper ( zubar ) or for  bronze  ( kubar ), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island. [40] \n Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the  Classical Latin  word for copper through the phrase  aes Cyprium , \"metal of Cyprus\", later shortened to  Cuprum . [40] [41] \n The standard  demonym  relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is  Cypriot . The terms  Cypriote  and  Cyprian  are also used, though less frequently. \n History \n Main articles:  History of Cyprus  and  Timeline of Cypriot history \nEarly Greek colonization of Cyprus \n Prehistoric and Ancient Cyprus \n Main articles:  Prehistoric Cyprus  and  Ancient history of Cyprus \nArcheologic site of Choirokoitia with early remains of human habitation during Aceramic Neolithic period (reconstruction) \n The earliest confirmed site of human activity on Cyprus is  Aetokremnos , situated on the south coast, indicating that  hunter-gatherers  were active on the island from around  10,000 BC , [42]  with settled  village communities  dating from 8200 BC. The arrival of the first humans correlates with the extinction of the  dwarf hippos  and  dwarf elephants . [43]   Water wells  discovered by  archaeologists  in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old. [9] \n Remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with a human body at a separate  Neolithic  site in Cyprus. [44]  The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old (7500\u00a0BC), predating  ancient Egyptian  civilisation and pushing back the  earliest known feline-human association  significantly. [45]  The remarkably well-preserved Neolithic village of  Khirokitia  is a UNESCO  World Heritage Site  dating to approximately 6800 BC. [46] \nSanctuary of Apollo Hylates,  Kourion \n During the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement. [47]  The first wave consisted of  Mycenaean Greek  traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC. [48] [49]  A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the  Bronze Age collapse  of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050\u00a0BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period. [49] [50]  Cyprus occupies an important role in  Greek mythology  being the birthplace of  Aphrodite  and  Adonis , and home to  King Cinyras ,  Teucer  and  Pygmalion . [51]  Beginning in the 8th century\u00a0BC  Phoenician colonies  were founded on the south coast of Cyprus, near present-day  Larnaca  and  Salamis . [49] \n Cyprus is at a strategic location in the Middle East. [52] [53] [54]  It was ruled by  Assyria  for a century starting in 708\u00a0BC, before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually  Persian  rule in 545\u00a0BC. [49]  The Cypriots, led by  Onesilus , king of Salamis, joined their fellow Greeks in the  Ionian  cities during the unsuccessful  Ionian Revolt  in 499\u00a0BC against the  Achaemenid Empire . The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the Greek world. [49] \n The island was conquered by  Alexander the Great  in 333\u00a0BC. Following his death and the subsequent  division of his empire  and  wars among his successors , Cyprus became part of the  Hellenistic empire  of  Ptolemaic Egypt . It was during this period that the island was fully  Hellenized . In 58\u00a0BC Cyprus was acquired by the  Roman Republic . [49] \n Middle Ages \n Main articles:  Cyprus in the Middle Ages  and  Kingdom of Cyprus \nThe  Walls of Nicosia  were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack \n Kyrenia Castle  was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians \n When the  Roman Empire  was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395, Cyprus became part of the East Roman, or  Byzantine Empire , and would remain so until the  Crusades  some 800 years later. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community. [49] \n Beginning in 649, Cyprus  suffered from devastating raids launched by Muslim armies  from the  Levant , which continued for the next 300 years. [49]  Many were quick piratical raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed. [49] \n There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period; thousands of people were killed, and many cities \u2013 such as  Salamis  \u2013 were destroyed and never rebuilt. [49]  Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor  Nikephoros II Phokas  scored decisive victories on land and sea. [49] \n In 1191, during the  Third Crusade ,  Richard I of England  captured the island from  Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus [55]  He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the  Saracens . A year later Richard sold the island to the  Knights Templar , who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to  Guy of Lusignan . His brother and successor  Aimery  was recognised as  King of Cyprus  by  Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor . [49] \n Following the death in 1473 of  James II , the last Lusignan king, the  Republic of Venice  assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen  Catherine Cornaro , reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the  Kingdom of Cyprus  in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. [49]  The Venetians fortified  Nicosia  by building the  Walls of Nicosia , and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the  Ottoman Empire  frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed  Limassol  and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified  Famagusta  and  Kyrenia . [49] \n Although the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island [49]  is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek  middle ranks , [56]  and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King  John II of Cyprus  who married  Helena Palaiologina . [57] \n Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire \n Main article:  Ottoman Cyprus \n In 1570, a full-scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta. Ottoman forces capturing Cyprus  massacred  many Greek and Armenian Christian inhabitants. [58]  The previous Latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a Muslim community. [59]  Soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and Turkish peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from  Anatolia . [60]  This new community also included banished Anatolian tribes, \"undesirable\" persons and members of various \"troublesome\" Muslim sects, as well as a number of new converts on the island. [61] \nHistorical map of Cyprus by  Piri Reis \n The Ottomans abolished the  feudal  system previously in place and applied the  millet system  to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the  Church of Cyprus  was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church. [62]  Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials, and the island began over 250 years of economic decline. [63] \n The ratio of Muslims to Christians fluctuated throughout the period of Ottoman domination. In 1777\u201378, 47,000 Muslims constituted a majority over the island's 37,000 Christians. [64]  By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000, comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians. [65]  The Muslim population included numerous  crypto-Christians , [66]  including the  Linobambaki , a crypto-Catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the Catholic community by the Ottoman authorities; [66] [67]  this community would assimilate into the Turkish Cypriot community during British rule. [68] \n As soon as the  Greek War of Independence  broke out in 1821, several Greek Cypriots left for Greece to join the Greek forces. In response, the Ottoman governor of Cyprus arrested and executed 486 prominent Greek Cypriots, including the Archbishop of Cyprus,  Kyprianos , and four other bishops. [69]  In 1828, modern Greece's first president  Ioannis Kapodistrias  called for union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place. [70]  Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Turks, the unrelenting poverty of most of the people, and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism, and by the 20th century idea of  enosis , or union, with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots. [63] \n Numeracy \n Under the Ottoman rule, numeracy, school enrollment and literacy rates were all low. In some countries, these low levels of human capital level persisted sometime after Ottoman rule ended. Greece and Cyprus were no exception, they faced the same issue of paths taken under Ottoman educational policies. In these two countries (Greece and Cyprus), numeracy increased rapidly during the twentieth century. [71] \n Cyprus under the British Empire \n Main article:  Modern history of Cyprus \nHoisting the British flag at Nicosia \n In the aftermath of the  Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)  and the  Congress of Berlin , Cyprus was  leased  to the  British Empire  which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, Cyprus remained a  de jure  Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with  Egypt and Sudan ) [10]  in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression. [49] \n Greek Cypriot  demonstrations for  Enosis  (union with  Greece ) in 1930 \n The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the  Suez Canal , the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the  First World War  and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the  Central Powers , on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus and declared the Ottoman  Khedivate  of  Egypt and Sudan  a  Sultanate  and British protectorate . [10] [49] \n In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to  Constantine I of Greece  on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British, which he declined. In 1923, under the  Treaty of Lausanne , the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus, [72]  and in 1925 it was declared a British  crown colony . [49]  Many Greek and Turkish Cypriots fought in the  British Army  during both  world wars . [73] [ not in citation given ]  During the  Second World War , many enlisted in the  Cyprus Regiment . \n The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to  enosis . The idea of  enosis  was historically part of the  Megali Idea , a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with Greek inhabitants in the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and  Asia Minor  with a capital in  Constantinople , and was actively pursued by the  Cypriot Orthodox Church , which had its members educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the  Megali Idea , would later found the guerrilla organisation  Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston or  National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters ( EOKA ). [74] [75]  The Greek Cypriots viewed the island as historically Greek and believed that union with Greece was a natural right. [76]  In the 1950s, the pursuit of  enosis  became a part of the Greek national policy, [77] \n\u0392ritish soldier taking aim at Greek Cypriot demonstrators in Nicosia, 1956 \n Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. [78]  However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for  enosis  as they saw the union of  Crete  with Greece, which led to the exodus of  Cretan Turks , as a precedent to be avoided, [79] [80]  and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. [81]  The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to  self-determination  from Greek Cypriots. [76]  Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader  Menderes  considered Cyprus an \"extension of Anatolia\", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that \"Cyprus is Turkish\" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan \"Partition or Death\" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Z\u00fcrich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island. [82] [83] \n In January 1950, the Church of Cyprus organised a  referendum  under the supervision of clerics and with no Turkish Cypriot participation, [84]  where 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of  enosis , [85] [86] [87]  The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island' s population at the time ( census 1946 ). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with Greece through armed struggle. At the same time the  Turkish Resistance Organisation  (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the Turkish Cypriots as a counterweight. [88]  The British had also adopted at the time a policy of \"divide and rule\". Woodhouse [ who? ] , a British official in Cyprus, revealed that then British Foreign Secretary  Harold Macmillan  \"urged the Britons in Cyprus to stir up the Turks in order to neutralise Greek agitation\". [ citation needed ]  British officials also tolerated the creation of the Turkish underground organisation T.M.T. The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of Cyprus not to act against T.M.T despite its illegal actions so as not to harm British relations with the Turkish government. [83] \n Independence and inter-communal violence \n Main article:  Cypriot intercommunal violence \nThe first president of Cyprus,  Makarios III \n On 16 August 1960, Cyprus attained independence after the  Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement  between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others. [89]  The UK retained the two  Sovereign Base Areas  of  Akrotiri and Dhekelia , while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights. \n However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of Greece and Turkey respectively. The Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the  Akritas plan , which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan. [90]  Tensions were heightened when Cypriot President Archbishop  Makarios III  called for  constitutional changes , which were rejected by Turkey [15]  and opposed by Turkish Cypriots. [90] \n Intercommunal violence  erupted  on 21 December 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots, [91]  destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000\u201330,000 Turkish Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy; [15]  the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration. [92]  Turkish Cypriots started living in  enclaves ; the republic's structure was changed, unilaterally, by Makarios and Nicosia was divided by the  Green Line , with the deployment of  UNFICYP  troops. [15] \n In 1964, Turkey threatened to invade Cyprus [93]  in response to the continuing  Cypriot intercommunal violence , but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President  Lyndon B. Johnson  on 5 June, warning that the US would not stand beside Turkey in case of a consequential  Soviet  invasion of Turkish territory. [94]  Meanwhile, by 1964,  enosis  was a Greek policy that could not be abandoned; Makarios and the Greek prime minister  Georgios Papandreou  agreed that  enosis  should be the ultimate aim and King  Constantine  wished Cyprus \"a speedy union with the mother country\". Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion. [95] \n 1974 coup, Turkish invasion and division \n Main articles:  1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat  and  Turkish invasion of Cyprus \n On 15 July 1974, the  Greek military junta  under  Dimitrios Ioannides  carried out a  coup d'\u00e9tat  in Cyprus, to  unite the island with Greece . [96] [97] [98]  The coup ousted president  Makarios III  and replaced him with pro- enosis  nationalist  Nikos Sampson . [99]  In response to the coup, [100] [101] [102] [103] [104]  five days later, on 20 July 1974, the  Turkish army invaded  the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960  Treaty of Guarantee . This justification has been rejected by the United Nations and the international community. [105] \n The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions in Cyprus, and hundreds of  paratroopers  were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia, where well-armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long-established; while off the Kyrenia coast, Turkish troop ships landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles. [106] [107] \n Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed, [108]  Turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and the Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself. [108]  The junta in  Athens , and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power. In Nicosia,  Glafkos Clerides  assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored, removing the pretext for the Turkish invasion. [108]  But after the peace negotiations in  Geneva , the Turkish government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 August. [109]  The invasion resulted in the seizure of  Morphou ,  Karpass , Famagusta and the  Mesaoria . \n International pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 36% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north. [110]  At the same time, around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots. Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey, in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using American-supplied equipment during the  Turkish invasion of Cyprus  in 1974. [111]  There are 1,534 Greek Cypriots [112]  and 502 Turkish Cypriots [113]  missing as a result of the fighting. \n Post-division \nA map showing the division of Cyprus \n After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop Makarios III to Cyprus in December 1974, Turkish troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot leader proclaimed the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  (TRNC), which is recognised only by Turkey. \n The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the  politics  on the island, as well as  Greco-Turkish relations . Around 150,000 settlers from Turkey are believed to be living in the north\u2014many of whom were forced from Turkey by the Turkish government\u2014in violation of the  Geneva Convention  and various  UN resolutions . [114] [115] \nForeign Ministers of the European Union countries in Limassol during Cyprus Presidency of the EU in 2012 \n The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year. [116]  The last major effort to settle the  Cyprus dispute  was the  Annan Plan  in 2004, drafted by the then Secretary General, Kofi Annan. The plan was put to a  referendum  in both Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus. 65% of Turkish Cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74% Greek Cypriots voted against the plan, claiming that it disproportionately favoured the Turkish side. [117]  In total, 66.7% of the voters  rejected the Annan Plan V . On 1 May 2004 Cyprus joined the European Union, together with nine other countries. [118]  Cyprus was accepted into the EU as a whole, although the EU legislation is suspended in Northern Cyprus until a final settlement of the Cyprus problem. In July 2006, the island served as a haven for people fleeing Lebanon, due to the conflict between Israel and  Hezbollah  (also called \" The July War \"). [119] \n Efforts have been made to enhance freedom of movement between the two sides. In April 2003, Northern Cyprus unilaterally eased border restrictions, permitting Cypriots to cross between the two sides for the first time in 30 years. [120]  In March 2008, a wall that had stood for decades at the boundary between the Republic of Cyprus and the  UN buffer zone  was demolished. [121]  The wall had cut across  Ledra Street  in the heart of Nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the island's 32-year division. On 3 April 2008, Ledra Street was reopened in the presence of Greek and Turkish Cypriot officials. [122]  North and South relaunched reunification talks on 15 May 2015. [123] \n Geography \n Main article:  Geography of Cyprus \nAvakas Gorge in Akamas \n Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after the Italian islands of  Sicily  and  Sardinia  (both in terms of area and population). It is also the  world's 80th largest by area  and  world's 51st largest by population . It measures 240 kilometres (149\u00a0mi) long from end to end and 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) wide at its widest point, with Turkey 75 kilometres (47\u00a0mi) to the north. It lies between latitudes  34\u00b0  and  36\u00b0 N , and longitudes  32\u00b0  and  35\u00b0 E . \n Petra tou Romiou  (\"Rock of the Greek\"). \n Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east (105 and 108 kilometres (65 and 67\u00a0mi), respectively), Israel 200 kilometres (124\u00a0mi) to the southeast, Egypt 380 kilometres (236\u00a0mi) to the south, and Greece to the northwest: 280 kilometres (174\u00a0mi) to the small  Dodecanesian  island of  Kastellorizo  (Megisti), 400 kilometres (249\u00a0mi) to  Rhodes  and 800 kilometres (497\u00a0mi) to the Greek mainland. Sources alternatively place Cyprus in Europe, [124] [125] [126]  or Western Asia and the Middle East. [127] [128] \n The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the  Troodos Mountains  and the smaller  Kyrenia Range , and the central plain they encompass, the  Mesaoria . The Mesaoria plain is drained by the  Pedieos River , the longest on the island. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is  Mount Olympus  at 1,952\u00a0m (6,404\u00a0ft), located in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of 1,024\u00a0m (3,360\u00a0ft). The island lies within the  Anatolian Plate . [129] \n Geopolitically , the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled  Green Line  provides a  buffer zone  that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly,  two bases under British sovereignty  are located on the island:  Akrotiri and Dhekelia , covering the remaining 2.74%. \n Climate \n Main article:  Climate of Cyprus \nThe sandy beaches are often used as habitats for  green turtles . In the photo  Nissi beach \n Cyprus has a  subtropical climate  \u2013  Mediterranean  and  semi-arid  type (in the north-eastern part of the island) \u2013  K\u00f6ppen climate classifications   Csa  and  BSh , [130] [131]  with very mild winters (on the coast) and warm to hot summers. Snow is possible only in the Troodos Mountains in the central part of island. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry. \n Cyprus has one of the warmest climates in the Mediterranean part of the European Union. [ citation needed ]  The average annual temperature on the coast is around 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. Generally, summers last about eight months, beginning in April with average temperatures of 21\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201373\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 11\u201313\u00a0\u00b0C (52\u201355\u00a0\u00b0F) at night, and ending in November with average temperatures of 22\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u201373\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 12\u201314\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u201357\u00a0\u00b0F) at night, although in the remaining four months temperatures sometimes exceed 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). [132] \n Among all cities in the Mediterranean part of the European Union, Limassol has one of the warmest winters, in the period January \u2013 February average temperature is 17\u201318\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u201364\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 7\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u201346\u00a0\u00b0F) at night, in other coastal locations in Cyprus is generally 16\u201317\u00a0\u00b0C (61\u201363\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 6\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u201346\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. During March, Limassol has average temperatures of 19\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C (66\u201368\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 9\u201311\u00a0\u00b0C (48\u201352\u00a0\u00b0F) at night, in other coastal locations in Cyprus is generally 17\u201319\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u201366\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 8\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C (46\u201350\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. [132] \nThe Troodos Mountains experience heavy snowfall in winter \n The middle of summer is hot \u2013 in July and August on the coast the average temperature is usually around 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and around 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F) at night (inland, in the highlands average temperature exceeds 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F)) while in the June and September on the coast the average temperature is usually around 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and around 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) at night in Limassol, while is usually around 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and around 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F) at night in Paphos. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. Inland temperatures are more extreme, with colder winters and hotter summers compared with the coast of the island. [132] \n Average annual temperature of sea is 21\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201372\u00a0\u00b0F), from 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) in February to 27\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F) in August (depending on the location). In total 7 months \u2013 from May to November \u2013 the average sea temperature exceeds 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). [133] \n Sunshine hours on the coast are around 3,200 per year, from an average of 5\u20136 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12\u201313 hours in July. [133]  This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe; for comparison, London receives about 1,540 per year. [134]  In December, London receives about 50 hours of sunshine [134]  while coastal locations in Cyprus about 180 hours (almost as much as in May in London). \n Water supply \nThe Kaledonia Falls in the  Troodos Mountains \n Kouris Dam  overflow in April 2012 \n Cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased. [135]  Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005. However, since then demand has increased annually \u2013 a result of local population growth, foreigners moving to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists \u2013 while supply has fallen as a result of more frequent droughts. [135] \n Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use; Cyprus has a total of 107 dams (plus one currently under construction) and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about 330,000,000\u00a0m 3  (1.2 \u00d7 10 10 \u00a0cu\u00a0ft). [136]  Water  desalination  plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought. The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity. \n Turkey is building a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from  Anamur  on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water  (see  Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project ) . \n Politics \n Main articles:  Politics of Cyprus  and  House of Representatives (Cyprus) \n Presidential Palace, Nicosia \n Nicos Anastasiades , President of Cyprus since 2013. \n Cyprus is a  presidential republic . The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of  universal suffrage  for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature. \n The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls. \n Since 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the  Turkish Cypriot  seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided  de facto  when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  but were recognised only by  Turkey . In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus. \n The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by  proportional representation  and 3 observer members representing the  Armenian ,  Latin  and  Maronite  minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the  Turkish  community but remain vacant since 1964. The political environment is dominated by the communist  AKEL , the liberal conservative  Democratic Rally , the  centrist [137]   Democratic Party , the  social-democratic   EDEK  and the centrist  EURO.KO . In 2008,  Dimitris Christofias  became the country's first Communist head of state. Due to his involvement in the  2012\u201313 Cypriot financial crisis , Christofias did not run for re-election in 2013. The Presidential election in 2013 resulted in  Democratic Rally  candidate  Nicos Anastasiades  winning 57.48% of the vote. As a result, Anastasiades was sworn in on and has been President since 28 February 2013. \n Administrative divisions \n Main articles:  Districts of Cyprus  and  List of cities, towns and villages in Cyprus \n The Republic of Cyprus is divided into six districts:  Nicosia ,  Famagusta ,  Kyrenia ,  Larnaca ,  Limassol  and  Paphos . [138] \n Nicosia \n Limassol \n Larnaca \n Paphos \n Famagusta \n Kyrenia \n Exclaves and enclaves \n Dhekelia Power Station \n Cyprus has four  exclaves , all in territory that belongs to the  British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia . The first two are the villages of  Ormidhia  and  Xylotymvou . The third is the  Dhekelia Power Station , which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is the  EAC  refugee settlement. The southern part, even though located by the sea, is also an exclave because it has no  territorial waters  of its own, those being U.K. waters. [139] \n The  UN buffer zone  runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off  Ayios Nikolaos  and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the  Paralimni  area on the southeast corner of the island into a  de facto , though not  de jure , exclave. \n Foreign relations \n Main article:  Foreign relations of Cyprus \n The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the following international groups:  Australia Group ,  CN ,  CE ,  CFSP ,  EBRD ,  EIB ,  EU ,  FAO ,  IAEA ,  IBRD ,  ICAO ,  ICC ,  ICCt ,  ITUC ,  IDA ,  IFAD ,  IFC ,  IHO ,  ILO ,  IMF ,  IMO ,  Interpol ,  IOC ,  IOM ,  IPU ,  ITU ,  MIGA ,  NAM ,  NSG ,  OPCW ,  OSCE ,  PCA ,  UN ,  UNCTAD ,  UNESCO ,  UNHCR ,  UNIDO ,  UPU ,  WCL ,  WCO ,  WFTU ,  WHO ,  WIPO ,  WMO ,  WToO ,  WTO .

[142] \n In \"Freedom in the World 2011\", Freedom House rated Cyprus as \"free\". [143]  In January 2011, the Report of the Office of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  on the question of Human Rights in Cyprus noted that the ongoing division of Cyprus continues to affect human rights throughout the island \"...\u00a0including freedom of movement, human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons, discrimination, the right to life, freedom of religion, and economic, social and cultural rights.\" [144]  The constant focus on the division of the island can sometimes mask other human rights issues. [ citation needed ] \n In 2014, Turkey was ordered by the  European Court of Human Rights  to pay well over $100m in compensation to Cyprus for the invasion; [145]   Ankara  announced that it would ignore the judgment. [146]  In 2014, a group of Cypriot refugees and a European parliamentarian, later joined by the Cypriot government, filed a complaint to the International Court of Justice, accusing Turkey of violating the  Geneva Conventions  by directly or indirectly transferring its civilian population into occupied territory. [147]  Over the preceding ten years, civilian transfer by Turkey had \"reached new heights\", in the words of one US ambassador. [h] [148]  Other violations of the Geneva and the Hague Conventions\u2014both ratified by Turkey\u2014amount to what archaeologist Sophocles Hadjisavvas called \"the organized destruction of Greek and Christian heritage in the north\". [149]  These violations include looting of cultural treasures, deliberate destruction of churches, neglect of works of art, and altering the names of important historical sites, which was condemned by the  International Council on Monuments and Sites . Hadjisavvas has asserted that these actions are motivated by a Turkish policy of erasing the Greek presence in Northern Cyprus within a framework of ethnic cleansing, as well as by greed and profit-seeking on the part of the individuals involved. [149] \n Armed forces \nWelcoming ceremony by soldiers of the  Cypriot National Guard \n Main article:  Cypriot National Guard \n The  Cypriot National Guard  is the main military institution of the Republic of Cyprus. It is a  combined arms  force, with land, air and naval elements. Historically all men were required to spend 24 months serving in the National Guard after their 17th birthday, but in 2016 this period of compulsory service was reduced to 14 months. The land forces of the Cypriot National Guard comprise the following units: \n First Infantry Division (I\u03b7 \u039c\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a0\u0396) \n Second Infantry Division (II\u03b1 \u039c\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a0\u0396) \n Fourth Infantry Brigade (IV\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a0\u0396) \n Twentieth Armoured Brigade (XX\u03b7 \u03a4\u0398 \u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) \n Third Support Brigade (III\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a5\u03a0) \n Eighth Support Brigade (VIII\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a5\u03a0) \n The air force includes the 449th Helicopter Gunship Squadron (449 \u039c\u0391\u0395) \u2013 operating  A\u00e9rospatiale SA-342L  and  Bell 206  and the 450th Helicopter Gunship Squadron (450 ME/P) \u2013 operating  Mi-35P  helicopters and the  Britten-Norman BN-2B  and  Pilatus PC-9  fixed-wing aircraft. Current senior officers include Supreme Commander, Cypriot National Guard, Lt. General Stylianos Nasis, [150]  and Chief of Staff, Cypriot National Guard: Maj. General Michalis Flerianos. [ citation needed ]  The  Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion , which occurred on 11 July 2011, was the most deadly military accident ever recorded in Cyprus. \n Economy \n Main article:  Economy of Cyprus \n Central Bank of Cyprus \n In the early 21st century the Cypriot economy has diversified and become prosperous. [151]  However, in 2012 it became affected by the  Eurozone financial and banking crisis . In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need \u20ac 1.8 billion  in foreign aid to support the  Cyprus Popular Bank , and this was followed by  Fitch  downgrading Cyprus's credit rating to  junk status . [152]  Fitch said Cyprus would need an additional \u20ac 4 billion  to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of  Bank of Cyprus , Cyprus Popular Bank and  Hellenic Bank , Cyprus's three largest banks, to the  Greek financial crisis . [152] \nCyprus is part of a monetary union, the  eurozone  (dark blue) and of the  EU single market . \n The  2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis  led to an agreement with the  Eurogroup  in March 2013 to split the country's second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), into a \"bad\" bank which would be wound down over time and a \"good\" bank which would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus. In return for a \u20ac10\u00a0billion  bailout  from the  European Commission , the  European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund , often referred to as the \"troika\", the Cypriot government was required to impose a significant  haircut  on  uninsured deposits , a large proportion of which were held by wealthy  Russians  who used Cyprus as a  tax haven . Insured deposits of \u20ac100,000 or less were not affected. [153] [154] [155] \nLimassol General Hospital \n According to the 2017 International Monetary Fund estimates, its  per capita GDP  (adjusted for  purchasing power ) at  $ 36,442 is below the average of the European Union. [156] [157]  Cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates. Tourism, financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy. Economic policy of the Cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union. The Cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 January 2008. [151] \n In recent years significant quantities of offshore  natural gas  have been discovered in the area known as  Aphrodite  (at the exploratory drilling block 12) in Cyprus' exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ), [158]  about 175 kilometres (109 miles) south of Limassol at 33\u00b05\u203240\u2033N and 32\u00b059\u20320\u2033E. [159]  However, Turkey's offshore drilling companies have accessed both natural gas and  oil  resources since 2013. [160]  Cyprus demarcated its maritime border with  Egypt  in 2003, and with  Lebanon  in 2007. [161]  Cyprus and Israel demarcated their maritime border in 2010, [162]  and in August 2011, the US-based firm  Noble Energy  entered into a production-sharing agreement with the Cypriot government regarding the block's commercial development. [163] \n Turkey , which does not recognise the border agreements of Cyprus with its neighbours, [164]  threatened to mobilise its naval forces if Cyprus proceeded with plans to begin drilling at Block 12. [165]  Cyprus' drilling efforts have the support of the US, EU, and UN, and on 19 September 2011 drilling in Block 12 began without any incidents being reported. [166] \n Because of the heavy influx of tourists and foreign investors, the property rental market in Cyprus has grown in recent years. [ when? ] [167]  In late 2013, the Cyprus Town Planning Department announced a series of incentives to stimulate the property market and increase the number of property developments in the country's town centres. [168]  This followed earlier measures to quickly give immigration permits to third country nationals investing in Cyprus property.

Of the 10,663\u00a0km (6,626\u00a0mi) of roads in the Republic of Cyprus in 1998, 6,249\u00a0km (3,883\u00a0mi) were paved, and 4,414\u00a0km (2,743\u00a0mi) were unpaved. In 1996 the Turkish-occupied area had a similar ratio of paved to unpaved, with approximately 1,370\u00a0km (850\u00a0mi) of paved road and 980\u00a0km (610\u00a0mi) unpaved. [ citation needed ]  Cyprus is one of only four EU nations in which vehicles drive on the  left-hand side of the road , a remnant of British colonisation (the others being  Ireland ,  Malta  and the  United Kingdom ).  A series of motorways  runs along the coast from Paphos east to Ayia Napa, with two motorways running inland to Nicosia, one from Limassol and one from Larnaca. \n Per capita private car ownership is the 29th-highest in the world. [170]  There were approximately 344,000 privately owned vehicles, and a total of 517,000 registered motor vehicles in the Republic of Cyprus in 2006. [171]  In 2006, plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and other public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the  European Union  Development Bank. In 2010 the new bus network was implemented. [172] \n Cyprus has several heliports and two international airports:  Larnaca International Airport  and  Paphos International Airport . A third airport,  Ercan International Airport , operates in the Turkish Cypriot administered area with direct flights only to  Turkey  (Turkish Cypriot ports are closed to international traffic apart from Turkey).  Nicosia International Airport  has been closed since 1974. \n The main  harbours  of the island are  Limassol  and  Larnaca , which service cargo, passenger and  cruise ships . \n Communications \n Main article:  Communications in Cyprus \n Cyta , the  state-owned  telecommunications company, manages most telecommunications and Internet connections on the island. However, following deregulation of the sector, a few private telecommunications companies emerged, including  MTN ,  Cablenet ,  OTEnet Telecom ,  Omega Telecom  and  PrimeTel . In the Turkish-controlled area of Cyprus, three different companies are present:  Turkcell ,  KKTC Telsim  and  Turk Telekom . \n Demographics \n Main article:  Demographics of Cyprus \nPopulation growth, 1961\u20132003 (numbers for the entire island, excluding Turkish settlers residing in Northern Cyprus). \n2010 population by age and gender \n According to the CIA World Factbook, in 2001  Greek Cypriots  comprised 77%,  Turkish Cypriots  18%, and others 5% of the Cypriot population. [173]  At the time of the 2011 government census, there were 10,520 people of  Russian  origin living in Cyprus. [174] [175] [176] [177] \n According to the first population census after the declaration of independence, carried out in December 1960 and covering the entire island, Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turkish, and 27,108 (4.7%) others. [89] [178] \n Due to the inter-communal ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974, an island-wide census was regarded as impossible. Nevertheless, the Cypriot government conducted one in 1973, without the Turkish Cypriot populace. [179]  According to this census, the Greek Cypriot population was 482,000. One year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the total population of Cyprus at 641,000; of whom 506,000 (78.9%) were Greeks, and 118,000 (18.4%) Turkish. [180]  After the partition of the island in 1974, the government of Cyprus conducted four more censuses: in 1976, 1982, 1992 and 2001; these excluded the Turkish population which was resident in the northern part of the island. [178] \n According to the Republic of Cyprus's latest estimate, in 2005, the number of Cypriot citizens currently living in the Republic of Cyprus is around 871,036. In addition to this, the Republic of Cyprus is home to 110,200 foreign permanent residents [181]  and an estimated 10,000\u201330,000 undocumented illegal immigrants currently living in the south of the island.

Of the 147,405 citizens born in Cyprus, 120,031 say both parents were born in Cyprus; 16,824 say both parents born in Turkey; 10,361 have one parent born in Turkey and one parent born in Cyprus. [183] \n In 2010, the  International Crisis Group  estimated that the total population of Cyprus was 1.1\u00a0million, [184]  of which there was an estimated 300,000 residents in the north, perhaps half of whom were either born in Turkey or are children of such settlers. [185] \n The villages of Potamia (Nicosia district) and  Pyla  in the  Larnaca District  are the only settlements in the Republic of Cyprus with a mixed Greek and Turkish Cypriot population. [ citation needed ] \n Y-Dna haplogroups  are found at the following frequencies in Cyprus:  J  (43.07% including 6.20% J1),  E1b1b  (20.00%),  R1  (12.30% including 9.2% R1b),  F  (9.20%),  I  (7.70%),  K  (4.60%),  A  (3.10%). [186]  J, K, F and E1b1b haplogroups consist of lineages with differential distribution within Middle East, North Africa and Europe while R1 and I are typical in West European populations. \n Outside Cyprus there is a significant and thriving  Greek Cypriot diaspora  and  Turkish Cypriot diaspora  in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States, Greece and  Turkey . \n \u00a0 \n v \n t \n e \n Largest municipalities in Cyprus \n CYstat\u00a0\u2013  Population\u00a0\u2014 Place of Residence, 2011  (Cyprus Census 2011)  (sheet C1);  DP\u00d6\u00a0\u2013Northern Cyprus 2011 Population and Housing Census \n Rank \n Name \n District \n Pop. \n Nicosia (north and south) \n Limassol \n 1 \n Nicosia (north and south) \n Nicosia \n 200,452 \n Strovolos \n Larnaca \n 2 \n Limassol \n Limassol \n 154,000 \n 3 \n Strovolos \n Nicosia \n 67,904 \n 4 \n Larnaca \n Larnaca \n 51,468 \n 5 \n Famagusta \n Famagusta \n 42,526 \n 6 \n Lakatamia \n Nicosia \n 38,435 \n 7 \n Kyrenia \n Kyrenia \n 33,207 \n 8 \n Paphos \n Paphos \n 32,892 \n 9 \n Kato Polemidhia \n Limassol \n 22,369 \n 10 \n Aglandjia \n Nicosia \n 20,783 \n Functional urban areas \n Functional urban areas \n Population (2016) [187] \n Nicosia \n 330,000 \n Limassol \n 237,000 \n Religion \n Main article:  Religion in Cyprus \n Kykkos Monastery  in  Pedoulas  (left) and  Hala Sultan Tekke  near  Larnaca Salt Lake  (right). \n Religion in Cyprus  ( Pew Research ) [188] [189] \n religion \n percent \n Eastern Orthodoxy \n \u2009 \n 78% \n Islam \n \u2009 \n 20% \n Other \n \u2009 \n 1% \n None \n \u2009 \n 1% \n The majority of Greek Cypriots identify as  Greek Orthodox , [189] [190] [191]  whereas most Turkish Cypriots are adherents of  Sunni Islam . According to Eurobarometer 2005, [192]  Cyprus was the second most religious state in the European Union at that time, after Malta (although in 2005  Romania  wasn't in the European Union; currently Romania is the most religious state in the  European Union )  (see  Religion in the European Union ) . The first  President of Cyprus ,  Makarios III , was an  archbishop . The current leader of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus is Archbishop  Chrysostomos II . \n Hala Sultan Tekke , situated near the  Larnaca Salt Lake , is considered by some secular orientalists as the third holiest site in Sunni Islam [193] [194]  and an object of  pilgrimage  for both Muslims [195]  and Christians. [196] \n According to the 2001 census carried out in the Government-controlled area, [197]  94.8% of the population are  Eastern Orthodox , 0.9%  Armenians  and  Maronites , 1.5% Roman Catholics, 1.0%  Church of England , and 0.6% Muslims. There is also a  Jewish community on Cyprus . The remaining 1.3% adhere to other religious denominations or did not state their religion. \n Languages \n Main article:  Languages of Cyprus \nThe Armenian Alphabet at the  Melkonian Educational Institute .  Armenian  is recognised as a minority language in Cyprus. \nCyprus road signs in Greek and English. An estimate of 87% of the Cypriot population speaks English. \n Cyprus has two official languages,  Greek  and  Turkish . [198]   Armenian  and  Cypriot Maronite Arabic  are recognised as minority languages. [199] [200]  Although without official status,  English  is widely spoken and it features widely on road signs, public notices, and in advertisements, etc. [201]  English was the sole official language during British colonial rule and the  lingua franca  until 1960, and continued to be used ( de facto ) in courts of law until 1989 and in legislation until 1996. [202]  80.4% of Cypriots are proficient in the English language as a  second language . [203]   Russian  is widely spoken among the country's minorities, residents and citizens of post-Soviet countries, and  Pontic Greeks . Russian, after English and Greek, is the third language used on many signs of shops and restaurants, particularly in Limassol and Paphos. In addition to these languages, 12% speak French and 5% speak German. [204] \n The everyday spoken language of Greek Cypriots is  Cypriot Greek  and that of Turkish Cypriots is  Cypriot Turkish . [202]  These  vernaculars  both differ from their  standard registers  significantly. [202] \n Education \n Main article:  Education in Cyprus \n Faneromeni School  is the oldest all-girl primary school in Cyprus. \n Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education. The high quality of instruction can be attributed in part to the fact that nearly 7% of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden. [205] \n State schools  are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions. However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take. \n The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities. It is noteworthy that Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of  working age  who have higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In addition, 47% of its population aged 25\u201334 have tertiary education, which is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus. \n Culture \nThe entrance of the historic  Pancyprian Gymnasium \n Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots share a lot in common in their culture but also have differences. Several traditional food (such as  souvla  and  halloumi ) and beverages are similar, as well as expressions and ways of life. Hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both. In both communities, music, dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic, verbal and nonverbal expressions, traditional dances such as  tsifteteli , similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities. [206]  However, the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures, with the Greek Cypriots traditionally being  Greek Orthodox  and Turkish Cypriots traditionally being  Sunni Muslims , which has partly hindered cultural exchange. [207]  Greek Cypriots have influences from  Greece  and  Christianity , while Turkish Cypriots have influences from  Turkey  and  Islam . \n The  Limassol Carnival Festival  is an annual  carnival  which is held at  Limassol , in Cyprus. The event which is very popular in Cyprus was introduced in the 20th century. [208] \n Arts \nTypical Cypriot architecture in old part of  Nicosia , Cyprus \n The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10,000 years, following the discovery of a series of  Chalcolithic  period carved figures in the villages of  Khoirokoitia  and  Lempa . [209]  The island is the home to numerous examples of high quality religious  icon painting  from the  Middle Ages  as well as  many painted churches . Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by  French Gothic  and Italian  renaissance  introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191\u20131571). \n In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883\u20131958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice. [210]  Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900\u20131994) who studied at London's  Royal College of Art  and Christopheros Savva (1924\u20131968) who also studied in London, at  Saint Martin's School of Art . [211]  In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England [212]  while others train at art schools in  Greece  and local art institutions such as the  Cyprus College of Art ,  University of Nicosia  and the  Frederick Institute of Technology . \n One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although  conceptual art  is being rigorously promoted by a number of art \"institutions\" and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre. Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene. Cyprus was due to host the international art festival  Manifesta  in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital  Nicosia . [213] [214] \n Other notable Greek Cypriot artists include  Helene Black ,  Kalopedis family , Panayiotis Kalorkoti,  Nicos Nicolaides ,  Stass Paraskos ,  Arest\u00eds Stas\u00ed ,  Telemachos Kanthos ,  Konstantia Sofokleous  and  Chris Achilleos , and Turkish Cypriot artists include  \u0130smet G\u00fcney ,  Ruzen Atakan  and  Mutlu \u00c7erkez . \n Music \n Main article:  Music of Cyprus \nProminent Cypriot pop singer  Michalis Hatzigiannis \n Laouto , dominant instrument of the Cypriot traditional music. \n The traditional  folk music  of Cyprus has several common elements with  Greek ,  Turkish , and  Arabic Music  including Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot dances such as the  sousta ,  syrtos ,  zeibekikos ,  tatsia , and  karsilamas  as well as the Middle Eastern-inspired  tsifteteli  and  arapies . There is also a form of musical poetry known as  chattista  which is often performed at traditional feasts and celebrations. The instruments commonly associated with Cyprus folk music are the  violin  (\"fkiolin\"),  lute  (\"laouto\"),  accordion , Cyprus  flute  ( pithkiavlin ),  oud  (\"outi\") and percussions (including the \" toumperleki \"). Composers associated with traditional Cypriot music include  Solon Michaelides ,  Marios Tokas , Evagoras Karageorgis and Savvas Salides. Among musicians is also the acclaimed pianist  Cyprien Katsaris  and composer and artistic director of the European Capital of Culture initiative  Marios Joannou Elia . \n Popular music  in Cyprus is generally influenced by the Greek  La\u00efka  scene; artists who play in this genre include international  platinum  star  Anna Vissi , [215] [216] [217] [218]   Evridiki , and  Sarbel .  Hip Hop ,  R&B  and  reggae  have been supported by the emergence of Cypriot  rap  and the  urban music  scene at  Ayia Napa . Cypriot rock music and  \u00c9ntekhno  rock is often associated with artists such as  Michalis Hatzigiannis  and  Alkinoos Ioannidis .  Metal  also has a small following in Cyprus represented by bands such as Armageddon (rev.16:16), Blynd,  Winter's Verge ,  Methysos  and Quadraphonic. \n Literature \n Main article:  Cypriot literature \n Zeno of Citium , founder of the  Stoic  school of philosophy. \n Literary production of the antiquity includes the  Cypria , an  epic poem , probably composed in the late 7th century BC and attributed to  Stasinus . The Cypria is one of the very first specimens of Greek and European poetry. [219]  The Cypriot  Zeno of Citium  was the founder of the Stoic School of Philosophy. \n Ioannis Kigalas  (c. 1622\u20131687) was a  Nicosia  born  Greek  Cypriot scholar and professor of Philosophy who was largely active in the 17th century. [220] \n Epic poetry, notably the \"acritic songs\", flourished during  Middle Ages . Two chronicles, one written by  Leontios Machairas  and the other by Georgios Voustronios, cover the entire Middle Ages until the end of Frankish rule (4th century\u20131489). Po\u00e8mes d'amour written in medieval Greek Cypriot date back from the 16th century. Some of them are actual translations of poems written by  Petrarch ,  Bembo ,  Ariosto  and G.  Sannazzaro . [221]  Many Cypriot scholars fled Cyprus at troubled times such as  Ioannis Kigalas  (c. 1622\u20131687) who migrated from Cyprus to Italy in the 17th century, several of his works have survived in books of other scholars. [222] \n Hasan Hilmi Efendi, a Turkish Cypriot poet, was rewarded by the Ottoman sultan  Mahmud II  and said to be the \"sultan of the poems\". [223] \n Modern Greek Cypriot literary figures include the poet and writer  Kostas Montis , poet  Kyriakos Charalambides , poet  Michalis Pasiardis , writer  Nicos Nicolaides ,  Stylianos Atteshlis ,  Altheides , Loukis Akritas [224]  and Demetris Th. Gotsis.  Dimitris Lipertis ,  Vasilis Michaelides  and Pavlos Liasides are folk poets who wrote poems mainly in the  Cypriot-Greek  dialect. [225] [226]  Among leading Turkish Cypriot writers are  Osman T\u00fcrkay , twice nominated for the  Nobel Prize in Literature , [227]   \u00d6zker Ya\u015f\u0131n ,  Neriman Cahit ,  Urkiye Mine Balman ,  Mehmet Ya\u015f\u0131n  and  Ne\u015fe Ya\u015f\u0131n . \n There is an increasingly strong presence of both temporary and permanent emigre Cypriot writers in world literature, as well as writings by second and third -generation Cypriot writers born or raised abroad, often writing in English. This includes writers such as  Stephen Laughton ,  Michael Paraskos ,  Stel Pavlou  and  Stephanos Stephanides . [228] \n Examples of Cyprus in foreign literature include the works of Shakespeare, with most of the play  Othello  by  William Shakespeare  set on the island of Cyprus. British writer  Lawrence Durrell  lived in Cyprus from 1952 until 1956, during his time working for the British colonial government on the island, and wrote the book  Bitter Lemons  about his time in Cyprus which won the second  Duff Cooper Prize  in 1957. More recently British writer  Victoria Hislop  used Cyprus as the setting for her 2014 novel  The Sunrise. \n Mass media \n Main article:  Media of Cyprus \n Main articles:  Television in Cyprus ,  Radio in Cyprus , and  Cinema of Cyprus \n In the 2015 Freedom of the Press report of  Freedom House , the Republic of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus were ranked \"free\". The Republic of Cyprus scored 25/100 in  press freedom , 5/30 in Legal Environment, 11/40 in Political Environment, and 9/30 in Economic Environment (the lower scores the better). [229]   Reporters Without Borders  rank the Republic of Cyprus 24th out of 180 countries in the 2015 World Press Freedom Index, with a score of 15.62 [230] \n The law provides for  freedom of speech  and  press , and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. [231] \n Local television companies in Cyprus include the state owned  Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  which runs two television channels. In addition on the Greek side of the island there are the private channels ANT1 Cyprus, Plus TV, Mega Channel, Sigma TV, Nimonia TV (NTV) and New Extra. In Northern Cyprus, the local channels are  BRT , the Turkish Cypriot equivalent to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, and a number of private channels. The majority of local arts and cultural programming is produced by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and BRT, with local arts documentaries, review programmes and filmed drama series. \n Cinema \n Main article:  Cinema of Cyprus \n The most worldwide known Cypriot director, to have worked abroad, is  Michael Cacoyannis . \n Cypriot cinema was born much later than that of other countries. In the late 1960s and early 1970s,  George Filis  produced and directed  Gregoris Afxentiou ,  Etsi Prodothike i Kypros  ( Cyprus Betrayal ), and  The Mega Document . \n In 1994, cinematographic production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. As of the year 2000, the annual amount set aside in the national budget stands at Cy Pounds 500,000 (about 850,000 Euros). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the  Council of Europe 's Eurimages Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature-length films in which a Cypriot was executive producer have received funding from  Eurimages . The first was  I Sphagi tou Kokora  (1992), completed in 1996,  Hellados  ( And the Trains Fly to the Sky , 1995), which is currently in post-production, and  Costas Demetriou 's  O Dromos gia tin Ithaki  ( The Road to Ithaka , 1997) which premiered in March 2000. The theme song to  The Road to Ithaka  was composed by  Costas Cacoyannis  and sung by  Alexia Vassiliou . In September 1999,  To Tama  ( The Promise ) by  Andreas Pantzis  also received funding from the Eurimages Fund. [232]  In 2009 the Greek director, writer and producer  Vassilis Mazomenos  filmed in Cyprus  Guilt . The film was awarded in 2012 with the Best Screenwriting and Best Photography award in  London Greek Film Festival  (UK) and was official selection in  Montreal World Film Festival ,  Cairo International Film Festival ,  India International Film Festival ,  Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival ,  Fantasporto  and opening film in the Panorama of European Cinema in Athens. In 2010 the film was Nominated for the best film from the  Hellenic Film Academy . \n Only a small number of foreign films have been made in Cyprus. This includes  Incense for the Damned , filmed in 1969 and starring  Patrick Macnee ,  Patrick Mower  and  Peter Cushing . In 1970  The Beloved , starring  Raquel Welch  was also filmed in Cyprus, as was the 1973 British comedy movie  Ghost in the Noonday Sun , directed by  Peter Medak , starring  Peter Sellers ,  Anthony Franciosa  and  Spike Milligan . [233]  Parts of the 1962 film  The Longest Day , starring  John Wayne  were also filmed on Cyprus. \n Cuisine \n Main article:  Cypriot cuisine \nCypriot  meze \n Halloumi  cheese originated in Cyprus [234] [235]  and was initially made during the Medieval  Byzantine  period. [236]  Halloumi (Hellim) is commonly served sliced, either fresh or grilled, as an appetiser. \nCypriot  Halloumi \nCypriot style caf\u00e9 in an arcade in  Nicosia \n Seafood and fish dishes include squid, octopus,  red mullet , and  sea bass . Cucumber and tomato are used widely in salads. Common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley, pickled cauliflower and beets, asparagus and  taro . Other traditional delicacies of are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as  lountza  (smoked  pork loin ), charcoal-grilled lamb,  souvlaki  (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and  sheftalia  (minced meat wrapped in  mesentery ).  Pourgouri  ( bulgur , cracked wheat) is the traditional source of carbohydrate other than bread, and is used to make the delicacy  koubes . \n Fresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients. Frequently used vegetables include courgettes, green peppers,  okra , green beans, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and grape leaves, and pulses such as beans, broad beans, peas, black-eyed beans, chick-peas and lentils. The most common fruits and nuts are pears, apples, grapes, oranges,  mandarines , nectarines,  medlar , blackberries, cherry, strawberries, figs, watermelon, melon, avocado, lemon, pistachio, almond, chestnut, walnut, and hazelnut. \n Cyprus is also well known for its desserts, including  lokum  (also known as  Turkish Delight ) and  Soutzoukos . [237]  This island has  protected geographical indication (PGI)  for its  lokum  produced in the village of  Geroskipou .
