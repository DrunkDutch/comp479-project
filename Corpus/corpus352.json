The System Restore function on Windows 7 allows you to roll back your computer to a previous time before the problem or issue occurred. There are a number of reasons why you might want to use System Restore, including if you've had problems installing a new operating system, driver, or piece of software. \n Steps Edit \n Method One of Two: Performing a System Restore Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/24\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/24\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-1-Version-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Understand what System Restore does.  Whenever a change is made to your computer, Windows will create a System Restore point. The is essentially a snapshot of your computer before the change was made (program installation or uninstallation, driver update, etc.). If something goes wrong because of the change you made, you can use the System Restore point to roll your system back without losing your files.\n While a system restore shouldn't affect your personal files, it never hurts to have a recent backup in case something goes wrong.

Windows will suggest a restore point, which will usually be the most recent one. If you need to select an older restore point, click  Next > .\n Check the \"Show more restore points\" box to see all the available restore points. There may not be many to choose from, as Windows automatically deletes older restore points to save space. \n Each restore point will have a short description of what occurred to cause the restore point to be created. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f6\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f6\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 5 \n Click the  . Scan for affected programs   button after selecting a restore point.  This will show you all of the programs and drivers that will be uninstalled or reinstalled by performing the restore with that restore point.\n Any programs installed after the restore point was created will be uninstalled, while any programs uninstalled after the restore point was created will be reinstalled. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d1\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d1\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 6 \n Review the restore point before restoring.  Before proceeding with the system restore, review the changes one last time. Click  Finish  to begin the restore process.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f6\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f6\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 7 \n Wait for the restore process to complete.

This will likely take a few minutes.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 8 \n Confirm that the restore was successful.  Once the restore is complete, Windows will boot and a message will appear indicating that the restore was successful. Test your computer to see if the restore fixed your problem. If it didn't you can try restoring to an earlier restore point. [1] \n If the System Restore made things worse, or you want to go back to how your computer was, you can undo the most recent restore by launching the System Restore tool again and selecting \"Undo System Restore\". \n Advertisement \n Troubleshooting Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ad\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ad\\/Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows-7-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Ensure that System Restore is enabled.

If it doesn't start up at all but the PC works, then you should probably try installing Windows again. If your PC doesn't start up at all, but still lights up, then the problem could be your GPU, RAM, PSU or even your motherboard. If you're trying to open it but it doesn't do anything, then check if your computer is connected properly. After that, check if your PSU is dead or not.  \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 0 \n Ask a Question \n 200 characters left \n Submit \n Video Edit \n Warnings Edit \n Make sure to save all your open files and close all programs.
