[8]  The  principality  is a  constitutional monarchy  headed by the  Prince of Liechtenstein . \n Liechtenstein is bordered by  Switzerland  to the west and south and  Austria  to the east and north. It has an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles), the  fourth-smallest in Europe , and an estimated population of 37,000. Divided into  11 municipalities , its capital is  Vaduz  and its largest municipality is  Schaan . \n Economically, Liechtenstein has one of the  highest gross domestic products per person in the world  when adjusted for  purchasing power parity , [9]  and the highest  when not adjusted by purchasing power parity . The  unemployment rate  is one of the lowest in the world at 1.5%. Liechtenstein has been known in the past as a billionaire tax haven; however, it is no longer on any blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries (see  taxation section ). \n An  alpine country , Liechtenstein is mainly mountainous, making it a  winter sport  destination. Many cultivated fields and small farms are found both in the south (Oberland,  upper land ) and north (Unterland,  lower land ). The country has a strong  financial sector  centered in Vaduz. Liechtenstein is a member of the  United Nations ,  European Free Trade Association , and the  Council of Europe , and while not being a member of the European Union, the country participates in both the  Schengen Area  and  European Economic Area . It also has a  customs union  and a  monetary union  with Switzerland. \n Contents \n 1   History \n 1.1   Early history \n 1.2   Foundation of a dynasty \n 1.3   Principality \n 1.4   20th century \n 1.5   Financial centre \n 2   Government \n 2.1   New constitution \n 2.2   International awards \n 3   Geography \n 4   Economy \n 4.1   Taxation \n 5   Demographics \n 5.1   Languages \n 5.2   Religion \n 6   Education \n 7   Transport \n 8   Culture \n 9   Media \n 10   Sports \n 10.1   Youth \n 11   Security and defence \n 12   See also \n 13   References \n 14   External links \n History [ edit ] \n Main article:  History of Liechtenstein \n Gutenberg Castle , Balzers, Liechtenstein. \n Vaduz Castle , overlooking the capital, is home to the  Prince of Liechtenstein \n Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein  from 1805 to 1806 and 1814 to 1836. \n Early history [ edit ] \n The oldest traces of human existence in Liechtenstein date back to the  Middle Paleolithic  era. [10]   Neolithic  farming settlements were initially founded in the valleys around 5300 BCE. \n The  Hallstatt  and  La T\u00e8ne cultures  flourished during the late  Iron Age , from around 450 BCE\u2014possibly under some influence of both the  Greek  and  Etruscan  civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the  Helvetii . In 58 BCE, at the  Battle of Bibracte ,  Julius Caesar  defeated the Alpine tribes, therefore bringing the region under close control of the  Roman Empire . By 15 BCE,  Tiberius \u2014destined to be the second Roman emperor\u2014with his brother,  Drusus , conquered the entirety of the Alpine area. Liechtenstein was then integrated into the  Roman province  of  Raetia . The area was maintained by the Roman military, who also maintained large legionary camps at  Brigantium  (Austria), near  Lake Constance , and at  Magia  (Swiss). A  Roman road  ran through the territory was also created and maintained by these groups. In 259/60 Brigantium was destroyed by the  Alemanni , a  Germanic people  who settled in the area in around 450 CE. \n In the  Early Middle Ages , the  Alemanni  settled the eastern  Swiss plateau  by the 5th century and the  valleys of the Alps  by the end of the 8th century, with Liechtenstein located at the eastern edge of Alemannia. In the 6th century, the entire region became part of the  Frankish Empire  following  Clovis I 's victory over the Alemanni at  Tolbiac  in 504. [11] [12] \n The area that later became Liechtenstein remained under Frankish hegemony ( Merovingian  and  Carolingian  dynasties), until the empire was divided by the  Treaty of Verdun  in 843\u00a0AD, following the death of  Charlemagne . [10]  The territory of present-day Liechtenstein was under the possession of  East Francia . It would later be reunified with  Middle Francia  under the  Holy Roman Empire , around 1000 CE. [10]  Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was  Romansch , but thereafter  German  began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300, an Alemannic population\u2014the Walsers, who originated in  Valais \u2014entered the region and settled. The mountain village of  Triesenberg  still preserves features of Walser dialect into the present century. [13] \n Foundation of a dynasty [ edit ] \n By 1200, dominions across the Alpine plateau were controlled by the Houses of  Savoy ,  Z\u00e4hringer ,  Habsburg , and  Kyburg . Other regions were accorded the  Imperial immediacy  that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264, the Habsburgs under  King Rudolph I  (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) extended their territory to the eastern Alpine plateau that included the territory of Liechtenstein. [11]  This region was  enfeoffed  to the  Counts of Hohenems  until the creation of the  Liechtenstein dynasty  in 1699. \n In 1396 Vaduz (the southern region of Liechtenstein) was raised to the status of \"imperial immediacy\" and as such made subject to the Holy Roman Emperor alone. [14] \n The family, from which the principality takes its name, originally came from  Liechtenstein Castle  in Lower Austria which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century (and again from 1807 onwards). The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in  Moravia ,  Lower Austria ,  Silesia , and  Styria . As these territories were all held in  feudal tenure  from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the  Habsburgs , the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet ( parliament ), the  Reichstag . Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire. \n For this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as  unmittelbar  (immediate) or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the  Holy Roman Emperor . During the early 17th century  Karl I of Liechtenstein  was made a  F\u00fcrst  (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor  Matthias  after siding with him in a political battle.  Hans-Adam I  was allowed to purchase the minuscule  Herrschaft  (\"Lordship\") of  Schellenberg  and county of  Vaduz  (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their  comital  sovereign and the  suzerain  Emperor. \n Principality [ edit ] \n This section  does not  cite  any  sources .  Please help  improve this section  by  adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and  removed .   (January 2017)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n On 23 January 1718, after the lands had been purchased,  Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor , decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of  F\u00fcrstentum  ( principality ) with the name \"Liechtenstein\" in honour of \"[his] true servant,  Anton Florian of Liechtenstein \". It was on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the  Holy Roman Empire . It is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchase that the Princes of Liechtenstein never visited their new principality for almost 100 years. \n By the early 19th century, as a result of the  Napoleonic Wars  in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire came under the effective control of France, following the crushing defeat at  Austerlitz  by  Napoleon  in 1805. Emperor  Francis II  abdicated, ending more than 960 years of feudal government. Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the  Confederation of the Rhine . This political restructuring had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: the historical imperial, legal, and political institutions had been dissolved. The state ceased to owe an obligation to any feudal lord beyond its borders. [15] \n Modern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any  suzerain . From 25 July 1806, when the  Confederation of the Rhine  was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled  protector , the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813. \n Soon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the  German Confederation  (20 June 1815\u00a0\u2013 24 August 1866), which was presided over by the  Emperor of Austria . \n In 1818,  Prince Johann I  granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year  Prince Aloys  became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842. \n Developments during the 19th century included: \n 1836, the first factory, for making ceramics, was opened. \n 1861, the Savings and Loans Bank was founded along with the first cotton-weaving mill. \n 1868, the Liechtenstein Army was disbanded for financial reasons. \n 1872, a railway line between Switzerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was constructed through Liechtenstein. \n 1886, two bridges over the Rhine to Switzerland were built. \n 20th century [ edit ] \n Until the end of  World War I , Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the  Austrian Empire  and later to  Austria-Hungary ; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and they spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna. The economic devastation caused by this war forced the country to conclude a  customs  and  monetary union  with its other neighbour, Switzerland. \n At the time of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was argued that Liechtenstein, as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, was no longer bound to the emerging independent state of  Austria , since the latter did not consider itself as the legal successor to the empire. This is partly contradicted [ original research? ]  by the Liechtenstein perception that the dethroned Austro-Hungarian Emperor still maintained an abstract heritage of the Holy Roman Empire. \n Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein  from 1929 to 1938. \n In 1929, 75-year-old  Prince Franz I  succeeded to the throne. Franz had just married  Elisabeth von Gutmann , a wealthy woman from Vienna whose father was a Jewish businessman from Moravia. Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy movement arose within its National Union party. Local Liechtenstein Nazis identified Elisabeth as their Jewish \"problem\". [16] \n In March 1938, just after the  annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany , Prince Franz named as regent his 31-year-old first cousin twice removed and heir-presumptive,  Prince Franz Joseph . Franz died in July that year, and Franz Joseph succeeded to the throne. Franz Joseph II first moved to Liechtenstein in 1938, a few days after Austria's annexation. [14] \n During  World War II , Liechtenstein remained officially neutral, looking to neighbouring Switzerland for assistance and guidance, while family treasures from dynastic lands and possessions in  Bohemia ,  Moravia , and  Silesia  were taken to Liechtenstein for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict,  Czechoslovakia  and  Poland , acting to seize what they considered to be German possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions. The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the  International Court of Justice ) included over 1,600\u00a0km 2  (618\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed  Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape ), and several family castles and palaces. \n In 2005 it was revealed that Jewish labourers from the  Strasshof   concentration camp , provided by the  SS , had worked on estates in  Austria  owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House. [17] \n Citizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the  Cold War . More recently the diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial post-war  Bene\u0161 decrees  resulted in Liechtenstein not sharing international relations with the  Czech Republic  or  Slovakia . Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009, [18] [19] [20]  and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009. [21] \n Financial centre [ edit ] \n Liechtenstein was in dire financial straits following the end of the war in Europe. The Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, including the portrait \" Ginevra de' Benci \" by  Leonardo da Vinci , which was purchased by the  National Gallery of Art  of the  United States  in 1967 for $5 million ($36 million in 2016 dollars), then a record price for a painting. \n However, by the late 1970s, it used its low  corporate tax  rates to draw many companies to the country, becoming one of the wealthiest countries in the world. \n The  Prince of Liechtenstein  is the world's sixth  wealthiest monarch  with an estimated wealth of 5 billion  USD . [22]  The country's population enjoys one of the  world's highest standards of living . \n Government [ edit ] \nAdministrative divisions of Liechtenstein \nThe centre of government in  Vaduz . \n Main article:  Politics of Liechtenstein \n Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein , as pictured by  Erling Mandelmann  in 1974. \n Liechtenstein has a constitutional monarch as Head of State, and an elected parliament which enacts the law. It is also a direct democracy, where voters can propose and enact constitutional amendments and legislation independent of the legislature. The  Constitution of Liechtenstein  was  adopted in March 2003 , replacing the previous 1921 constitution which had established Liechtenstein as a constitutional monarchy headed by the reigning prince of the Princely House of Liechtenstein. A parliamentary system had been established, although the reigning Prince retained substantial political authority. \n The reigning Prince is the head of state and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations). The Prince may veto laws adopted by parliament. The Prince can call  referenda , propose new legislation, and dissolve parliament, although dissolution of parliament may be subject to a referendum. [23] \n Executive authority is vested in a collegiate government comprising the head of government (prime minister) and four government councilors (ministers). The head of government and the other ministers are appointed by the Prince upon the proposal and concurrence of parliament, thus reflecting the partisan balance of parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two members of the government be chosen from each of the two regions. [24]  The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the Prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government. \n Legislative authority is vested in the unicameral  Landtag  made up of 25 members elected for maximum four-year terms according to a proportional representation formula. Fifteen members are elected from the \"Oberland\" (Upper Country or region) and ten members are elected from the \"Unterland\" (Lower Country or region). [25]  Parties must receive at least 8% of the national vote to win seats in parliament, i.e. enough for 2 seats in the 25-seat legislature. Parliament proposes and approves a government, which is formally appointed by the Prince. Parliament may also pass votes of no confidence in the entire government or individual members. \n Parliament elects from among its members a \"Landesausschuss\" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing parliamentary oversight functions. Parliament can call for referenda on proposed legislation. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the Prince and with the number of citizens required for an initiative referendum. [26] \n Judicial authority is vested in the Regional Court at Vaduz, the Princely High Court of Appeal at Vaduz, the Princely Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the State Court. The State Court rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and has five members elected by parliament. \n On 1 July 1984, Liechtenstein became the last country in Europe to grant women the right to vote. The  referendum on women's suffrage , in which only men were allowed to participate, passed with 51.3% in favour. [27] \n New constitution [ edit ] \n In a  national referendum  in March 2003, nearly two-thirds of the electorate voted in support of Hans-Adam II's proposed new constitution to replace the 1921 version. The proposed constitution was criticised by many, including the  Council of Europe , as expanding the powers of the monarchy (continuing the power to veto any law, and allowing the Prince to dismiss the government or any minister). The Prince threatened that if the constitution failed, he would, among other things, convert some of the royal property for commercial use and move to Austria. [28]  The princely family and the Prince enjoy tremendous public support inside the nation, and the resolution passed with about 64% in favour. [29]  A proposal to revoke the Prince's veto powers was rejected by 76% of voters in a  2012 referendum . [30] \n Few national constitutions provide a right of secession, but municipalities in Liechtenstein are entitled to secede from the union by majority vote. [31] \n International awards [ edit ] \n In the year 2013, Liechtenstein won for the first time a SolarSuperState Prize in the category Solar recognizing the achieved level of the usage of photovoltaics per population within the state territory. [32]  The SolarSuperState Association justified this prize with the cumulative installed photovoltaic power of some 290 Watt per capita at the end of 2012. This level placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in the year 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the 2. SolarSuperState Prize in the category Solar to Liechtenstein. [33]  In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honored with the 1. SolarSuperState Prize in the category Solar because the state had the world biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power per population. [34] [35] \n Geography [ edit ] \n Main article:  Geography of Liechtenstein \nThe  Rhine : border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the  Swiss Alps ). \n Liechtenstein is situated in the Upper  Rhine  valley of the European  Alps  and is bordered to the east by Austria and to the south and west by Switzerland. The entire western border of Liechtenstein is formed by the Rhine. Measured south to north the country is about 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) long. Its highest point, the  Grauspitz , is 2,599\u00a0m (8,527\u00a0ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate of Liechtenstein comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to  winter sports . \n New  surveys  using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160\u00a0km 2  (61.776\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), with borders of 77.9\u00a0km (48.4\u00a0mi). [36]  Thus, it was discovered in 2006 that Liechtenstein's borders are 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) longer than previously thought. [37] \n Liechtenstein is one of only two  doubly landlocked countries  in the world [38]  \u2014 being a landlocked country wholly surrounded by other landlocked countries (the other is  Uzbekistan ). Liechtenstein is the  sixth-smallest  independent nation in the world by land area. \n The principality of Liechtenstein is  divided into 11 communes  called  Gemeinden  (singular  Gemeinde ). The  Gemeinden  mostly consist only of a single town or village. Five of them ( Eschen ,  Gamprin ,  Mauren ,  Ruggell , and  Schellenberg ) fall within the electoral district  Unterland  (the lower county), and the remainder ( Balzers ,  Planken ,  Schaan ,  Triesen ,  Triesenberg , and  Vaduz ) within  Oberland  (the upper county). \n Economy [ edit ] \nLooking southward at Vaduz city centre \n Main article:  Economy of Liechtenstein \n Despite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours. \n Liechtenstein participates in a  customs union  with Switzerland and employs the  Swiss franc  as the national currency. The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the  European Economic Area  (an organization serving as a bridge between the  European Free Trade Association  (EFTA) and the  European Union ) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Since 2002, Liechtenstein's rate of unemployment has doubled. In 2008, it stood at 1.5%. Currently, there is only one hospital in Liechtenstein, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the  CIA World Factbook  estimated the  gross domestic product  (GDP) on a  purchasing power parity  basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, which is the highest listed for the world. [38] \n Industries include electronics, textiles, precision instruments, metal manufacturing, power tools, anchor bolts, calculators, pharmaceuticals, and food products. Its most recognizable international company and largest employer is  Hilti , a manufacturer of  direct fastening systems  and other high-end  power tools . Liechtenstein produces  wheat ,  barley ,  corn ,  potatoes , dairy products, livestock, and  wine . Tourism accounts for a large portion of the country's economy. \n Taxation [ edit ] \nSince 1923, there has been no  border control  between Liechtenstein and  Switzerland . \n The government of Liechtenstein taxes personal, business income, and principal (wealth). The basic rate of  personal income tax  is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%. [39]  An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's  social security  programme. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. The basic  tax rate on wealth  is 0.06% per annum, and the combined total rate is 0.89%. The tax rate on corporate profits is 12.5%. [38] \n Liechtenstein's  gift  and  estate taxes  vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive. \n Liechtenstein has previously received significant revenues from  Stiftungen  (\"foundations\"), which are financial entities created to hide the true owner of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered in the name of a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular  tax haven  for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or  evade taxes  in their home countries. [40]  In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed a stronger determination to prosecute international money-launderers and has worked to promote the country's image as a legitimate finance center. In February 2008, the country's  LGT Bank  was implicated in a  tax-fraud scandal in Germany , which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods, referring to its $7.3 million purchase of private banking information offered by a former employee of LGT Group. [41] [42]  However, the  United States Senate 's subcommittee on tax haven banks said that the LGT bank, which is owned by the princely family, and on whose board they serve, \"is a willing partner, and an aider and abettor to clients trying to evade taxes, dodge creditors or defy court orders\". [43] \n The  2008 Liechtenstein tax affair  is a series of tax investigations in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in Liechtenstein; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for  tax evasion  in the  Federal Republic of Germany . [44]  It was also seen as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, then one of the remaining  uncooperative tax havens \u2014along with  Andorra  and  Monaco \u2014as identified by the Paris-based  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  in 2007. [45]  On 27 May 2009 the OECD removed Liechtenstein from the blacklist of uncooperative countries. [46] \n In August 2009, the British government department  HM Revenue & Customs  agreed with Liechtenstein to start exchanging information. It is believed that up to 5,000 British investors have roughly \u00a33 billion deposited in accounts and trusts in the country. [47] \n In October 2015, the European Union and Liechtenstein signed a tax agreement to ensure the automatic exchange of financial information in case of tax disputes. The collection of data started in 2016, and is another step to bring the principality in line with other European countries with regard to its taxation of private individuals and corporate assets. [48] \n Demographics [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Demographics of Liechtenstein  and  Religion in Liechtenstein \n Population-wise, Liechtenstein is the fourth smallest country of Europe; only  Vatican City ,  San Marino , and  Monaco  have fewer residents. Its population is primarily  Alemannic -speaking, although one third is foreign-born, primarily  German  speakers from  Germany ,  Austria , and  Switzerland , other Swiss,  Italians , and  Turks . Foreign-born people make up two-thirds of the country's workforce. [49] \n Liechtensteiners have an average life expectancy at birth of 80.31 years, subdividing as male: 76.86 years, female: 83.77 years (2011 est.). The infant mortality rate is 4.64 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to recent estimates. \n Languages [ edit ] \n The official language is German; most speak an  Alemannic   dialect  of German that is highly divergent from  Standard German  but closely related to those dialects spoken in neighbouring regions such as Switzerland and  Vorarlberg , Austria. In  Triesenberg , a dialect promoted by the municipality is spoken. However,  Swiss Standard German  is understood and spoken by most people within the country. \n Religion [ edit ] \n Religion in Liechtenstein in 2010 [50] \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Roman Catholic  (75.9%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Protestant  (8.5%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0Other Christian (1.4%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Muslim  (5.4%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0Other religion (0.8%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0Undeclared (2.6%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Irreligion  (5.4%) \n According to the  Constitution of Liechtenstein , the  Roman Catholic Church  is the official  state religion  of Liechtenstein: \n The Catholic Church is the State Church and as such shall enjoy the full protection of the State \n \u2014\u2009 Constitution of Liechtenstein [51] \n Liechtenstein offers protection to adherents of all religious beliefs, and considers the \"religious interests of the people\" a priority of the government. [51]  In Liechtenstein schools, although exceptions are allowed, religious education in Roman Catholicism or  Protestantism  (either  Reformed  or  Lutheran , or both) is legally required. [52]   Tax exemption  is granted by the government to religious organizations. [52]  According to the  Pew Research Center , social conflict caused by religious hostilities is ranked low in Liechtenstein, and so is the amount of government restriction on the practice of religion. [53] \n According to the 2010 census, 85.8% of total population is  Christian , of whom 75.9% adhere to the  Roman Catholic  faith, forming the exempt  Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz , while 9.6% are  Protestant , or  Orthodox  mainly organized in the  Evangelical Church in Liechtenstein  and the  Evangelical Lutheran Church in Liechtenstein , and the Christian-Orthodox Church. The largest minority religion is  Islam  (5.4% of total population). Catholicism is, by far, the predominant religion of people with Liechtenstein citizenship (87.0%).

[38]  In 2006  Programme for International Student Assessment  report, coordinated by the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th best in the world. [55]  In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA-scores of any European country. [56] \n Within Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education: \n University of Liechtenstein \n Private University in the Principality of Liechtenstein \n Liechtenstein Institute \n International Academy of Philosophy, Liechtenstein \n There are nine public high schools in the country. These include: \n Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium  in Vaduz. \n Realschule  Vaduz and  Oberschule  Vaduz, in the  Schulzentrum M\u00fchleholz II  in Vaduz [57] \n Realschule Schaan and Sportschule Liechtenstein in  Schaan [57] \n Transport [ edit ] \n There are about 250 kilometres (155 miles) of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with 90\u00a0km (56 miles) of marked bicycle paths. \n Balzers Heliport \n A 9.5\u00a0km (5.9\u00a0mi) railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The  country's railways  are administered by the  Austrian Federal Railways  as part of the route between  Feldkirch ,  Austria , and  Buchs ,  Switzerland . Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg [58]  tariff region. \n There are four stations in Liechtenstein, namely  Schaan-Vaduz ,  Forst Hilti ,  Nendeln  and  Schaanwald , served by an irregularly stopping train service that runs between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by the Austrian Federal Rail Service. While  EuroCity  and other long distance international trains also travel along the route, they do not normally stop at the stations within the borders of Liechtenstein. \n Liechtenstein Bus  is a subsidiary of the  Swiss Postbus system , but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at  Buchs  and at  Sargans . Buses also run to the Austrian town of Feldkirch. \n Liechtenstein has no airport. The nearest large airport is  Z\u00fcrich Airport  near  Z\u00fcrich ,  Switzerland  (130\u00a0km/80\u00a0mi by road). The nearest small airport is  St. Gallen Airport  (50\u00a0km/30\u00a0mi).  Friedrichshafen Airport  also provides access to Liechtenstein, as it is 85\u00a0km away.  Balzers Heliport  is [59] [60]  available for chartered helicopter flights. \n Culture [ edit ] \n See also:  Music of Liechtenstein \n Part of  a series  on the \n Culture of Liechtenstein \n History \n People \n Languages \n Mythology and folklore \n Mythology \n Cuisine \n Festivals \n Religion \n Music and performing arts \n Music \n Media \n Television \n Sport \n Symbols \n Flag \n Coat of arms \n   Liechtenstein  portal \n v \n t \n e \nCity-centre with Kunstmuseum ( Liechtenstein Art Museum ) \n Liechtenstein National Museum \n As a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern German-speaking areas of Europe, including Austria, Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Switzerland, and specifically  Tirol  and  Vorarlberg . The \"Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein\" plays a role in preserving the culture and history of the country. \n The largest museum is the  Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein , an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a \"black box\" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein. \n The other important museum is the  Liechtenstein National Museum  ( Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum ) showing permanent exhibition on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum. \n The  Liechtenstein State Library  is the library that has  legal deposit  for all books published in the country. \n The most famous historical sites are  Vaduz Castle ,  Gutenberg Castle , the Red House and the ruins of Schellenberg. \n The Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the  Liechtenstein Museum  in  Vienna . \n On the country's national holiday all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served. [61] \n Media [ edit ] \n The primary  internet service provider  and  mobile network operator  of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan. There is only one television channel in the country, the private channel  1FLTV  created in 2008. At the moment, 1FLTV is not a member of the  European Broadcasting Union . L-Radio, which was established in 2004, serves as Liechtenstein's radio station and is based in Triesen. L-Radio has a listener base of 50,000 and began as \"air Radio Liechtenstein\" on 15 October 1938. Liechtenstein also has two major  newspapers ;  Liechtensteiner Volksblatt  and  Liechtensteiner Vaterland . The primary  multimedia  company in Liechtenstein is  ManaMedia , located in Vaduz. \n Amateur radio  is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own  ITU prefix . It uses Switzerland's callsign prefixes (typically \"HB\") followed by a zero. \n Music and theatre are an important part of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres. \n Sports [ edit ] \n See also:  Rugby union in Liechtenstein \n Marco B\u00fcchel , the first Liechtensteiner alpine skier to compete at six  Winter Olympics . \n Liechtenstein  football  teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The  Liechtenstein Football Cup  allows access for one Liechtenstein team each year to the  UEFA Europa League ;  FC Vaduz , a team playing in the  Swiss Challenge League , the second division in Swiss football, is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the  European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996  when they drew with and defeated the  Latvian  team  FC Universitate Riga  by 1\u20131 and 4\u20132, to go on to a lucrative fixture against  Paris Saint-Germain F.C. , which they lost 0\u20133 and 0\u20134. \n The  Liechtenstein national football team  is regarded as an easy target for any team drawn against them; this was the basis for a book about Liechtenstein's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the  2002 World Cup  by British author,  Charlie Connelly . In one surprising week during autumn 2004, however, the team managed a 2\u20132 draw with  Portugal , who only a few months earlier had been the losing finalists in the  European Championships . Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated  the home team  4\u20130 in a  2006 World Cup  qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1\u20130, a result which prompted the resignation of the Latvian coach. They went on to beat Iceland 3\u20130 on 17 October 2007, which is considered one of the most dramatic losses of the Icelandic national football team. On 7 September 2010, they came within seconds of a 1\u20131 draw against  Scotland  in Glasgow, having led 1\u20130 earlier in the second half, but Liechtenstein lost 2\u20131 thanks to a goal by  Stephen McManus  in the 97th minute. On 3 June 2011, Liechtenstein defeated  Lithuania  2\u20130. On 15 November 2014, Liechtenstein defeated  Moldova  0-1 with  Franz Burgmeier 's late free kick goal in  Chi\u0219in\u0103u . \n As an  alpine  country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as  downhill skiing : the country's single ski area is  Malbun .  Hanni Wenzel  won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980  Winter Olympics  (she won bronze in 1976), and her brother  Andreas  won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the  giant slalom  event. With nine medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation. [62]  It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are  Marco B\u00fcchel ,  Tina Weirather ,  Willi Frommelt ,  Paul Frommelt  and  Ursula Konzett . Liechtenstein is also the home country of  Stephanie Vogt , a professional women's  tennis  player. \n Youth [ edit ] \n Liechtenstein  competes in the Switzerland U16 Cup Tournament, which offers young players an opportunity to play against top football clubs. \n Security and defence [ edit ] \n The  Liechtenstein National Police  is responsible for keeping order within the country. It consists of 87 field officers and 38 civilian staff, totaling 125 employees. All officers are equipped with  small arms . The country has one of the world's lowest  crime rates . Liechtenstein's prison holds few, if any, inmates, and those with sentences over two years are transferred to Austrian jurisdiction. The Liechtenstein National Police maintains a trilateral treaty with Austria and Switzerland that enables close cross-border cooperation among the police forces of the three countries. [63] \n Liechtenstein follows a policy of  neutrality  and is one of the few  countries in the world that maintain no military . The army was abolished soon after the  Austro-Prussian War of 1866 , in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. The demise of the  German Confederation  in that war freed Liechtenstein from its international obligation to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for one. The Prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenceless, but relented on 12 February 1868 and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colors of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at age 95. [64] \n During the 1980s the Swiss army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved \"over a case of white wine\". [61] \n In March 2007, a 170-person Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed 1.5\u00a0km (0.9 miles) into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back. [65]  The Swiss army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies.
