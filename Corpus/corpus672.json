Her successful lawsuit was the subject of a 2000 film,  Erin Brockovich , which starred  Julia Roberts . Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality as well, hosting the TV series  Challenge America with Erin Brockovich  on  ABC  and  Final Justice  on  Zone Reality . She is the president of Brockovich Research & Consulting. She also works as a consultant for Girardi & Keese, [1] [2]  the New York law firm of Weitz & Luxenberg, [3]  which has a focus on personal injury claims for  asbestos  exposure, and  Shine Lawyers  in Australia.

She has two brothers, Frank Jr. and Thomas (1954\u20131992), and a sister, Jodie. [5]  She graduated from  Lawrence High School , then attended  Kansas State University , in  Manhattan, Kansas , and graduated with an Associate in Applied Arts Degree from  Wade College  in Dallas, Texas. She worked as a management trainee for  Kmart  in 1981 but quit after a few months and entered a beauty pageant. She won Miss  Pacific Coast  in 1981 and left the beauty pageant after the win. She has lived in California since 1982. \n Pacific Gas and Electric litigation [ edit ] \n Main article:  Hinkley groundwater contamination \n The case alleged contamination of drinking water with  hexavalent chromium  (also written as \"chromium VI\", \"Cr-VI\" or \"Cr-6\") in the southern California town of  Hinkley . At the center of the case was a facility, the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a  natural-gas  pipeline connecting to the  San Francisco Bay Area . Between 1952 and 1966, PG&E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight  corrosion . The wastewater was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some percolated into the  groundwater , affecting an area near the plant approximately 2 by 1 mile (3.2 by 1.6\u00a0km). [6]  The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) put the PG&E site under its regulations in 1968. \n The case was  settled  in 1996 for  US$ 333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history.  Masry & Vititoe , the law firm for which Brockovich was a legal clerk, received $133.6 million of that settlement, and Brockovich herself was given a bonus of $2.5 million. [7] \n A study released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry showed that cancer rates in Hinkley \"remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008\". [8]  An  epidemiologist  involved in the study said that the 196 cases of  cancer  reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were fewer than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer. [8]  However, a June 2013  Mother Jones  magazine article featured an extensive critique from the  Center for Public Integrity  of the author's work on the later epidemiological studies. [9] \n As of 2006, average Cr-6 levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 ppb with a peak of 3.09  ppb . For comparison, the PG&E  Topock  Compressor Station on the California-Arizona border averaged 7.8 ppb with peaks of 31.8 ppb based on a PG&E Background Study. [10] \n Other litigation [ edit ] \n Working with  Edward L. Masry , a lawyer based in  Thousand Oaks, California , Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One suit accused the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in  Willits, California . Another, which listed 1,200  plaintiffs , alleged contamination near PG&E's Kettleman Hills compressor station in  Kings County, California , along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006. [11] \n In 2003, Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 from two parties and an undisclosed amount from a third party to settle her lawsuit alleging  toxic mold  in her  Agoura Hills , California, home. [12]  After experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the  Conejo Valley , Brockovich became a prominent activist and educator in this area as well. \n Brockovich and Masry filed suit against the  Beverly Hills Unified School District  in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a  cluster of oil wells  on campus. [13]  Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate a substantial link, and  Los Angeles County  Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs. [14]  In May 2007, the School District announced that it was to be paid $450,000 as reimbursement for legal expenses. [15] \n Brockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of  St. Joseph ,  Missouri , in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors (70 since 1996) around the town of  Cameron ,  Missouri , which is currently being investigated by the EPA. [16] \n In June 2009, Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in  Midland ,  Texas . [17]  \"Significant amounts\" of hexavalent chromium were found in the water of more than 40 homes in the area, some of which have now been fitted with state-monitored filters on their water supply. [17]  Brockovich said \"The only difference between here and Hinkley is that I saw higher levels here than I saw in Hinkley.\" [17] \nBrockovich in 2012 \n In 2012, Brockovich got involved in the mysterious case of 14 students from  LeRoy, New York , who began reporting perplexing medical symptoms including tics and speech difficulty. [18]  Brockovich believed  environmental pollution  from the  1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment  was the cause and conducted testing in the area. Brockovich was supposed to return to town to present her findings, but never did; in the meantime the students' doctors determined the cause was  mass psychogenic illness  and that the media exposure was making it worse. [19]  No environmental causes were found after repeat testing and the students improved once the media attention died down. [20]  In early 2016, Brockovich became involved in potential litigation against  Southern California Gas  for a large methane leak from its underground storage facility near the community of  Porter Ranch  north of Los Angeles (see  Aliso Canyon gas leak ). \n Awards [ edit ] \n Honorary   Doctor of laws  and commencement speaker at  Lewis & Clark Law School ,  Portland, Oregon , in May 2005. [21] \n Honorary  Doctor of Humane Letters  and commencement speaker at  Loyola Marymount University ,  Los Angeles , on May 5, 2007. [21] \n Honorary  Master of Arts , Business Communication, from  Jones International University ,  Centennial ,  Colorado . [21] \n Movies [ edit ] \n Brockovich's work in bringing litigation against Pacific Gas and Electric was the focus of the 2000 feature film,  Erin Brockovich , starring  Julia Roberts  in the title role. The film was nominated for five  Academy Awards : Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Writing in a Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Roberts won the  Academy Award for Best Actress  for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich. Erin Brockovich herself had a  cameo  role as a waitress named Julia R. \n Erin Brockovich is named in the  Roni Size  song, Ghetto Celebrity, from the 2000 album  In the M\u00f8de . She was also featured in  The Lonely Island  song featuring  Michael Bolton , Jack Sparrow. \n Brockovich had a more extensive role in the 2012 documentary  Last Call at the Oasis , which focused on not only water pollution but also the overall state of  water scarcity  as it relates to  water policy  in the United States. [22] \n Book [ edit ] \n Brockovich's book, titled  Take It From Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win , ( ISBN \u00a0 978-0071383790 ) was published in 2001. \n References [ edit ] \n ^   \"Girardi & Keese Law Firm\"   (PDF) .
