Follow these steps to apply for an independent course(s): \n 1. Contact the\u00a0 Graduate Program Assistant  to determine if that program accepts independent students. \n 2. Review course descriptions in the  Graduate Calendar  and choose the course(s) that interest you. \n 3. Complete the graduate  Authorization to Register as a Non-Degree Student  form. \n 4. Submit the completed form to the  Graduate Program Assistant  of the graduate program that offers the course. You must also submit a copy of your most recent transcript (student copies are acceptable) and appropriate\u00a0proof of residency. \n 5. Read the complete information on \u00a0 Independent Graduate Students  \u00a0in the Graduate Calendar. \n Upon receipt of all the required documents, the Graduate Program Director will evaluate the applicant\u2019s academic credentials to determine if the applicant is qualified to take the graduate course(s). \n Independent graduate students register for courses  after  degree students enrol and are not guaranteed a place in a course. \n Limit on course registration \n Independent graduate students take no more than the equivalent of two graduate courses per term and up to a maximum of 12 credits from a specific program. Independent students are classified as graduate part-time students. \n After you are accepted \n Permanent Code \n As per the Ministry of Education, all students are required to have a permanent code in order to study in Qu\u00e9bec. Students who do not have a permanent code will be charged an additional fee for their courses. To avoid the additional charge, applicants must make the necessary arrangements to  obtain a permanent code . \n Learn more about the  Quebec Permanent Code . \n Helpful resources \n Independent students guide \n Ask a question \n Recruitment events \n Campus tours \n Follow us \n /CUFutureStudents \n @CUFutureStudent \n @CUfuturestudent \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
