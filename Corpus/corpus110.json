We expect that use of these logos on conformant sites\n\t\twill help raise awareness of accessibility issues. \n Conformance to WCAG 1.0 is defined in  section 5  of the\n\t\tspecification. Here is the excerpt that defines the conformance levels: \n Conformance Level \"A\": all Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied; \n Conformance Level \"Double-A\": all Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints are\n\t\t\t\tsatisfied; \n Conformance Level \"Triple-A\": all Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints\n\t\t\t\tare satisfied; \n Please refer to WCAG 1.0 for more information about information required\n\t\tin a conformance claim. \n How to use the logos \n First, decide which of the following levels of conformance you wish to\n\t\tclaim for your page: \n level A \n Double-A \n Triple-A \n\t\t\t\t\t( gif ,  svg ,  eps ) \n\t\t\t\t\t( gif ,  svg ,  eps ) \n\t\t\t\t\t( gif ,  svg ,  eps ) \n\t\t\t\t\t( gif ,  svg ,  eps ) \n\t\t\t\t\t( gif ,  svg ,  eps ) \n\t\t\t\t\t( gif ,  svg ,  eps ) \n Level A Conformance \n Put the following HTML markup in your page: \n <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1A-Conformance\"\n      title=\"Explanation of Level A Conformance\">\n  <img height=\"32\" width=\"88\"\n          src=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag1A\"\n          alt=\"Level A conformance icon,\n          W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\"></a> \n If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src.  \n Level Double-A Conformance \n Put the following HTML markup in your page: \n <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1AA-Conformance\"\n      title=\"Explanation of Level Double-A Conformance\">\n  <img height=\"32\" width=\"88\"\n          src=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag1AA\"\n          alt=\"Level Double-A conformance icon,\n          W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\"></a> \n If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src.  \n Level Triple-A Conformance \n Put the following HTML markup in your page: \n <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1AAA-Conformance\"\n      title=\"Explanation of Level Triple-A Conformance\">\n  <img height=\"32\" width=\"88\"\n          src=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag1AAA\"\n          alt=\"Level Triple-A conformance icon,\n          W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\"></a> \n If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src.  \n Scope of the claim \n By default, a conformance icon refers to a single page.  If the claim is\n\t\tmeant to apply to include more than one page, the conformance icon must be\n\t\taccompanied by explicit scope information explaining which pages are covered\n\t\tby the claim. \n Responsibility for accuracy of claims \n Content providers are solely responsible for the use of these logos.\n\t\tBefore using these logos as part of a conformance claim, we recommend that\n\t\tthe provider be familiar with the  Web Content\n\t\tAccessibility Guidelines 1.0  and use a variety of review methods to\n\t\tensure that any page using this logo meets the conformance level claimed.\n\t\tProviders should also ensure that anyone maintaining or updating the site is\n\t\tfamiliar with logo use, and either re-reviews the page or removes the logo\n\t\tfrom the page if they are unsure whether it still meets a specified\n\t\tconformance level. \n Please note that use of this logo is not conditional on an automated test.\n\t\tThere is as yet no tool that can perform a completely automatic assessment on\n\t\tthe checkpoints in the guidelines, and fully automatic testing may remain\n\t\tdifficult or impossible. For instance, some checkpoints rely on an\n\t\tinterpretation of what \"important\" information is, or whether the text\n\t\tequivalent for a non-text element is accurate. \n It is also possible for automated accessibility checkers to register\n\t\t\"false negatives\" or \"false positives\" due to the type of mark-up on a page.\n\t\tFor these reasons, the logos on this page are used to indicate only a claim\n\t\tof conformance made by the author of a page, not a machine-validated\n\t\tconformance. \n Document Information \n Version 1.0 \n [ Contacting WAI ] \n [ WAI Site Map ] [ Help with WAI Website ] [ Search ] [ Contacting WAI ] \n Feedback welcome to  wai-eo-editors@w3.org  (a publicly archived list) or  wai@w3.org  (a WAI staff-only list).
