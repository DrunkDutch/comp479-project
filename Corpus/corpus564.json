It is used for  maintenance of the Wikipedia project  and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not  articles , or it groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. \nThis is a  hidden category . It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding  user preference 'Show hidden categories'  is set. \nThis is a  tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. Pages are added to tracking categories through templates. \n This category has a  backlog  that requires the attention of willing editors. \n This notice will hide itself when this category has fewer than 50 items.   ( recount ) \n Pages are placed in this category when any of the following cite errors are generated on the page: \n The named reference  $1  was invoked but never defined (see the  help page ). \n Where $1 is the  <ref>  tag name. \n Please do not delete the ref nor comment it out. This error usually occurs because someone deleted another ref with that same name that had text in it. To fix these errors, look in the page history to find the deleted ref and copy its text into the remaining ref with the error message. To find first entry of ref use  WikiBlame .  AnomieBOT  does some fixes and often leaves helpful suggestions on an article's Talk page. \n Contents \n Top \n 0\u20139 \n A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z \n Update \nthis page \n If you fix it you can leave this edit summary if you wish: \n Fix broken reference name \u2013 You can help [[:Category:Pages with broken reference names]] \n The pages  Template:Broken ref ,  Help:Cite errors , and subpages contain deliberate errors and do not need to be repaired. \n See also:  Category:Articles with incorrect citation syntax . \n UPDATE this page \n Pages in category \"Pages with broken reference names\" \n The following 200 pages are in this category, out of approximately 3,009 total.
