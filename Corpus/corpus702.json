Some, like Severus Snape, are complex and mysterious. Their stories span the decades, the whole saga and beyond. Others, like Mundungus Fletcher, manage to be interesting and complicated even though they only pop in and out of the story occasionally. There are witches and wizards, hags and giants, house-elves and Muggles, werewolves and vampires, good people and bad. Many of them have particularly appropriate names, like Remus Lupin the werewolf: Remus was one of the wolf-raised twins who legend tells us founded the city of Rome and Lupin comes from the Latin word for wolf. Alliterative names abound \u2014 Dudley Dursley, Peter Pettigrew. Family members and friends of the author turn up attached to bus drivers and Quidditch players. And even the names that have no deeper meaning roll off the tongue like delightful sweets: the name of Hambledon Quince comes to mind. \n Here you can read their stories, explore their family trees, and find out every detail about them all, whatever their species or magical ability. If they have a name, you\u2019ll find them here. \n Notable Characters \n Harry \n Dumbledore \n Voldemort \n Snape \n Sirius \n Hermione \n Ron \n Draco \n Hagrid \n Neville \n Dobby \n Moody \n Lupin \n Bellatrix \n McGonagall \n Newt Scamander \n Grindelwald \n Tina \n Queenie \n Jacob \n Index of Characters \n # \n A \n B \n C \n D \n E \n F \n G \n H \n I \n J \n K \n L \n M \n N \n O \n P \n Q \n R \n S \n T \n U \n V \n W \n X \n Y \n Z \n Families \n The Black Family  |  Black Family Tree \n The Bones family \n The Crouch family \n The Diggory family \n The Gaunt family \n The Longbottom family \n The Malfoy family \n The Potter family \n The Weasley family \n The Dursley family \n Essays \n Essay:  Generations in the Wizarding World  by Ebony (aka AngieJ) \n Essay:  The Changing Image of Grown-Ups  by Elizabeth Dalton \n Essay:  Secrets of the Class List  by Diana Summers \n Groups and Related Resources \n Lists of Magical People \n Animagi \n Authors in the Wizarding World \n Blood status \n Book quotes by and about notable characters \n Death Eaters and their victims \n Dumbledore\u2019s Army (\u201cD.A.\u201d) \n Famous Wizard trading cards \n Ghosts \n Hogwarts Founders \n Hogwarts staff members \n Hogwarts students \n Inquisitorial Squad \n Ministry of Magic personnel \n Musicians & entertainers \n Order of the Phoenix \n Quidditch teams \n Slug Club \n 1  Notable Characters 2  Index of Characters 3  Families 4  Essays 5  Groups and Related Resources \n Table of Contents \n 1  Notable Characters 2  Index of Characters 3  Families 4  Essays 5  Groups and Related Resources \n Editor:   Steve VanderArk \n \u00a9 2000 \u2013 2017 The  Harry Potter  Lexicon \n The Harry Potter Lexicon is an unofficial Harry Potter fansite.
