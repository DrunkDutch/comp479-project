Apart from its coastline with the  South China Sea , the country is completely surrounded by the  Malaysian   state  of  Sarawak . It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of  Limbang . Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and  Indonesia .  Brunei's population  was 423,196 in 2016. [11] \n At the peak of the  Bruneian Empire ,  Sultan Bolkiah  (reigned 1485\u20131528) is alleged to have had control over most regions of  Borneo , including modern-day Sarawak and  Sabah , as well as the  Sulu Archipelago  off the northeast tip of Borneo,  Seludong  (modern-day  Manila ), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The  maritime state  was visited by Spain's  Magellan Expedition  in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578  Castilian War . \n During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak ( Kuching ) to  James Brooke  and installed him as the  White Rajah , and it ceded Sabah to the British  North Borneo Chartered Company . In 1888, Brunei became a British  protectorate  and was assigned a  British resident  as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during  World War II , in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small  armed rebellion  against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British. [12] \n Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest  Human Development Index  among the  Southeast Asian  nations, after Singapore, and is classified as a \" developed country \". [13]  According to the  International Monetary Fund  (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at  purchasing power parity . The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being  Libya ) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP.  Forbes  also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.

He moved from Garang in the  Temburong  District [15]  to the  Brunei River  estuary, discovering Brunei. According to legend, upon landing he exclaimed,  Baru nah  (loosely translated as \"that's it!\" or \"there\"), from which the name \"Brunei\" was derived. [16]  He was the first Muslim ruler of Brunei. [17]  Before the rise of the  Bruneian Empire  under the Muslim Bolkiah Dynasty, Brunei is believed to have been under Buddhist rulers. [18] \n It was renamed \"Barunai\" in the 14th century, possibly influenced by the  Sanskrit  word \" varu\u1e47 \" ( \u0935\u0930\u0941\u0923 ), meaning \"seafarers\". [19]  The word \" Borneo \" is of the same origin. In the country's full name,  Negara Brunei Darussalam ,  darussalam  ( Arabic :  \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u200e) means \"abode of peace\", while  negara  means \"country\" in  Malay . \n The earliest recorded documentation by the West about Brunei is by an Italian known as  Ludovico di Varthema , who also said the \"Bruneian people have fairer skin tone than the peoples he met in  Maluku Islands \". On his documentation back to 1550; \n We arrived at the island of Bornei  (Brunei or Borneo),  which is distant from the  Maluch  about two hundred miles, and we found that it was somewhat larger than the aforesaid and much lower. The people are pagans and are men of goodwill. Their colour is whiter than that of the other sort....in this island justice is well administered... [20] \n History \n Main article:  History of Brunei \n Early history \nThe  tomb of a ruler of Po-ni  in  Nanjing ,  Jiangsu ,  China . \n One of the earliest Chinese records is the 977 AD letter to Chinese emperor from the ruler of Po-ni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo. [21]  In 1225, a Chinese official, Chau Ju-Kua ( Zhao Rugua ), reported that Po-ni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was a lot of wealth in the kingdom. [22] \n In the fourteenth century, the  Javanese  manuscript  Nagarakretagama , written by  Prapanca  in 1365, mentioned  Barune  as the  vassal state  of  Majapahit , [23]  which had to make an annual  tribute  of 40  katis  of  camphor . In 1369, the Sulus attacked Po-ni, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Po-ni was left weaker after the attack. [24]  A Chinese report from 1371 described Po-ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit. [25] \n However, scholars claim that the power of the  Sultanate  of Brunei was at  its peak  between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines. [26]  By the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltr\u00e1n, a Spanish traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water. [27] \n War with Spain and decline \nBrunei territorial losses from 1400 to 1890. \n European influence  gradually brought an end to the  regional power , as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. Since the Spanish regarded Brunei the center of Islamic preaching in the Philippines [26]  Spain  declared war  in 1578, planning to attack and capture  Kota Batu , Brunei's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two Bruneian  noblemen , Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to  Manila , then the centre of the Spanish colony, Manila itself was captured from Brunei and Christianized, Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer Brunei as a  tributary  to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. [28]  The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new  Bendahara . \n In March 1578, the Spanish fleet had arrived from Mexico and settled at the Philippines, they were led by  De Sande , acting as  Capit\u00e1n-General , he organized an expedition from Manila for Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spanish, 1,500  Filipino  natives and 300 Borneans. [29]  The campaign was one of many, which also included action in  Mindanao  and  Sulu . [30] [31] \n The Spanish invaded the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to  Jerudong . In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a  cholera  or  dysentery  outbreak, [32] [33]  the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof. [34] \n Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies. There was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan. Seri Lela's daughter, a Bruneian princess had left with the Spanish, she married a Christian  Tagalog , named Agust\u00edn de Legazpi de Tondo. [35] \n The local Brunei accounts [36]  differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a  folk-hero  account, which probably developed decades or centuries after. [37]  The country suffered a  civil war  from 1660 to 1673. \nBritish adventurer  James Brooke  negotiating with the  Sultan of Brunei , which led to the signing of the  Treaty of Labuan , 1846 \n British intervention \n See also:  British Brunei Administrators \nBoundaries of Brunei (green) since 1890. \n The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on several occasions. Britain attacked Brunei in July 1846 due to internal conflicts over who was the rightful Sultan. [38] \n In the 1880s, the decline of the  Bruneian Empire  continued. The sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to  James Brooke , who had helped him quell a rebellion and allowed him to establish the  Kingdom of Sarawak . Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land. Brunei lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the  White Rajahs . \n Sultan  Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin  appealed to the British to stop further encroachment by the Brookes. [39]  The \"Treaty of Protection\" was negotiated by  Sir Hugh Low  and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty said that the sultan \"could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent\"; it provided  Britain  effective control over Brunei's external affairs, making it a British  protectorate  (which continued until 1984). [26]  But, when the Kingdom of Sarawak annexed Brunei's  Pandaruan District  in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either Brunei or the Kingdom of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small land mass and separation into two parts. [40] \n British residents  were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906. [41]  The residents were to advise the sultan on all matters of administration. Over time, the resident assumed more executive control than the sultan. The residential system ended in 1959. [42] \n Discovery of oil \n Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts. [43]  Two men, F.F. Marriot and T.G. Cochrane, smelled oil near the  Seria  river in late 1926. [44]  They informed a  geophysicist , who conducted a survey there. In 1927, gas seepages were reported in the area. Seria Well Number One (S-1) was drilled on 12 July 1928. Oil was struck at 297 metres (974\u00a0ft) on 5 April 1929. Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929, and, as of 2009 [update] , continues to produce oil. [45]  Oil production was increased considerably in the 1930s with the development of more oil fields. In 1940, oil production was at more than six million barrels. [45]  The British Malayan Petroleum Company (now  Brunei Shell Petroleum  Company) was formed on 22 July 1922. [46]  The first offshore well was drilled in 1957. [47]  Oil and natural gas have been the basis of Brunei's development and wealth since the late 20th century. \n Japanese occupation \n Main article:  Japanese occupation of British Borneo \n Ahmad Tajuddin , the  27th Sultan of Brunei , with members of his court in April 1941, eight months before the Japanese invaded Brunei. \n The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after their  attack on Pearl Harbor  and the United States Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the  Kawaguchi Detachment  from  Cam Ranh Bay  at  Kuala Belait . After six days fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the  15th Punjab Regiment  based at  Kuching , Sarawak. [48] \n Once the Japanese occupied Brunei, they made an agreement with  Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin  over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed  Chief Administrative Officer  under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were interned by the Japanese at  Batu Lintang camp  in Sarawak. While the British officials were under Japanese guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well. [49] \n The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya,  Limbang  and had little to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British  North Borneo . The Prefectures included  Baram ,  Labuan ,  Lawas , and  Limbang . Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran  Haji Mohd Yusuf ), along with other Bruneians, was sent to Japan for training. Although in the area the day of the  atomic bombing of Hiroshima , Yusuf survived. \nJapanese battleships at Brunei in October 1944. \n The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the  Seria  oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the  Japanese invaded Malaya . By the end of the war, 16 wells at  Miri  and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at  Muara  was also recommenced, but with little success. \n Major-General Wootten  of the Australian 9th Division with  Lieutenant-General Masao Baba  (signing) of the Japanese 37th Division at the surrender ceremony at Labuan on 10 September 1945. \n During the occupation, the Japanese had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as  duit pisang  (banana money) . From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered famine and disease. \n The  airport  runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation, and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in  Brunei Bay  and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese, which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed  Kampong Ayer . [50] \n On 10 June 1945, the  Australian 9th Division  landed at Muara under  Operation Oboe Six  to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed, including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946. \n Post-World War II \n After  World War II , a new government was formed in Brunei under the  British Military Administration  (BMA). It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen. [51]  The administration of Brunei was passed to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945. The Brunei State Council was also revived that year. [52]  The BMA was tasked to revive the Bruneian economy, which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation. They also had to put out the fires on the wells of Seria, which had been set by the Japanese prior to their defeat. [52] \n Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei,  Sarawak , and  North Borneo  (now  Sabah ). [53]  The first  British High Commissioner  for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke. The Barisan Pemuda (\"Youth Movement\") (abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei, on 12 April 1946. The party intended to \"preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the  Malays \". [54]  BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity. \n In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom. [55]  A small  rebellion  erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the  Brunei Revolt , it contributed to the failure to create the  North Borneo Federation . The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation. [55] \n Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. [55]  The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, is held by tradition on 23 February. [56] \n Writing of the Constitution \n In July 1953, Sultan  Omar Ali Saifuddien III  formed a seven-member committee named  Tujuh Serangkai , to find out the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution. [57]  The British delegation was led by Sir  Alan Lennox-Boyd , Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution. \n On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in  Bandar Seri Begawan . The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. It included the following provisions: [41] \n The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State. \n Brunei was responsible for its internal administration. \n The British Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only. \n The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner. \n Five councils were set up: [58] \n The Executive Council \n The Legislative Council of Brunei \n The Privy Council \n The Council of Succession \n The State Religious Council \n National development plans \n A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei,  Omar Ali Saifuddien III . \n The first was introduced in 1953. [59]  A total sum of B$100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in  Fiji , was appointed to implement it. [60]  A $US14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700  bpd . \n The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4 million. [60]  Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at Berakas Airport was completed in 1954. [61] \n The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962. [61]  A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery,  Liquefied Natural Gas  became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then. [62]  The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The  deepwater port  at  Muara  was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas. [62]  Efforts were made to eradicate  malaria , an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the  World Health Organisation . Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. [63]  The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. [63]  Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population. [63] \n Independence \n On 14 November 1971, Sultan  Hassanal Bolkiah  left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being  Anthony Royle . [64] \n Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon: \n Brunei was granted full internal self-government \n The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence. \n Brunei and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence. \n This agreement also caused  Gurkha units  to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day. \n On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the UK. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatic matters. [65]  In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984. [ citation needed ] \n On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title \" His Majesty \", rather than the previous \" His Royal Highness \". [66]  Brunei was  admitted to the United Nations  on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member. [67] \n 21st century \n In October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose Sharia law on the country's Muslims, which take up roughly two thirds of the country's population. [68]  This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making Brunei the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia law into its penal code. [69]  The move attracted international criticism, [70]  the United Nations expressing \"deep concern\". [71] \n Geography \n Main article:  Geography of Brunei \n Brunei is a southeast Asian country consisting of two unconnected parts with a total area of 5,765 square kilometres (2,226\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) on the island of Borneo. It has 161 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) of coastline next to the  South China sea , and it shares a 381\u00a0km (237\u00a0mi) border with Malaysia. It has 500 square kilometres (193\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of territorial waters, and a 200-nautical-mile (370\u00a0km; 230\u00a0mi)  exclusive economic zone . [26] \n About 97% of the population lives in the larger western part ( Belait ,  Tutong , and  Brunei-Muara ), while only about 10,000 people live in the mountainous eastern part ( Temburong District ). The total population of Brunei is approximately 408,000 as of July 2010 [update] , of which around 150,000 live in the capital  Bandar Seri Begawan . [72]  Other major towns are the port town of  Muara , the oil-producing town of  Seria  and its neighbouring town,  Kuala Belait . In Belait District, the  Panaga  area is home to large numbers of Europeans expatriates, due to  Royal Dutch Shell  and British Army housing, and several recreational facilities are located there. [73] \n Most of Brunei is within the  Borneo lowland rain forests  ecoregion, which covers most of the island. Areas of  mountain rain forests  inland. [74] \nThe panorama of Bandar Seri Begawan, showing Kampong Ayer in the Brunei River during the 2013 Brunei Regatta. \n Climate \n The  climate of Brunei  is  tropical   equatorial . [26] \n Politics and government \n Main article:  Politics of Brunei \n Hassanal Bolkiah ,  Sultan of Brunei . \n Brunei's political system is governed by the constitution and the national tradition of the Malay Islamic Monarchy, the concept of  Melayu Islam Beraja  (MIB). The three components of MIB cover Malay culture, Islamic religion, and the political framework under the monarchy. [75]  It has a legal system based on  English common law , although Islamic  shariah law  supersedes this in some cases. [26]  Brunei  has a parliament  but there are no elections; the last election was held in  1962 . [76] \n Under Brunei's 1959 constitution,  His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah  is the  head of state  with full executive authority. Since  1962 , this authority has included emergency powers, which are renewed every two years. Brunei has technically been under  martial law  since the  Brunei Revolt  of 1962. [55]   Hassanal Bolkiah  also serves as the state's Prime Minister,  Finance Minister  and  Defence Minister . [77]  The Royal family retains a venerated status within Brunei.

After that, they were handled by the Brunei Diplomatic Service. After independence in 1984, this Service was upgraded to ministerial level and is now known as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [78] \n Officially, Brunei's foreign policy is as follows: [79] \n Mutual respect of others' territorial sovereignty, integrity and independence; \n The maintenance of friendly relations among nations; \n Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries; and \n The maintenance and the promotion of peace, security and stability in the region. \n With its traditional ties with the United Kingdom, Brunei became the 49th member of the  Commonwealth  immediately on the day of its independence on 1 January 1984. [80]  As one of its first initiatives toward improved regional relations, Brunei joined  ASEAN  on 7 January 1984, becoming the sixth member. To achieve recognition of its sovereignty and independence, it joined the  United Nations  as a full member on 21 September of that same year. [81] \n As an Islamic country, Brunei became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the  Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ) in January 1984 at the Fourth Islamic Summit held in  Morocco . [82] \n After its accession to the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum (APEC) in 1989, Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2000 and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2002. [83]  Brunei became a founding member of the  World Trade Organization  (WTO) on 1 January 1995, [84]  and is a major player in  BIMP-EAGA , which was formed during the Inaugural Ministers' Meeting in  Davao ,  Philippines  on 24 March 1994. [85] \n Brunei shares a close relationship with  Singapore  and the Philippines. In April 2009, Brunei and the Philippines signed a  Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU) that seeks to strengthen the bilateral co-operation of the two countries in the fields of agriculture and farm-related trade and investments. [86] \n Brunei is one of many nations to lay claim to some of the disputed  Spratly Islands . [87]  The status of  Limbang  as part of Sarawak has been disputed by Brunei since the area was first annexed in 1890. [87]  The issue was reportedly settled in 2009, with Brunei agreeing to accept the border in exchange for Malaysia giving up claims to oil fields in Bruneian waters. [88]  The Brunei government denies this and says that their claim on Limbang was never dropped. [89] [90] \n Brunei was the chair for  ASEAN  in 2013. [91]  It also hosted the ASEAN summit on that same year. [92] \n Defence \n Main article:  Royal Brunei Armed Forces \n Brunei maintains three infantry battalions stationed around the country. [55]  The Brunei navy has several \"Ijtihad\"-class patrol boats purchased from a German manufacturer. The United Kingdom also maintains a base in  Seria , the centre of the oil industry in Brunei. A Gurkha battalion consisting of 1,500 personnel is stationed there. [55]  United Kingdom military personnel are stationed there under a defence agreement signed between the two countries. [55] \n A  Bell 212  operated by the air force crashed in  Kuala Belait  on 20 July 2012 with the loss of 12 of the 14 crew on board. The cause of the accident has yet to be ascertained. [93]  The crash is the worst aviation incident in the history of Brunei. \n The Army is currently acquiring new equipment, [94]  including  UAVs  and  S-70i Black Hawks . [95] \n Brunei's Legislative Council proposed an increase of the defence budget for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year of about five per cent to 564 million Brunei dollars ($408 million). This amounts to about ten per cent of the state's total national yearly expenditure and represents around 2.5 per cent of GDP. [96] \n Administrative divisions \n Main articles:  Districts of Brunei  and  Mukims of Brunei \n Brunei is divided into four districts ( daerahs ) [97]  and 38 subdistricts ( mukims ). [55] \n The daerah of Temburong is physically separated from the rest of Brunei by the  Malaysian  state of  Sarawak . \n No. \n District \n Capital \n Population (2011 census) \n Area (km 2 ) \n 1. \n Belait \n Kuala Belait \n 60,744 \n 2,724 \n 2. \n Brunei-Muara \u00a0\u00a0 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n 279,924 \n 571 \n 3. \n Temburong \n Pekan Bangar \n 8,852 \n 1,304 \n 4. \n Tutong \n Pekan Tutong \n 43,852 \n 1,166 \n Kuala \nBelait \n Seria \n Liang \n Kuala \nBalai \n Labi \n Bukit \nSawat \n Sukang \n Melilas \n Telisai \n Ukong \n Rambai \n Lamunin \n Tanjong \nMaya \n Ki- \nudang \n Mukim \nKeriam \n Pekan Tutong \n Seng- \nkurong \n Pengkalan \nBatu \n Kilanas \n Kianggeh \n Lumapas \n BPA \n Peramu \n Saba \n Sungai \nKebun \n KB \n GA \n GB \n BA \n BB \n Tamoi \n Sungai Kedayan \n Mentiri \n Serasa \n Labu \n Bangar \n Batu \nApoi \n Bokok \n Amo \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Belait \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Tutong \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Brunei-Muara \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Temburong \n The daerah of Brunei-Maura includes Brunei's capital city,  Bandar Seri Begawan , whose suburbs dominate fifteen of the eighteen mukims in this daerah. \n Over 90% of Brunei's total population lives in 15 of the 38 mukims: \n Rank \n Mukim \n Population \n Large Towns \n Daerah \n 1 \n Sengkurong \n 62,400 \n Jerudong  and  Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 2 \n Gadong B \n 59,610 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 3 \n Berakas A \n 57,500 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 4 \n Kuala Belait \n 35,500 \n Belait  town \n Belait \n 5 \n Seria \n 32,900 \n Seria  Town \n Belait \n 6 \n Berakas B \n 23,400 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 7 \n Sungai Liang \n 18,100 \n small  kampongs  (villages) \n Belait \n 8 \n Pengkalan Batu \n approx. 15,000 \n small kampongs \n Brunei-Muara \n 9 \n Kilanas \n approx. 14,000 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 10 \n Kota Batu \n 12,600 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 11 \n Pekan Tutong \n 12,100 \n Tutong Town \n Tutong \n 12 \n Mentiri \n 10,872 \n small kampongs \n Brunei-Muara \n 13 \n Serasa \n approx. 10,000 \n Muara Town \n Brunei-Muara \n 14 \n Kianggeh \n 8,540 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n 15 \n Burong Pinggai Ayer \n approx. 8,200 \n Bandar Seri Begawan \n Brunei-Muara \n Economy \n Main articles:  Economy of Brunei  and  Tourism in Brunei \nGraphical depiction of Brunei's product exports \n BIMP-EAGA  meeting in the office of Brunei Prime Minister on 25 April 2013. From left: Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Indonesian President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , Malaysian Representative and Filipino President  Benigno Aquino III . Brunei is part of the BIMP-EAGA, a subregional economic co-operation initiative in Southeast Asia. \n Brunei's small, wealthy  economy  is a mixture of  foreign  and  domestic  entrepreneurship, government regulation,  welfare  measures, and village tradition. [98]   Crude oil  and natural gas production account for about 90% of its GDP. [55]  About 167,000 barrels (26,600\u00a0m 3 ) of oil are produced every day, making Brunei the fourth-largest producer of oil in Southeast Asia. [55]  It also produces approximately 25.3\u00a0million cubic metres (890 \u00d7 10 ^ 6 \u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of  liquified natural gas  per day, making Brunei the ninth-largest exporter of the substance in the world. [55] \n Substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. Most of these investments are made by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the Ministry of Finance. [55]  The government provides for all medical services, [99]  and subsidises rice [100]  and housing. [55] \n The national  air carrier ,  Royal Brunei Airlines , is trying to develop Brunei as a modest hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Central to this strategy is the position that the airline maintains at London Heathrow Airport. It holds a daily slot at the highly capacity-controlled airport, which it serves from Bandar Seri Begawan via Dubai. The airline also has services to major Asian destinations including Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore and Manila. \n Brunei depends heavily on imports such as agricultural products (e.g. rice,  food products , livestock, etc.), [101]   motorcars  and  electrical products  from other countries. [102]  Brunei imports 60% of its food requirements; of that amount, around 75% come from the ASEAN countries. [101] \n Brunei's leaders are very concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal  social cohesion . But, it has become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum. Leaders plan to upgrade the  labour  force, reduce unemployment, which was at 6.9% in 2014; [103]  strengthen the banking and tourism sectors, and, in general, broaden the economic base. [104] \n The government of Brunei has also promoted food self-sufficiency, especially in  rice . Brunei renamed its Brunei Darussalam Rice 1 as Laila Rice during the launch of the \"Padi Planting Towards Achieving Self-Sufficiency of Rice Production in Brunei Darussalam\" ceremony at the Wasan padi fields in April 2009. [105]  In August 2009, the Royal Family reaped the first few Laila padi stalks, after years of attempts to boost local rice production, a goal first articulated about half a century ago. [106]  In July 2009 Brunei launched its national  halal  branding scheme, Brunei Halal, with a goal to export to foreign markets. [107] \n Infrastructure \nBrunei International Airport \nRoyal Brunei  Boeing 787 Dreamliner  at London  Heathrow Airport . \n The population centres in the country are linked by a network of 2,800 kilometres (1,700\u00a0mi) of road. The 135-kilometre (84\u00a0mi) highway from Muara Town to Kuala Belait is being upgraded to a  dual carriageway . [75] \n Brunei is accessible by air, sea, and land transport.  Brunei International Airport  is the main entry point to the country.  Royal Brunei Airlines [108]  is the national carrier. There is another airfield, the  Anduki Airfield , located in  Seria . The ferry terminal at Muara services regular connections to  Labuan  (Malaysia). Speedboats provide passenger and goods transportation to the Temburong district. [109]  The main highway running across Brunei is the Tutong-Muara Highway. The country's road network is well developed. Brunei has one main sea port located at Muara. [55] \n The airport in Brunei is currently being extensively upgraded. [110]  Changi Airport International is the consultant working on this modernisation, which planned cost is currently $150 million. [111] [112]  This project is slated to add 14,000 square metres (150,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of new floorspace and includes a new terminal and arrival hall. [113]  With the completion of this project, the annual passenger capacity of the airport is expected to double from 1.5 to 3 million. [111] \n With one private car for every 2.09 persons, Brunei has one of the highest car ownership rates in the world. This has been attributed to the absence of a comprehensive transport system, low import tax, and low unleaded petrol price of B$0.53 per litre. [75] \n A new 30-kilometre (19\u00a0mi) roadway  connecting the Muara and Temburong  districts of Brunei is slated to be completed in 2019. [114]  Fourteen kilometres (9\u00a0mi) of this roadway would be crossing the  Brunei Bay . [115]  The bridge cost is $1.6 billions. \n Banking \n Bank of China  has just (April 2016) received permission to open a branch in Brunei.  Citibank , which entered in 1972, closed its operations in Brunei in 2014.  HSBC , which had entered in 1947, is currently in the process of closing its operations in the country. [116] \n Demographics \n Main article:  Demographics of Brunei \n Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque  at night. \n Ethnicities indigenous to Brunei include the  Belait ,  Brunei Bisaya  (not to be confused with the Bisaya/Visaya of the nearby Philippines), indigenous  Bruneian Malay ,  Dusun ,  Kedayan ,  Lun Bawang ,  Murut  and  Tutong . \n The population of Brunei in 2016 was 423,196 of which 76% live in urban areas. The rate of urbanisation is estimated at 2.13% per year from 2010 to 2015. The average life expectancy is 77.7 years. [117]  In 2014, 65.7% of the population were  Malay , 10.3% are  Chinese , 3.4% are indigenous, with 20.6% smaller groups making up the rest. [118]  The official  language of Brunei  is  Malay . The Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports supports for a lingual movement aimed at the increased use of the language in Brunei [ why? ] . [119] \n The principal spoken language is  Melayu Brunei  ( Brunei Malay ). Brunei Malay is rather divergent from standard Malay and the rest of the Malay dialects, being about 84% cognate with standard Malay, [120]  and is mostly mutually unintelligible with it. [121] \n English and Chinese are also widely spoken, English is also used in business, as a  working language , and as the language of instruction from primary to tertiary education, [122] [123] [124] [125]  and there is a relatively large  expatriate  community. [126] \n Most expat are coming from non-Muslim countries such as Australia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, The Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and  India . \n Other languages and dialects spoken include  Arabic ,  Kedayan Malay  dialect,  Tutong Malay dialect ,  Murut  and  Dusun . [120] \n Religion \n Main article:  Religion in Brunei \n Religion in Brunei \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Islam  (67%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Buddhism  (13%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Christianity  (10%) \n \u00a0 \u00a0indigenous beliefs and non-religious, Atheist or Agnostic (10%) \n Islam  is the official religion of Brunei, [26]  specifically that of the  Sunni  branch, as dictated by the Madhhab of  Shafi'i . Two-thirds of the population, including the majority of  Bruneian Malays  and  Bruneian Chinese , adhere to Islam. Other faiths practised are  Buddhism  (13%, mainly by the Chinese) and  Christianity  (10%). [26]   Freethinkers , mostly Chinese, form about 7% of the population. Although most of them practise some form of religion with elements of Buddhism,  Confucianism , and  Taoism , they prefer to present themselves as having practised no religion officially, hence labelled as  atheists  in official censuses. Followers of indigenous religions are about 2% of the population. [127] \n Languages \n Main article:  Languages of Brunei \n The official language of Brunei is  Standard Malay . The local dialect,  Melayu Brunei  (Brunei Malay), is the most widely spoken language. \n English  is widely used as a business and official language and it is spoken by a majority of the  population in Brunei . \n The  Chinese minority  in Brunei speak a number of  Chinese varieties . \n Arabic  (\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a) is the religious language of  Muslims . Therefore, Arabic is taught in schools, particularly religious schools, and also in institutes of higher learning. As of 2004, there are six Arabic schools and one religious teachers' college in Brunei. A majority of Brunei's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the  Arabic language  as part of their religious education. \n Culture \n Main article:  Culture of Brunei \nRoyal Regalia Museum \n The culture of Brunei is predominantly  Malay  (reflecting its ethnicity), with heavy influences from  Islam , but is seen as much more conservative than  Indonesia  and  Malaysia . [128]  Influences to Bruneian culture come from the Malay cultures of the  Malay Archipelago . Four periods of cultural influence have occurred, animist,  Hindu , Islamic, and Western. Islam had a very strong influence, and was adopted as Brunei's ideology and philosophy. Brunei's official main language is  Malay  but English is also widely spoken as it is a compulsory subject in the majority of the schools. [129] \n As a  Sharia  country, the sale and public consumption of alcohol is banned. [130]  Non-Muslims are allowed to bring in a limited amount of alcohol from their point of embarkation overseas for their own private consumption. [75] \n Media \n Main article:  Media of Brunei \n Media in Brunei are said to be  pro-government . The country has been given \"Not Free\" status by  Freedom House ; press criticism of the government and monarchy is rare. [131]  Nonetheless, the press is not overtly hostile toward alternative viewpoints and is not restricted to publishing only articles regarding the government. The government allowed a printing and publishing company, Brunei Press PLC, to form in 1953. The company continues to print the English daily  Borneo Bulletin . This paper began as a weekly community paper and became a daily in 1990 [75]  Apart from The  Borneo Bulletin , there is also the  Media Permata  and Pelita Brunei, the local Malay newspapers which are circulated daily.  The Brunei Times  is another English independent newspaper published in Brunei since 2006. [132] \n The Brunei government owns and operates six television channels with the introduction of digital TV using DVB-T (RTB 1, RTB 2, RTB 3 (HD), RTB 4, RTB 5 and RTB New Media (Game portal)) and five radio stations (National FM, Pilihan FM, Nur Islam FM, Harmony FM and Pelangi FM). A private company has made cable television available (Astro-Kristal) as well as one private radio station, Kristal FM. [75]  It also has an online campus radio station,  UBD FM  that streams from its first university,  Universiti Brunei Darussalam ' [133] \n Sport \n The most popular sport in Brunei is  association football . The  Brunei national football team  joined  FIFA  in 1969, but has not had much success. The top two football leagues are the  Brunei Super League  and the  Brunei Premier League . \n Brunei debuted  at the Olympics  in 1996; it has competed at all subsequent  Summer Olympics  except 2008. The country has competed in badminton, shooting, swimming, and track-and-field, but is yet to win any medals. Brunei has had slightly more success  at the Asian Games , winning four bronze medals. The first major international sporting event to be hosted in Brunei was the  1999 Southeast Asian Games . According to the  all-time Southeast Asian Games medal table , Bruneian athletes have won a total of 11 gold medals at the games; only  East Timor  has won fewer. \n Legal system \n Brunei has numerous courts in its judicial branch. The highest court is the Supreme Court, which consists of the Court of Appeal and High Court. Both of these have a chief justice and two judges. [26] \n Women and children \n Main article:  Women in Brunei \n The U.S. Department of State has stated that discrimination against women is a problem in Brunei. [134]  The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and  caning . The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years, and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalise spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010. The penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months. \n Citizenship is derived through one's parents rather than through birth within the country's territory. Parents with stateless status are required to apply for a special pass for a child born in the country; failure to register a child may make it difficult to enroll the child in school. By law sexual intercourse with a female under 14 years of age constitutes rape and is punishable by imprisonment for not less than eight years and not more than thirty years and not less than twelve strokes of the cane. The intent of the law is to protect girls from exploitation through prostitution and \"other immoral purposes\" including pornography. [134] \n Human rights \n Main articles:  Freedom of religion in Brunei  and  LGBT rights in Brunei \n Brunei's revised penal code came into force on 22 April 2014, stipulating the  death penalty  for numerous offenses (both violent and non-violent), such insult or defamation of the Prophet Mohammed, insulting any verses of the Quran and Hadith,  blasphemy , declaring oneself a prophet or non-Muslim, robbery, rape, adultery, sodomy, extramarital sexual relations for Muslims and murder. Stoning to death was the specified \"method of execution for crimes of a sexual nature.\" Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) declared that, \"Application of the death penalty for such a broad range of offences contravenes international law.\"  [135] \n Male and female  homosexuality  is  illegal in Brunei . The country passed a law that came into force on 22 April 2014, allowing the death penalty to be administered by  stoning  for homosexual acts, such as sexual intercourse, given there is enough evidence pointing to the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). It has been acknowledged as a crime in Brunei with the introduction of the  Sharia  law. [136]  The law also stipulates that adultery is to be punished with death by stoning given there is enough evidence pointing to the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). Without four qualified witnesses, there will be no stoning. [137] \n As of August 2015, there were no cases within the Sharia Penal Code that would entail the death penalty without four qualified witnesses. [137] \n Religious rights \n Upon adopting sharia, the Sultan banned  Christmas  decorations in public places such as shopping malls, believing that it might interfere with the practise of Islam. [138]  However, local and foreign Christians are still allowed to celebrate Christmas as usual. On 25 December 2015, 4,000 out of 18,000 estimated local Catholics attended the mass of Christmas Day and Christmas Eve. [139] \n \"To be quite honest there has been no change for us this year; no new restrictions have been laid down, although we fully respect and adhere to the existing regulations that our celebrations and worship be [confined] to the compounds of the church and private residences,\" according to  Bishop Cornelius Sim , head of the Catholic Church in Brunei. [139] \n Animal rights \n Brunei is the first country in Asia to ban shark finning nationwide. [140] \n Selling other rare animals, such as  pangolins  and endangered birds, are considered serious crimes; however, Brunei lacks animal rights [ clarification needed ]  enforcers. \n Health \n See also:  List of hospitals in Brunei \n There are four government-run hospitals in Brunei, one for every district. There are also 16 health centres and 10 health clinics. [141] \n Healthcare in Brunei is charged at B$1 per consultation for citizens [142]  and is free for anyone under 12 years old. [142]  A health centre run by Brunei Shell Petroleum is located in  Panaga . For medical assistance not available in the country, citizens are sent overseas at the government's expense. [143]  In the period of 2011\u201312, 327 patients were treated in Malaysia and Singapore at the cost to the government of $12 million. [144] \n Brunei has 2.8 hospital beds per 1000 people. [26]  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is currently at 0.1%, [26]  and numerous AIDS awareness campaigns are currently being held. [145] \n 7.5% of the population are obese, the highest prevalence rate in  ASEAN . [146] [147]  Also, studies by the Ministry of Health show that at least 20% of schoolchildren in Brunei are either overweight or obese. [148] \n The largest hospital in Brunei is  Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital  (RIPAS) hospital, which had 550 beds in year 1992, [149]  is situated in the country's capital  Bandar Seri Begawan . There are two private medical centres, Gleneagles JPMC Sdn Bhd . [150]  and  Jerudong Park Medical Centre . The Health Promotion Centre opened in November 2008 and serves to educate the public on the importance of having a healthy lifestyle. [151] \n There is currently no  medical school  in Brunei, and Bruneians wishing to study to become doctors must attend university overseas. However, the Institute of Medicines had been introduced at the  Universiti Brunei Darussalam  and a new building has been built for the faculty. The building, including research lab facilities, was completed in 2009. There has been a School of Nursing since 1951. [152]  Fifty-eight nurse managers were appointed in RIPAS to improve service and provide better medical care.
