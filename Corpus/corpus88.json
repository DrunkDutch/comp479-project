As we continue to witness large-scale climate change, as well as political and economic crises worldwide, we require scholars and community sector professionals to reflect on how they can contribute to progressive change and lead projects that inspire civic engagement. \n The Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development provides you with an environment to investigate Quebec and Canada\u2019s social and solidarity economy in a broader context. Our  faculty members  are actively involved in the community and social economy sector, allowing you to benefit from their scholarship and practical knowledge as you explore the evolution of community economic development, community organizing and different theories of economic change. In today\u2019s context this includes the new and growing interest in social innovation as it generates uncharted paths for community based social and economic transformation. \n Our diverse student body is comprised of community sector professionals and students with volunteer experience in a variety of organizations. Many courses in our curriculum are participatory and enriched by the collective experiences of our cohort.\u00a0 Montreal\u2019s own history of community-based activism and economic development will serve as a backdrop as you participate in a field project with a community organization. \n Program Details \n                    Degree requirements\r\n Requirements for the Diploma \n To obtain the Graduate Diploma in CED, students will have to obtain a minimum of 30 course credits and a minimum GPA of 2.70.
