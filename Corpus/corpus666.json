[12]  Her father has a prominent political background as her paternal great-great-grandfather was Leonard Henry Alden, Mayor of Oxford from 1936-37. [13]  Her parents legally wed in August 2003. [14] [15] [16] [17] \n As a baby, her mother originally intended to name her \"Annie\" after the character  Little Orphan Annie  but decided against it, \"as I'd probably be a curly red head!\" Darcey-Alden explained. [18] \n She has a younger brother, Joseph (b. 18 February 2002) who is also an actor [19]  and two older half-siblings, James Philip (b. 1990), a doctor at  Colchester General Hospital [20]  and Rebecca Charlotte \"Becki\" Alden (b. 1992), who is presently engaged, [21] [22] [23] [24]  both from her father's first marriage in April 1990. [25] \n She is a former pupil of Dance 10 Theatre School within Edward Feild Primary School (named after Bishop  Edward Feild , respectively) in  Kidlington  which she attended from 2005 to 2011 [3] [6]  and of  Stagecoach Theatre Arts School  under the instruction of Maya Sprigg in Oxford until 2013 where she moved to Elite Dance Studio in  Los Angeles  until 2015. [26]  In late August 2014, she began attending  Palos Verdes High School  and is set to graduate in 2018. [27]  In Spring 2015 of her Freshman year, she joined her school's Choreo dance team, an advanced dance class that has students perform at pep rallies, community events, sporting events, and at their annual Spring Concert. [28] [29]  She additionally divides her time with the drama department. [30] \n In July 2017, she joined the  RADA  Youth Company: Acting summer term, training under Trilby James in contemporary text and  Shakespeare . [2] \n Career [ edit ] \n 2007\u20132009: Early work [ edit ] \n Darcey-Alden first broke into the world of acting in 2007, appearing in small roles on the British stage and television, including her stage debut in  Aladdin,  directed by  Peter Duncan  for the  Oxford Playhouse  and followed by an uncredited role in the 2008 mini-series  Tess of the D'Urbervilles . [2] [31] [6]  She began training in specialised dancing much earlier in 2005, with the Dance 10 Theatre School within Edward Feild Primary School in  Kidlington . [3] \n In 2009, she appeared in her first guest-starring role as Mary in  one episode  of  Robin Hood  and in select episodes as Emma Walker in  Holby City \u2014both for the  BBC . She auditioned for the latter part earlier in June that year, accompanied by her mother, and was cast at the age of 9. Commenting on the experience, Darcey-Alden said: \"It was very entertaining and a very good experience. I really, really enjoyed it. [Co-stars Jade Jackson and  Patsy Kensit ] were really nice, funny and entertaining. I want to be like Patsy Kensit when I am older because she is such a good actress. I am a big  Holby City  fan and I am really excited about seeing it on the television. All my friends and family are coming to watch it with me.\" [3] \n That year, she appeared in further stage credits, including  Adrian Noble 's musical production of  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang  for the  New Theatre Oxford  which was a revamped production of the  original 2002 London production [32]  and the  Mardi Gras  Challenge, a UK dance competition at the  Sadler's Wells Theatre . [33] [2] \n She later commented at a 2013  LeakyCon  panel in London on which form of media she preferred more\u2014theatre, TV or film: \"I love both. I actually started out doing theatre first and worked my way into TV and film. [...] I don't mind either, really. It's great!\" [34] [35] \n 2009\u20132011:  Harry Potter [ edit ] \n Darcey-Alden's most notable role came in December 2009, when she attended an open  audition  for the latest  Harry Potter  installment (a year before she was actually needed due to the producers' decision to split the  book  into two parts). On 25 January 2010, she was called back for a second audition at  Pinewood Studios  where she met director  David Yates  and worked with a number of other potentials for the parts of young James Potter, Sirius Black, Severus Snape and Lily Evans. During the process, the children were asked to improvise short conversations. She subsequently received a  screen test  with then 13-year-old Benedict Clarke (who would be cast as young  Severus Snape ) at  Leavesden Studios  \"as well as an associated costume, hair and makeup meeting.\" A few weeks later in February, she was contacted by the producers and was told that she received the part of young  Lily Evans , cast at age 10, in the commercially successful  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 . [36] [37] [38] [39]  In the film, Darcey-Alden appears in a  flashback sequence  as  Harry 's mother in her schooldays and reveals how she befriended Snape as child, which is crucial in explaining the back story of the shady professor and his complex relationship to Harry's deceased parents, particularly his bitter resentment to his father  James . [40] [41] \n It was revealed in a 2011 article for the  Oxford Mail  that years before landing the part Darcey-Alden was tipped for future success by her agents at  Enfield , London-based casting and theatrical agency A&J Management, although her parents decided to not treat her passion for acting seriously until she was more mature. Despite this, she resisted her mother for a chance in the business, especially for a part in  Harry Potter , a role which her mother initially did not believe she would eventually win. In the same article, it was further reported that she was not allowed to tell her close friends of her part in  Potter  as she left school for Leavesden Studios and  Hatfield House  to film her scenes, when she met then 21-year-old actor  Daniel Radcliffe  on her first day on set during her screen-test. She was quoted: \"I am still trying to get over that I am actually in  Harry Potter . When I got the part, I was so happy I was speechless. It was the best time of my life. It was very funny. Everyone was so friendly to me and it was really fun. At first, it was really difficult to keep the secret. But when my friends did find out, they were so happy for me and supported me all the way through it.\" [6] [42] \n At a 2013  LeakyCon  panel in  Portland, Oregon , Darcey-Alden further elaborated on her meeting with  Potter  co-star Daniel Radcliffe. She said: \n \"This story is when I just had my screen test for  Harry Potter . [...] I'm leaving, and the car is waiting outside and I was thinking, 'Alright.' And I got my stuff together, and I was just about to leave and the second  AD  came up and said, 'Oh, come up to my office. I got something for you, I got someone to see of you.' I thought, 'Okay, this is a bit weird.' And so I came up there and she was [like], 'Oh yeah, I'd just like you to meet Dan [Radcliffe]. And I thought, 'Oh my God! Hi! Hi, I'm Ellie!' And inside my heart's going  boom-boom-boom-boom-boom ! [...] And [Dan was] like, 'Hi! I guess I'll call you Mum!' And I'm like, 'Okay!' [...] And then he's like, to my mum, he said, 'Oh, you must be Grandma, then.' And Mum's like, 'Yeah, sure!' And I'm thinking, 'No, Mum!' [...] And I was so relaxed and thought, 'Oh yeah...' We're just having a conversation [...] and the second AD said, 'Look, the car's waiting, we've got to go, this is your quick hello-goodbye.' And so, [Dan is] so nice and was just like, 'Oh, I'm really sorry to keep you waiting, oh my God!' And I said, 'Okay, bye!' And I shake his hand and he's like, 'I'll see you around then!' And then I walked away [...] and I'm shaking his hand [...] and was like, 'I'm never washing this hand again!' And Mum looked at me and she turned around to look at Dan. Dan went (gestures), 'Alright!' [...] And Mum's like, 'You played it so cool and you just messed it all up!' And I'm like, 'I'm sorry!'\" [43] \n Filming her scenes along with Benedict Clarke (young Snape), Ariella Paradise (young  Petunia Dursely ),  Alfie McIlwain  (young James) and Rohan Gotobed (young  Sirius Black ) took place in April 2010. [44]  Shooting only lasted four days where one scene was shot per day [45]  while re-shoots and pick-ups were completed in early 2011. [30] \n According to Darcey-Alden and Clarke at a 2013  LeakyCon  cast junket in London, production alternated between sets at Leavesden Studios and  on location  shooting by the  River Lea  in the  gardens of Hatfield Park  near Hatfield House\u2014both set in  Hertfordshire , respectively. Of the river scene in particular, Clarke elaborated by saying: \n \"[W]e did so many ludicrous camera angles, we had a camera up on a crane looking down at Ellie and I. And we had a camera crew coming across the river on a boat for one of those, and then they could play around [...] decide what they wanted, how they wanted to pan across the river and take a look at us. I thought it was really outstanding how they had such a ridiculous extent of angles to play with.\" [46] \n Darcey-Alden added: \"We only did half-and-half at Leavesden. [...] There was the actual Hatfield House there and we got to have a look around and it was really beautiful.\" [46] \n Once location shoots were completed, Darcey-Alden and Clarke joined McIlwain and Gotobed at Leavesden on the set of the Great Hall where the set was divided with one section of the Entrance Hall in ruins for the Battle of Hogwarts sequences; two days of shooting were completed from morning until evening, scheduled a week apart where three hours of school tutoring was provided. [47]  Darcey-Alden mentioned in a LeakyCon 2013 panel session that she worked with  Dame Maggie Smith  the first half of the day and was quoted, jokingly: \"She spoke to me. It's not my fault.\" [42] \n She later said in detail: \n \"When I was filming my Great Hall scene where I had to be sorted, we were rehearsing and I think it was sorting off-camera and I sat on the stool and the Sorting Hat was sort of next to me and I looked down and was thinking, 'Wow! It's the Sorting Hat. Okay!' [...] And then there was Maggie Smith behind me and I've been told, you know, give her a bit of space. You know, let her breathe [and] if she comes up to you, don't talk to her. And I was thinking, 'Oh, I'm really nervous!' Because I've been told not to say anything, not to talk her, just to sit there. And then she comes up to me and she's like, 'Oh, you have beautiful hair!' And I'm like this (mimics gawking), 'Oh my goodness, that's Maggie Smith!' And she's like, 'You have really beautiful hair! Well done! You're really catchy! Good job!' And I'm like, Thanks... Oh my God!' But because I was so nervous on set and that was the first scene I did, it kind of gave me more confidence. [...] Even though it wasn't advice, it just gave me more confidence to be myself and just have fun and relax and everything. And [Smith is] such a lovely lady. She just comes up to you and talks to you.\" [48] \n A week later, a final day of shooting commenced in the Hogwarts corridor where multiple takes had the four child actors walk and run up the corridor numerous times. The original cut had McIlwain and Gotobed chase a first year Slytherin student, though this detail was eventually omitted. \"Though originally the scene was without dialogue,\" Gotobed revealed in a blog post, \"I suggested to [David Yates] that I say 'Snivellus' as we pushed through Snape and Lily. David agreed that was a good idea, and even gave me a second line later on in the day, where I was supposed to say 'come on James' at the end of the brief scene. As you already know, both lines were cut for release in favour of [Radcliffe]'s voiceover [sic], which makes more sense in terms of the entire montage.\" [47] \n To satisfy the look of her character as described in the books, Darcey-Alden is naturally red-haired although she was required to wear blue contact lenses to match Daniel Radcliffe's eyes, given her eyes are brown, as revealed by her co-star Benedict Clarke. [2] [49]  Darcey-Alden herself later confirmed that she wore contacts in January 2015 when she acted as a special guest in a  Harry Potter  celebration at the Riverview Middle School in  New Brunswick , Canada via a live Q&A over  Skype  with a winning classroom. She said: \n \"I don't know if you [the class] know what a screen test is, you haven't got the part yet. [...] You stand in front of (sic) a green screen in costume, hair, make-up, everything as if you got the part. And then they stand you next to whoever you'll be filming with. So, I stood next to Benedict [Clarke]. And I also stood next to Ariella [Paradise]. And so I stood there in hair, and make-up and everything and after that, [I] got off [for] a couple of hours and I was wearing contacts, [they] took the contacts out, put them in, had my hair up, put it down again...\" [50] [51] [52] \n Later, on 23 July 2015, she released a photo on Twitter of herself with Daniel Radcliffe posing on the set of  Harry Potter  to celebrate Radcliffe's 26th birthday, which further supported the fact that she had worn blue colour contacts. [53] \n In the  novels , Harry is described as having his mother's eyes, which are in fact green although Radcliffe never sported any colour-correcting contacts in the films due to a negative reaction to them;  J.K. Rowling  later commented on this by saying it was not an absolute need that Harry have green eyes in the films, as long as there was a resemblance between his and his mother's. [54]  However, the method of using blue contacts ultimately backfired and Darcey-Alden's natural eye colour showed through when captured on camera. For an unknown reason, this error was not digitally corrected in  post-production . [49] [55] [56] \n When later asked by a fan of what it was like to be a part of a popular movie  franchise , Darcey-Alden commented: \"I'm not famous, people don't recognise me. I'm just a normal crazy 12 year old who was very lucky to be in such a huge film.\" [57] \n This section may  require  cleanup  to meet Wikipedia's  quality standards .

(April 2014)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n 2012\u20132013: Later projects and break from acting [ edit ] \n Darcey-Alden has since been cast in a variety of independent and larger budget films. It was announced on 20 July 2011 via the official A&J Management  Twitter  that she had been cast in a cameo role in  Welcome to the Punch , a British thriller co-starring  James McAvoy ,  Mark Strong  and  Harry Potter   alum   Peter Mullan . [58]  She appeared briefly in the aeroplane scene seated in the opposite aisle from  Elyes Gabel . [59]  Other roles include two short films,  Pranks , a children's ghost story concerning a 12-year-old orphan named Katie confronted by the spirit of her foster mother's dead son and  Sam & Isobel , a  coming of age  tale of two young children brought together within the confines of a woodland through childlike innocence and naivety, although Sam eventually realises that Isobel is not as innocuous as she seems.  Pranks  co-starred her real life brother Joseph Darcey-Alden, [60]  was shot in four days on location at  Cuckmans Farm ,  St Albans  and was released to the public in April 2016. [61] [62]   Sam & Isobel  began filming on 9 April 2012 and wrapped production the following week on the 15th. [63] [64]  The official teaser trailer was released online on 2 April 2013 by director Brendan Lyle Moles. According to the video description, the film was making its circuit at film festivals that year and was planned to be released to the public afterwards. [65]  In early 2014, the film was officially released publicly online via Vimeo and YouTube by the production crew. [66] [67]  One review called her performance, \"ripened and complicated. [...] from the moment she begins to narrate her story, she sounds so sweetly young and yet so mature for a girl of 12 to 13 years of age, a maturity that is both engaged and a bit feverish. [...] Ultimately, this indication of maturity foreshadows who her character truly is, who may appear adorably innocent yet there's an edge of coldness beneath her given how she's not disturbed by many of her careless actions.\" [68] \n In 2012, she returned to the  BBC  for the  Doctor Who   series 7  Christmas special, \" The Snowmen \" as Francesca Latimer reuniting with real life brother Joseph Darcey-Alden as her on-screen sibling and co-starring alongside  Jenna-Louise Coleman  and  Matt Smith . [69] [70]  In the episode, set in London in 1892, Francesca \"Franny\" Latimer and her brother Digby are wards being cared for by their governess  Clara Oswin Oswald  under the alias \"Miss Montague\". The children share a much closer relationship with Clara than they do their own father and Franny decides to relate a troubling experience to her: she has been having frequent nightmares of her late governess who has been tormenting her in her dreams of a promised return on Christmas Eve; it is revealed that years earlier, the governess drowned in the Latimers' pond, now frozen. Through a series of events, Franny's nightmare manifests under the  Great Intelligence 's influence, the Ice Governess is destroyed with the help of  the Doctor , and Clara tragically succumbs to internal injuries, mourned by the Latimers. [71] \n At a Chicago TARDIS 2014 panel, Darcey-Alden revealed that it was her brother who secured her the role. She said: \"That was actually my brother's doing. And he got me the part.\" [72] \n Joseph elaborated by saying: \n \"So the agent called and they said, 'Well, this is what you got to do.' And I'm like, 'Okay.' And he sent me the script and they phoned back and said, 'Oh, bring Ellie along.' And I was like, 'No, no, no. Don't bring Ellie along. I'm not just going to bring her to audition.' And they said, 'Okay.' [I] put the phone down, [they] ring back up and said, 'Okay, they'll see Ellie.' So we both went along to audition. They sent Ellie a script. They weren't auditioning girls until, I believe the week after.\" [72] \n Ellie continued: \"Couple of weeks after they were auditioning the sister role. So they were just doing the brothers and then they do the sisters after that. But we [...] just went in and we read together and we got a callback. The following couple of days after that, we got a callback and then it kind of went off with that.\" [72] \n The  read-through  took place on 2 August 2012 and was filmed later in the month in  BBC Wales '  Roath Lock  studios and  Newport . [70]  To date, Darcey-Alden is the latest in a line of  Harry Potter  cast members to have appeared in both  Potter  and  Doctor Who , including  David Tennant ,  Michael Gambon ,  Helen McCrory ,  John Cleese ,  Zoe Wanamaker ,  Jim Broadbent ,  Toby Jones ,  Roger Lloyd Pack ,  Bill Nighy ,  Shirley Henderson ,  Adrian Rawlins ,  David Bradley , and  John Hurt . [73] \n The same year, it was confirmed that she would guest star in the second season of  Tom Fontana 's French-German-Czech historical television drama  Borgia: Faith and Fear  (not to be confused with  Showtime 's  The Borgias ) as  Felice della Rovere , on-screen and illegitimate daughter to  Dejan \u010cuki\u0107 's Cardinal  Giuliano della Rovere  (better known as Pope Julius II). [74] [75]  Series two was shot  on location  in  Prague  and  Italy  in March through November 2012. [76]  Darcey-Alden filmed her scenes in Italy that October over the span of three days, sharing the screen alongside Matt Di'angelo and  Mark Ryder . [77] [78]  The show premiered on  Canal+  on 18 March 2013 [79]  and  Netflix  on 1 May 2013. [80] \n Although Felice is considered a powerful and influential historical figure, Darcey-Alden's part in the show is reduced to a minimal appearance in the shadow of her powerful father; based on documentation, Felice was married as early as 14 years of age and was widowed shortly after, years before she remarried Gian Giordano Orsini and subsequently became a prominent figure of the  Italian Renaissance . [81] \n While Darcey-Alden filmed minimal scenes for episodes 11 and 12, they were eventually cut from the final version, yet her name still appears in the credits of the Season 2 DVD (Region 2). [82] [83]  The show had been renewed for a third season, which was in  principal photography  as of May 2013; it had been confirmed that this was the final of the series. [84]  At the time, it was currently unknown whether Darcey-Alden's character would return to the show, though since the finale aired in France on Canal+ on 27 October 2014, her character had been cut. [85] \n Stage credits included Ellen Kent's  Aida Verdi  for the  New Theatre Oxford [2] [86]  and  The Nutcracker Twisted  (or  A Twisted Nutcracker ), an interpretation of the  original  which breaks away from classic ballet and includes tap, hip-hop, jazz, singing and some \"Gangnam Style.\" It was presented by Elite Dance Studio and performed at the Norris Theatre on 30 November 2013. [87] [88] [89] \n This would be her last foray into professional acting until she later revealed in January 2016 to  Live From 205 News  that her professional acting career was temporarily on hold, commenting that, \"Hollywood does not like a 16-year-old girl with braces. Next year when I get my braces off, I'll be out to start auditioning again.\" [30] [90] \n 2014-present: Amateur theatre, competitive dancing and upcoming projects [ edit ] \n On 23\u201326 May, she appeared in the  Showstopper!  Competition 2014 which took place at the  Disneyland Hotel  in California. [91] [92]  She competed in a ballet solo, ballet group, jazz group and contemporary group. [93]  She and her group were later awarded two Platinum 1st Place prizes with scores of 114.2 and 114.0, respectively for their performances \"Stranded\" and \"Hold It Against Me\" presented by Elite Dance Studio. [94] \n On 6\u20138 February, she appeared in the  KAR: Kids Artistic Revue  Long Beach, CA Competition 2015, which took place at Millikan High School. [95]  She additionally performed in the  Palos Verdes High School Choreo Show  2015 and returned for 2016, which was held at the James R. Armstrong Theatre in  Torrance  from 23\u201324 March. [96] [97] [98]  To date, she has one stagehand credit as a  British English   dialect coach  for Palos Verdes High School's production of  Noises Off , performed from 6-8, 12\u201315 November 2015. [99] [30]  Later, she was cast in her first acting role since 2013 in Palos Verdes High School's production of  Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , directed by Nicole Thompson as the Female Ensemble which was performed from 15-17, 21\u201324 April. [100] [101] [102]  The musical was later nominated for 15 John Raitt Awards for Youth, including Best Ensemble and took home one for Musical Comedy of the Year. [103] \n Other work [ edit ] \n Outside of screen and stage credits, she modelled small-time, including ads for  Morleys Stores Ltd  ca. 2009-10, [104]  Playworld Systems,  Nestle ,  Sodexo ,  Marks and Spencer , and  McCarthy and Stone , and was a front page model for the British children and pre-teen magazine  Girl Talk  in 2012 and 2013. [105] [106]  In January 2011, she appeared in a commercial for  Skype . [107] \n She has appeared at many  Harry Potter  events and other fan conventions over the years, including the  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1  cast and crew screening in October 2010, [108]  the  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2   world premiere  on 7\u00a0July\u00a02011 \u00a0( 2011-07-07 )  in  Trafalgar Square  in London, [6] [109] [110]   LeakyCon  2011 in  Orlando , Florida, [111]  the  Warner Bros.

[115]  In December 2012, she along with  Potter  alum Ryan Turner ( Hugo Weasley ) participated in the Leighton Christmas Festival. [116] [117] \n On 21 December 2013, she along with Elite Dance Studio performed for the  Los Angeles Clippers   Halftime Show . [118] \n She was scheduled to appear as a guest at  Gallifrey One  2014, a  science fiction  and  Doctor Who  fan convention, which took place 14\u201316 February at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott. [119]  It was announced that she would be returning to LeakyCon 2014, which took place in Orlando, Florida from 30 July to 3 August [120]  and played  Hermione Granger  in the Opening Ceremony. [121]  She and her brother Joseph appeared as guests at the Midwest's Premier  Doctor Who  event, Chicago TARDIS 2014 from 28\u201330 November at the Westin Lombard Yorktwon Center.
