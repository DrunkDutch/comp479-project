The date of composition of each is unknown, with the oldest probably from about 800 BCE and the youngest probably composed after the 15th-century CE. [1] [2]  The  Principal Upanishads  were composed in the 1st millennium BCE, [3]  most Yoga Upanishads composed probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period, [4]  and seven of the Sannyasa Upanishads composed before the 3rd century CE. [5] [6] \n Contents \n 1   The Canon \n 2   Transmission \n 3   Categories \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n The Canon [ edit ] \n The canon is part of a dialogue between  Rama  and  Hanuman . Rama proposes to teach  Vedanta , saying \"Even by reading one verse of them [any Upanishad] with devotion, one gets the status of union with me, hard to get even by sages.\" Hanuman enquires about the different kinds of \"liberation\" ( Mukti , hence the name of the Upanishad), to which Rama answers that \"the only real type [of liberation] is  Kaivalya \". [ citation needed ] \n The list of 108 Upanishads is introduced in verses 26-29: \n But by what means is the Kaivalya kind of  Moksha  got? The  Mandukya  is enough; if knowledge is not got from it, then study the Ten Upanishads. Getting knowledge very soon, you will reach my abode. If certainty is not got even then, study the 32 Upanishads and stop. If desiring Moksha without the body, read the 108 Upanishads. Hear their order. (trans. Warrier) [ full citation needed ] \n Some scholars list ten as principal \u2013 the  Mukhya Upanishads , while most consider twelve or thirteen as principal, most important Upanishads (highlighted). [7] [8] [9] \n The list of 108 names is given in verses 30-39. They are as follows: \n Isha Upanishad \n Kena Upanishad \n Katha Upanishad \n Prashna Upanishad \n Mundaka Upanishad \n Mandukya Upanishad \n Taittiriya Upanishad \n Aitareya Upanishad \n Chandogya Upanishad \n Brihadaranyaka Upanishad \n Brahma Upanishad \n Kaivalya Upanishad \n Jabala Upanishad \n Shvetashvatara Upanishad \n Hamsopanishad \n Aruneya Upanishad \n Garbhopanishad \n Narayanopanishad \n Paramahamsopanishad \n Amritabindu Upanishad \n Nada Bindu Upanishad \n Atharvashiras Upanishad \n Atharvashikha Upanishad \n Maitrayaniya Upanishad \n Kaushitaki Upanishad \n Brihajjabala Upanishad \n Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad \n Kalagni Rudra Upanishad \n Maitreya Upanishad \n Subala Upanishad \n Kshurika Upanishad \n Mantrika Upanishad \n Sarvasara Upanishad \n Niralamba Upanishad \n Shukarahasya Upanishad \n Vajrasuchi Upanishad \n Tejobindu Upanishad \n Nada Bindu Upanishad \n Dhyanabindu Upanishad \n Brahmavidya Upanishad \n Yogatattva Upanishad \n Atmabodha Upanishad \n Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad \n Trishikhibrahmana Upanishad \n Sita Upanishad \n Yogachudamani Upanishad \n Nirvana Upanishad \n Mandala-brahmana Upanishad \n Dakshinamurti Upanishad \n Sharabha Upanishad \n Skanda Upanishad \n Mahanarayana Upanishad \n Advayataraka Upanishad \n Rama Rahasya Upanishad \n Rama tapaniya Upanishad \n Vasudeva Upanishad \n Mudgala Upanishad \n Shandilya Upanishad \n Paingala Upanishad \n Bhikshuka Upanishad \n Maha Upanishad \n Sariraka Upanishad \n Yogashikha Upanishad \n Turiyatitavadhuta Upanishad \n Brihat-Sannyasa Upanishad \n Paramahamsa Parivrajaka Upanishad \n Malika Upanishad \n Avyakta Upanishad \n Ekakshara Upanishad \n Annapurna Upanishad \n Surya Upanishad \n Akshi Upanishad \n Adhyatma Upanishad \n Kundika Upanishad \n Savitri Upanishad \n Atma Upanishad \n Pashupatabrahma Upanishad \n Parabrahma Upanishad \n Avadhuta Upanishad \n Tripuratapini Upanishad \n Devi Upanishad \n Tripura Upanishad \n Kathashruti Upanishad \n Bhavana Upanishad \n Rudrahridaya Upanishad \n Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad \n Bhasma Upanishad \n Rudraksha Upanishad \n Ganapati Upanishad \n Darshana Upanishad \n Tarasara Upanishad \n Mahavakya Upanishad \n Pancabrahma Upanishad \n Pranagnihotra Upanishad \n Gopala Tapani Upanishad \n Krishna Upanishad \n Yajnavalkya Upanishad \n Varaha Upanishad \n Shatyayaniya Upanishad \n Hayagriva Upanishad \n Dattatreya Upanishad \n Garuda Upanishad \n Kali-Santarana Upanishad \n Jabali Upanishad \n Saubhagyalakshmi Upanishad \n Sarasvati-rahasya Upanishad \n Bahvricha Upanishad \n Muktik\u0101 Upanishad (this text) \n Transmission [ edit ] \n Almost all printed editions of ancient Vedas and Upanishads depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still-extant and superior oral tradition. [10]   Michael Witzel  explains this oral tradition as follows: \n The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a  tape-recording .... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. [11] \n Categories [ edit ] \n In this canon, \n 10  upani\u1e63ads  are associated with the  Rigveda  and have the  \u015b\u0101nti  beginning  va\u1e47me-manasi . \n 16  upani\u1e63ads  are associated with the  Samaveda  and have the  \u015b\u0101nti  beginning  \u0101py\u0101yantu . \n 19  upani\u1e63ads  are associated with the  Shukla Yajurveda  and have the  \u015b\u0101nti  beginning  p\u016br\u1e47amada . \n 32  upani\u1e63ads  are associated with the  Krishna Yajurveda  and have the  \u015b\u0101nti  beginning  sahan\u0101vavatu . \n 31  upani\u1e63ads  are associated with the  Atharvaveda  and have the  \u015b\u0101nti  beginning  bhadram-kar\u1e47ebhi\u1e25 . \n The first 13 are grouped as  mukhya  (\"principal\"). 21 are grouped as  S\u0101m\u0101nya Ved\u0101nta  (\"common  Vedanta \"), The remainder are associated with five different schools or sects within Hinduism, 20 with  Sanny\u0101sa  (asceticism), 8 with  Shaktism , 14 with  Vaishnavism , 12 with  Shaivism  and 20 with  Yoga . \n \u00a0 \n Shukla Yajurveda \n Krishna Yajurveda \n Atharvaveda \n Samaveda \n \u1e5agveda \n Mukhya ; [9] \n these form the core of ancient texts, predating classical Hinduism; they span the 1st millennium BCE and reflect the emergence of  Vedanta  from  Vedic religion . \n \u012a\u1e63a \n B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka \n Ka\u1e6dha \n Taittir\u012bya \n \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara \n Pra\u015bna \n Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka \n M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya \n Kena \n Ch\u0101ndogya \n Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i \n Kau\u015b\u012bt\u0101ki \n Aitareya \n S\u0101m\u0101nya ; \n These are general Upanishads, and do not focus on any specific post-classical Hindu tradition.
