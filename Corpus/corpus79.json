I learned solid statistical software skills through professors and classes offered by the department of Economics. Learning these skills was really helpful for my career and because of this, I could work more efficiently and practice a wide range of skills. This is one of the reasons of my promotion in the company. \n What do you value most from your Economics experience? \n My professors, my peers and the friends I made at Concordia. Also, I went to French classes held by the Graduate Students Association which turned out to be useful now. A third of my customers are French-speaking so I\u2019m able to communicate with them in French and read their documents in French. \n Is there a particular memory that stands out from your time at Concordia? \n Being a teaching assistant. Being able to help professors and undergraduate students. I was the teaching assistant for the undergraduate Accounting courses. It allowed me to be familiar with all kinds of customers\u2019 financial statements, from which I\u2019m able to analyze a customer\u2019s finance health.\u00a0\u00a0 \n What advice would you give to someone considering graduate studies in Economics? \n Work experience is as important as academic experience. Being a teaching assistant was my first job since I came to Canada, and it was a great asset to help me find other jobs when I graduated.\u00a0 \n Alumni profiles Carlos A.
