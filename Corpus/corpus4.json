As a union, CUFA\u2019s principal functions are to negotiate and to ensure the application of the Collective Agreement on a day-to-day basis.. We normally negotiate a Collective Agreement every 3 to 5 years. Ensuring that our members\u2019 rights as defined under the Collective Agreement and the law are protected is an on-going activity. We deal with issues involving workload, disciplinary matters, discrimination, harassment, denial of contract renewal, denial of tenure, denial of promotion, and termination. To do this work we can count on the hard work of our grievance officers, our in-house lawyer and our outside counsel. \n We hold membership in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des Professeures et Professeurs d\u2019Universit\u00e9 (FQPPU) and the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), which both represent our interests at the provincial, federal, and international levels.  We are also members of the CAUT Defence Fund, which provides material and moral support in the event of a strike. \n The CUFA offices are located in HB-109 on the Loyola campus. \n We want to hear from you! Come help us shape CUFA\u2019s future. \n Address: \n 7141 Sherbrooke St. West, \nMontreal, H4B 1R6 \nPhone: (514) 848-2424, extension 3999 \nFax: (514) 848-3997 \nEmail:  \n CUFA Member Suggestion Box \n Have a suggestion about negotiations or something else? \n\t\t\t Please share your input with us! \n   November 2017 \n Previous Month \n Next Month \n S M T W T F S \n 1 2 3 4 5   \n CUFA Council Meeting \n 9:30am - 11:25am / S-MB 9A \n\t\t\t\t6 7 8 9   \n Senate \n 2:00pm - 5:00pm / EV-2.260 \n\t\t\t\t10 11 12   \n CUFA Executive Meeting \n 12:00pm - 2:00pm / SGW TBD \n\t\t\t\t13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   \n CUFA 5 \u00e0 7 \u2013 November 23, 2017 \n 5:00pm - 7:00pm / JMSB Building, 9th Floor Rooms C and D \n\t\t\t\t23 24 25 26   \n CUFA Executive Meeting \n 10:00am - 12:00pm / L-HB109 \n\t\t\t\t27 28 29 30   \n On Twitter \n CUFA/APUC @cufa_apuc \n https://t.co/6nardwZ6Pq \n Sunday, November 5 \n CUFA/APUC @cufa_apuc \n In a Volatile Climate on Campus, Professors Teach on Tenterhooks  https://t.co/l0q7JJLHst \n Sunday, November 5 \n CUFA/APUC @cufa_apuc \n https://t.co/syt4neq01z \n Wednesday, October 18 \n Latest News \n Support for Professor Louise Briand, faculty representative on the UQO Board of Governors Read the letter of support from the FQPPU \n U Can\u2019t Talk to Ur Professor Like This \u2013 The New York Times Read the full story \n March for Science \u2013 April 22 12:00 pm View details about the March   Canadian Messaging \u2013 March for Science \n Conferences are intellectual lifelines \u2013 but as a single parent I often miss out Read the full story \n New study suggests female professors outperform men in terms of service Read the full story \n Contact Information \n General Inquiries \nChantal Bohbot: 514-848-2424 x3999 |  \n Inquiries about the Collective Agreement \nGenevieve Robichaud: 514-848-2424 x3984 |  \n View the Staff Directory \u00bb \n Mailing Address: \nHingston Hall \n7141 Sherbrooke Street West \nMontreal, H4B 1R6 \n Fax:  (514) 848-3997 \n                    Copyright \u00a9 2007-2014 Concordia University Faculty Association.                \n Contact the website developer \u00bb"}
