Dock Copse can be seen on the left bank. Bloomfield Copse is on the right bank. \n Country \n England \n Physical characteristics \n Main source \n Bishops Waltham ,  Hampshire . \n River mouth \n Southampton Water \n Length \n 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) \n The  River Hamble  is a  river  in  Hampshire , England. It  rises  near  Bishop's Waltham  and flows for some  7.5\u00a0miles (12\u00a0km)  through  Botley ,  Bursledon  and  Swanwick  before entering  Southampton Water  near  Hamble-le-Rice  and  Warsash . \n The  Hamble  is tidal for approximately half its length and is navigable in its lower reaches, which have facilitated shipbuilding activities since medieval times. Leisure craft are still built there today. \nOne of these builders was  Luke & co , later  Luke Bros , a reputed yard at Hamble from around 1890 to 1945. \n The river, and its shipbuilding yards, have also been used for military purposes, particularly during  World War II . \n Its lower reaches are now very popular for boating, being known throughout the  sailing  world as  The Heart of British Yachting \n Contents \n 1   Bishops Waltham to Botley (non-tidal) \n 2   Botley to Bursledon (tidal) - historic sites \n 3   Bursledon to Hamble (tidal) - modern playground \n 4   See also \n 5   References \n 6   External links \n Bishops Waltham to Botley (non-tidal) [ edit ] \nMedieval shipbuilding site on the River Hamble \nMedieval shipbuilding site on the River Hamble \nThe Yellow X marks the site of the wreck of HMS Grace Dieu \nRiver Hamble Estuary \n From its source near Bishop's Waltham, the river flows in a generally southerly direction picking up several small tributary streams before reaching  Botley , the site of an ancient watermill. \n Botley to Bursledon (tidal) - historic sites [ edit ] \n Below Botley, the river becomes tidal and navigable. It gains strength from adjoining streams, draining the surrounding areas of  Hedge End ,  Curdridge ,  Shedfield  and  Burridge . [1] \n This section has been extensively used for medieval shipbuilding, using timber grown locally in the neighbouring woods. Nearby Kings Copse, formerly Kings Forest, [2]  indicates the former importance of this area. \n The river's west bank can be accessed from  Manor Farm Country Park , where it is possible to walk through Dock Copse [1]  and Fosters Copse. [1]  At extreme low tide, it is just possible to see the remains of the wreck of Henry V's 15th century warship  HMS Grace Dieu . This section of the river was also home to  HMS Cricket  during  World War II . \n Some 2\u00a0miles (3\u00a0km) south of  Botley , the river passes between the villages of  Bursledon  and  Lower Swanwick  and is crossed by the  M27 motorway , the  Portsmouth  to  Southampton  railway line and the  A27 road  on three substantial bridges. \n Bursledon to Hamble (tidal) - modern playground [ edit ] \n A further 2\u00a0miles (3\u00a0km) south of Bursledon, the river flows between the villages of  Hamble-le-Rice  and  Warsash  before entering Southampton Water. [3] \n A passenger  ferry  crosses the river between Hamble-le-Rice and Warsash, forming an important link in the  Solent Way  and  E9 European Coastal Path . The river is also the location for several large  marinas , the largest being the Port Hamble Marina and  boat yards , situated on both banks as far upstream as Bursledon.
