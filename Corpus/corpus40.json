Some of our majors have previously studied communication. Others have not. Our programs of study have no prerequisite courses. Students are, however, expected to be sensitive to the significance of media in society. In addition, we require that applicants to our programs think clearly and express their ideas concisely, have creative potential, and are capable of group work.\u00a0 \n Our graduates  are well prepared for a number of careers. Many have entered the media as producers, directors, writers, reporters, researchers, production assistants, etc. Others work in related fields, such as advertising, public relations, marketing, and promotion. Some have become media consultants, while others go on to further study to prepare for careers as lawyers or scholars. \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Programs \n Faculty and staff \n Facilities \n Contact us \n Loyola Campus \n Department of Communication Studies \nCJ 3.230 \n 7141 Sherbrooke St W \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
