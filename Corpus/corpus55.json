It provides benefits that are defined ahead of time based on a set formula using your  pensionable earnings  and years of  credited service . \n As a result, your benefits are guaranteed and protected, regardless of economic or market conditions. Investment returns do not affect your defined benefits. The university is responsible for ensuring that the plan is sufficiently funded to provide the pension benefits that you earn under the plan. \n You automatically participate as a non-contributory member. This means you build retirement income under the plan without having to pay a cent! \n Or you may wish to be a contributory member. Why? You increase your benefits from the plan and your contributions are tax deductible. \n This section describes the Pension Plan for the Employees of Concordia University for members who are currently employed by the University. If you are not currently employed by the University, please contact  Pension Services  for details. \n As good as the plan may be, other sources of income are also essential to a comfortable retirement. Consult the  retirement planning section on Cspace  for details. \n You should seek the advice of a retirement, financial or tax specialist for help in your financial planning for retirement or in evaluating your current situation. \n Eligibility and enrolment \n Who is eligible? \n When to enroll? \n Full-time, permanent employee \n Automatically join the Pension Plan for the Employees of Concordia University as of your date of employment. \n Part-time or non-permanent employees but who have met one of the following qualifications in the previous calendar year: \n a minimum of 700 hours worked; or \n remuneration equal to at least 35% of the  YMPE . \n Join the plan on January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you meet one of the following qualifications: \n a minimum of 700 hours worked; or \n remuneration equal to at least 35% of the  YMPE . \n Health plan Road to health Dental plan Pension plan Required contributions Group RSP Life insurance plans Conversion privileges Government plans Accident insurance plan Conversion privileges Pensioners' Corner \n Quick links \n Glossary \n FAQ \n Calendar \n Useful Links \n Pensioners' Association \n Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) \n Canada Pension Plan (CPP) \n Old Age Security \n Please read \n The fine print \n Contact us \n For general pension inquiries, email:  pensions@concordia.ca \n Pension contacts \n HR contacts \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
