The latter seminar explores methodological issues relevant to the principal area of the student\u2019s research. It is chosen in consultation with the student\u2019s principal supervisor from among the numerous courses in methodology offered by different departments at Concordia University. Please note that special permission from the departments in question (Chair or Graduate Program Director and Instructor) is necessary in order to have access to these courses. Individualized Program courses are designated INDI with successive numbers in the 600 sequence for master\u2019s students and in the 800 sequence for doctoral students. \n INDI 800-819 Doctoral Level Studies  (6 credits) \n INDI 820-839 Doctoral Level Studies  (3 credits) \n INDI 840-884 Doctoral Level Studies  (variable credits) \n INDI 885 Doctoral Comprehensive Examination  (3 credits) \n INDI 886 Special Topics  (3 credits) \nThis optional seminar addresses a topic or range of topics of relevance to the research interests of a cross-section of the students enrolled in the program. \n INDI 887 Doctoral Thesis Proposal  (3 credits) \n INDI 890 Doctoral Research and Thesis  (66 credits) \n INDI 898 Doctoral Directed Research Course  (variable credits) \nThe student conducts research in a lab or another research site under the direction of his/her principal supervisor. \n Note:  The content will vary from term to term and from year to year. Students may re-register for this course, provided the course content has changed. Changes in content will be indicated by a letter following the course number, e.g. INDI 898A, INDI 898B, etc. These courses will be graded pass/fail. \n INDI 899 International Doctoral Level Studies  (3 credits) \n INDI 600-619 Master\u2019s Level Studies  (6 credits) \n INDI 620-639 Master\u2019s Level Studies  (3 credits) \n INDI 640-684 Master\u2019s Level Studies  (variable credits) \n INDI 686 Special Topics  (3 credits) \nThis optional seminar addresses a topic or range of topics of relevance to the research interests of a cross-section of the students enrolled in the program. \n INDI 687 Master\u2019s Thesis Proposal  (3 credits) \n INDI 690 Master\u2019s Research and Thesis  (24 credits) \n INDI 698 Master\u2019s Directed Research Course  (variable credits) \nThe student conducts research in a lab or another research site under the direction of his/her principal supervisor. \n Note:  The content will vary from term to term and from year to year. Students may re-register for this course, provided the course content has changed. Changes in content will be indicated by a letter following the course number, e.g. INDI 698A, INDI 698B, etc. These courses will be graded pass/fail. \n INDI 699 International Master\u2019s Level Studies  (3 credits) \n Comprehensive Examination \n At the doctoral level, students are required to write an examination testing their basic knowledge of the relevant areas of each component discipline comprising their program of study. The supervisory committee supplies the student with an appropriate reading list to prepare for this examination. \nStudents are additionally required to write a Doctoral Comprehensive Examination Essay (5000-6000 words) that integrates the component disciplines of the program of study in addressing a particular issue. The student makes a formal essay topic proposal to the supervisory committee which decides with the student boundaries and expectations for the essay. The student is then given three weeks to submit the essay. \n The supervisory committee evaluates these examinations; it may, however, consult with other faculty members in relevant areas where additional expertise is required for the evaluation. The principal supervisor submits the reading list, the questions, the answers/essay, and the evaluations along with the pass/fail grade to the INDI Director. \n Thesis \n A thesis in an Individualized Program represents a unique contribution to scholarship undertaken while the student is enrolled in the program. The master\u2019s and doctoral theses offered at this University in cognate areas will normally provide an appropriate guide to the format and scope of the Individualized Program thesis requirements. \n In the case of a nontraditional thesis \u2013 such as one involving a creative production \u2013 the requirement of scholarly contribution still applies. Thus, while a thesis may present a creative work as its central focus, it should nevertheless provide a scholarly discussion placing that work in the context of related ideas and works. As in the case of traditional theses, the nontraditional thesis is submitted to an oral examination where it is exposed to scholarly criticism and where the student is given an opportunity to defend it. \n The thesis defence must provide for the inclusion of one external examiner at the doctoral level. At the master\u2019s level, the thesis defence will include the student\u2019s principal supervisor and at least two other committee members, one of whom may be an external examiner. \n Top \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
