While you can customize your colors and backgrounds in Windows, the way your icons look is generally dictated by the person who writes the software. That is, unless you make your own icons! Whether you want to create one from scratch or shrink an image down to fit into the shape of an icon, you\u2019re just a few steps away from a truly customized Windows desktop. \n Steps Edit \n Method One of Four: Drawing an Icon From Scratch Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9d\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9d\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":349.42307692308,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":577.30769230769} \n 1 \n Choose a drawing program that can make .ico files.  An .ico file is a Windows icon file. Your Windows computer comes with Windows Paint, which will do the job. More advanced software like Photoshop and Gimp also allow you to draw icons.\n If Photoshop is your drawing software of choice, you\u2019ll need a safe, free plugin called ICO (Windows Icon Format) by Telegraphics. The plugin is available directly from the developer at http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/. Scroll down to ICO (Windows Icon Format), select your operating system, and choose a location to save the installer. For help installing Photoshop plugins, see  How to Install Plugins in Adobe Photoshop . \n You may have different drawing software than any of the above. Search the web to see if it can save .ico files. If so, you can still follow the steps, as most drawing applications are somewhat similar when it comes to these basic functions. \n You can use a Mac to create Windows icons, but you\u2019ll need to use Photoshop, Gimp, or another piece of software that works on MacOS (not Paint). \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/01\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/01\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":344.36813186813,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":568.95604395604} \n 2 \n Open your drawing program.  To open Paint, open the Start menu and select the search box. Type the word \u201cPaint\u201d and once the program appears in the search results, click the link. This method will work with Gimp and Photoshop as well.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c8\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c8\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n Create a new file that\u2019s 256 x 256 pixels large.  Your .ico file should be a perfect square, and It\u2019s a good idea to start with at least a 256 x 256 pixel canvas so you can see what you\u2019re doing. You can go larger, as long as both numbers are the same.\n In Paint, click \u201cResize,\u201d then select the radio button next to the word \u201cPixels.\u201d Type  256  into both the Horizontal and Vertical boxes, then select \u201cOK.\u201d \n In Photoshop, open the File menu and select \u201cNew.\u201d Type 256 in both the Width and Height boxes and click \u201cOK.\u201d Select \u201cPixels\u201d (not inches). You\u2019ll see an option to set a background color\u2014you can choose one if you wish, or select \u201cTransparent\u201d if you don\u2019t want your icon to have a solid color background. [1] \n In Gimp, open the File menu and select \u201cNew.\u201d Type 256 in both the Width and Height boxes (make sure Pixels is selected). Click \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d to see options for a background fill. If you want to set a background color, click \u201cFill With\u201d and either select a color or chose \u201cTransparency\u201d to have no background behind your design. Click OK.

To keep your drawing symmetrical, set your image program to show a grid in the background. This grid will not show up on your icon.\n Paint: Click the \u201cView\u201d tab and put a check next to \u201cGridlines.\u201d  [3] \n Photoshop: Open the View menu and select \u201cShow,\u201d then \u201cGrid.\u201d [4] \n Gimp: Open the View menu and select \u201cShow Grid.\u201d \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 5 \n Draw your icon.  Choose a tool like the pen, pencil or paintbrush (in any drawing software) to begin. Each software option has a color palette with plenty of colors to choose from. You can even add text to your new icon in any of the software options by selecting the text tool from the toolbar.\n Design experts recommend making icons simple, vibrant and easy to read. Remember that your icon will be much smaller when it\u2019s on your desktop, so try not to add too many tiny words or details.  [5] \n It\u2019s tough to draw a dynamic image with a mouse. For intensive drawing on a computer, you may want to try using a drawing tablet. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ac\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ac\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 6 \n Reduce the size of your icon.  First, save a copy of your icon at its current size so you can work on it again in the future. Open the file menu, click \u201cSave as,\u201d and choose a location for your file. Make sure you save it as a .bmp file. Now, to reduce the size on each of the three software options:\n Paint: On the Home tab, click \u201cResize\u201d and click the radio button next to Pixels. Set the icon size to 32 x 32 by typing  32  into both the Height and Width boxes. Click \u201cOK.\u201d \n Photoshop and Gimp: Open the Image menu and click \u201cImage Size\u201d (or \u201cScale Image\u201d in Gimp). Make sure \u201cPixels\u201d(\u201cpx\u201d in The Gimp) is selected in both the Height and Width dropdowns and type  32  into both boxes. Click \u201cOK.\u201d \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/78\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-7.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-7.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/78\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-7.jpg\\/v4-759px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-7.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":350.05494505495,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":578.35164835165} \n 7 \n Save your icon as an .ico file.  Now that you\u2019ve finished drawing, you\u2019re ready to save. Make sure to save to a location you\u2019ll remember.\n Paint: Open the File menu and click \u201cSave As.\u201d Before typing a file name, click the dropdown menu next to \u201cSave as Type\u201d and choose \u201c256-color bitmap.\u201d Next, select a folder where you\u2019d like to save your new icon. Now, type in the name of your icon next to \u201cfile name,\u201d giving it the file extension  .ico . For example, you could call it  mozillaalternate.ico . \n Photoshop: Open the File menu and choose \u201cSave as.\u201d Select \u201cWindows Icon File (.ico)\u201d from the list of save options. If you don\u2019t see it listed, make sure you installed the Telegraphics plugin.  [6] \n Gimp: Open the File menu and select \u201cSave As.\u201d Select the \u201cMicrosoft Windows Icon (.ico)\u201d file type. Now navigate to the location where you\u2019d like to save your icon, and then type a name for it in the \u201cfile name\u201d box. For example, you could call it  mozillaalternate.ico . \n Advertisement \n Method Two of Four: Converting an Image to a .ico File with Converticon Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8d\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-8.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-8.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8d\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-8.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-8.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Open Converticon in a web browser.  Converticon is a safe, easy-to-use web application that will convert any image to an .ico file (a Windows icon file). The address is www.converticon.com.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/15\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-9.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-9.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/15\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-9.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-9.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 2 \n Choose an image.  You can use any image type (such as .bmp, .jpeg, .png, and .tif) to begin. Choose something that stands out.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/46\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-10.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-10.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/46\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-10.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-10.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n Upload image.  Click \u201cGet Started\u201d to bring up a list of all folders on the computer. Navigate to the folder which contains your image, select it, then hit \u201cOpen.\u201d You\u2019ll see a small version of your image in the dialog box. Because your icon needs to be a perfect square, Converticon may adjust your image to make that possible.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cf\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-11.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-11.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cf\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-11.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-11.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":346.8956043956,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":573.13186813187} \n 4 \n Export your image.  Click \u201cExport\u201d to open a list of size options for your icon. First, click on \u201cIcon\u201d at the top of the screen. Next, choose a size for your icon. All available sizes are perfect squares. It\u2019s a good idea to choose the largest size (such as \u201coriginal size\u201d) so your icon is of the highest quality. Windows will scale the icon to a smaller size on your desktop so there\u2019s no need to save a tiny version of a .ico file.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b0\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-12.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-12.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b0\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-12.jpg\\/v4-759px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-12.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":348.15934065934,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":575.21978021978} \n 5 \n Save your icon.  Click \u201cSave As\u201d to open the list of folders on your computer.

Decide on an image (any image type, as long as its supported by the program you use) to convert into an icon. Remember, icons are actually small squares, so try to pick something that will look good in a small square box. Click \u201cFile\u201d then \u201cOpen\u201d in any image editing software and select the image you want to work with.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a5\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-16.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-16.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a5\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-16.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-16.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Change the size of the image.  In order to display correctly, you\u2019ll want your image to be a perfect square. We\u2019ll also need to shrink it to a size that will work as an icon file (we\u2019ll do 32 x 32).\n Crop: If you opened a large image that\u2019s rectangular, try using your editing software\u2019s cropping tool to identify a square area for your icon. Crop is on the Home tab of Pant, and in the Image menu on Photoshop and Gimp. \n Resize the image: In Paint, go to the Home tag and select \u201cResize,\u201d uncheck \u201cMaintain aspect ratio\u201d and type  32  into both the \u201cHorizontal\u201d and \u201cVertical\u201d boxes. In Photoshop and Gimp, open the Image menu and select \u201cImage Size\u201d in Photoshop, \u201cImage Scaling\u201d in Gimp. Take the check out of \u201cConstrain proportions\u201d and set both \u201cWidth\u201d and \u201cHeight\u201d to  32 . Note: this may warp the image. If so, try cropping it to a more square shape first. The end result will need to be a 32 x 32 pixel image, so you may need to switch back and forth between cropping and adjusting image size a few different times. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/33\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-17.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-17.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/33\\/Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-17.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-a-Windows-Icon-Step-17.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":348.15934065934,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":575.21978021978} \n 5 \n Save your icon as an .ico file.  Now that you\u2019ve editing, you\u2019re ready to save. Make sure to save to a location you\u2019ll remember.\n Paint: Open the File menu and click \u201cSave As.\u201d Before typing a file name, click the dropdown menu next to \u201cSave as Type\u201d and choose \u201c256-color bitmap.\u201d Next, select a folder where you\u2019d like to save your new icon. Now, type in the name of your icon next to \u201cfile name,\u201d giving it the file extension  .ico . For example,  mozillaalternate.ico . \n Photoshop: Open the File menu and choose \u201cSave as.\u201d Select \u201cWindows Icon File (.ico)\u201d from the list of save options. If you don\u2019t see it listed, make sure you installed the Telegraphics plugin. \n Gimp: Open the File menu and select \u201cSave As.\u201d Select the \u201cMicrosoft Windows Icon (.ico)\u201d file type. Now navigate to the location where you\u2019d like to save your icon, and then type a name for it in the \u201cfile name\u201d box.
