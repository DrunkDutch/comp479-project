[1]  However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of  Designing for the Disabled  (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the  dropped curb  \u2013 now a standard feature of the built environment. \n Universal design emerged from slightly earlier  barrier-free  concepts, the broader  accessibility movement , and  adaptive  and  assistive technology  and also seeks to blend  aesthetics  into these core considerations. As  life expectancy  rises and  modern medicine  increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments. \n Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  Color-contrast  dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another. There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's  public transit  systems, low-floor  buses  that \"kneel\" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with  ramps  rather than on-board lifts. \n Contents \n 1   Principles \n 2   Goals of Universal Design \n 3   Examples \n 4   Design standards \n 5   Design for All (DfA) \n 5.1   Background \n 5.2   Examples \n 5.3   In information and communication technology (ICT) \n 5.4   European DfA organizational networks \n 6   The \"Barrier-Free\" concept \n 7   National legislation \n 8   Regional legislation \n 9   Funding agencies \n 10   References \n 11   External links \n Principles [ edit ] \n The Center for Universal Design at  North Carolina State University  expounds the following principles: [2] \n Equitable  use \n Flexibility  in use \n Simple  and  intuitive \n Perceptible  information \n Tolerance for error \n Low physical effort \n Size and space for approach and use \n Each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines [3]  that can be applied to design processes in any realm: physical or digital. \n These principles are broader than those of  accessible design  and barrier-free design. \n Goals of Universal Design [ edit ] \n In 2012, The Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at  The University at Buffalo  expanded definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness. Rooted in evidence based design, the 8 goals of universal design were also developed [4] . \n Body Fit \n Comfort \n Awareness \n Understanding \n Wellness \n Social Integration \n Personalization \n Cultural Appropriateness \n The first four goals are oriented to human performance:  anthropometry ,  biomechanics ,  perception ,  cognition . Wellness bridges human performance and social participation. The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes. The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook \"Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments.\"  [5] \n Examples [ edit ] \n Smooth, ground level entrances without stairs \n Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level, less than 5 pounds force per 120 pounds rolling force \n Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant per ASTM 2047 \n Wide interior doors (3'0\"), hallways, and alcoves with 60\" \u00d7 60\" turning space at doors and dead-ends \n Functional clearances for approach and use of elements and components \n Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs \n Single-hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations \n Components that do not require tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist \n Components that require less than 5 pounds of force to operate \n Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches \n Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch \n Bright and appropriate lighting, particularly task lighting \n Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays \n Visual output redundant with information in auditory output \n Contrast controls on visual output \n Use of meaningful icons with text labels \n Clear lines of sight to reduce dependence on sound \n Volume controls on auditory output \n Speed controls on auditory output \n Choice of language on speech output \n Ramp access in swimming pools \n Closed  captioning  on television networks \n Signs with light-on-dark visual contrast \n Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images \n Instruction that presents material both orally and visually \n Labels on equipment control buttons that is large print \n A museum that allows visitors to choose to listen to or read descriptions \n Design standards [ edit ] \n In 1960, specifications for barrier free design were published. It was a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research. In 1961, the specifications became the first Barrier Free Design standard called the American National Standard, A1171.1 was published. It was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals. The research started in 1949 at the  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  and continues to this day. The principal investigator is Dr. Timothy Nugent (his name is listed in the front of the 1961, 1971, 1980 standard). In 1949 Dr. Nugent also started the  National Wheelchair Basketball Association . This ANSI A117.1 standard was adopted by the US federal government General Services Administration under 35 FR 4814 - 3/20/70, 39 FR 23214 - 6/27/74, 43 FR 16478 ABA- 4/19/78, 44 FR 39393 7/6/79, 46 FR 39436 8/3/81, in 1984 for UFAS and then in 1990 for ADA. The archived research documents are at the International Code Council (ICC) - ANSI A117.1 division. Dr. Nugent made presentations around the globe in the late 50's and 60's presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design. \n Another comprehensive publication by the  Royal Institute of British Architects  published three editions 1963, 1967, 1976 and 1997 of Designing for the Disabled by Selwyn Goldsmith UK. These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities. Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder. \n Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers, engineers, non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities. \n In October 2003, representatives from  China ,  Japan , and  South Korea  met in  Beijing  and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the  2008 Summer Olympics . \n The  International Organization for Standardization , the  European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization , and the  International Electrotechnical Commission  have developed: \n CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 . Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities (Identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71, but free for download) \n ISO 20282-1:2006  [6]  \u2013 Ease of operation of everyday products \u2014 Part 1: Context of use and user characteristics \n ISO/TS 20282-2:2013  [7]  - Usability of consumer products and products for public use\u2014Part 2: Summative test method, published 1 August 2013. \n Design for All (DfA) [ edit ] \n The term  Design for All  (DfA) is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation. \"Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality\" (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the  European Commission , it \"encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the  elderly  and people with  disabilities , as much as the teenage techno wizard.\" [8]  The origin of Design for All [9]  lies in the field of barrier free  accessibility  for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design. \n Background [ edit ] \n Design for All has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in Europe. [8]  Design for All is about ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances. \n Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition. It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market. Easy-to-use, accessible, affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens. Design for All permits access to the built environment, access to services and user-friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons. Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market. This is best achieved by identifying and involving users (\"stakeholders\") in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design (for All) in a wide range of socio-economic situations. \n Examples [ edit ] \n The following examples of Designs for All were presented in the book  Dise\u00f1os para todos/Designs for All  published in 2008 by Optimastudio with the support of Spain's Ministry of Education, Social Affairs and Sports (IMSERSO) and CEAPAT: [10] \n Audiobook \n Automatic door \n Electric Toothbrush \n Flexible drinking straw \n Google \n Low-floor bus \n Q-Drums [11] \n Tactile paving \n Trolley case  (roll along suitcase) \n Velcro \n Other useful items for those with mobility limitations: \n Washlet \n Wireless remote controlled power sockets \n Wireless remote controlled window shades \n In information and communication technology (ICT) [ edit ] \n Main article:  Design for All (in ICT) \n Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the  Information society . The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility. A three-way approach is proposed: goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or, failing that, products being easy to adapt according to different needs, or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology. To this end, manufacturers and service providers, especially, but not exclusively, in the  Information and Communication Technologies  (ICT), produce new technologies, products, services and applications for everyone. [8] \n European DfA organizational networks [ edit ] \n In Europe, people have joined in  networks  to promote and develop Design for All: \n The European Design for All eAccessibility Network (EDeAN) [12]  was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in 2002. It fosters Design for All for eInclusion, that is, creating an information society for all. It has national contact centres (NCCs) in almost all EU countries and more than 160 network members in national networks. \n EIDD - Design for All Europe is a  NGO  and a 100% self-financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD), to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2016) has 31 member organizations in 20 European countries. [13] \n EuCAN - The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in 1984 as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach. [14]  The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work. In 1999 the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre (better known by its acronym \u201cInfo-Handicap\u201d) took over the coordination of the steering group, together with the implicit responsibility for the follow-up of the  European Concept for Accessibility  (ECA). The EuCAN publications - like ECA - aim to provide practical guidance. They are neither academic nor policy documents. \n The \"Barrier-Free\" concept [ edit ] \n Barrier-free  ( \u30d0\u30ea\u30a2\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc ,   bariafurii )  building modification consists of modifying  buildings  or facilities so that they can be used by people who are  disabled  or have physical impairments. The term is used primarily in Japan and non-English speaking countries (e.g. German: Barrierefreiheit; Finnish: Esteett\u00f6myys), while in English-speaking countries, terms such as \"accessibility\" and \"handicapped accessible\" dominate in regular everyday use. An example of barrier-free design would be installing a  ramp  for  wheelchairs  alongside or in place of steps. In the case of new buildings, however, the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design, which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access. \n Freeing a building of barriers means: \n Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people \n Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairments \n Reviewing everything - from structure to smallest detail \n Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes \n Barrier free is also a term that applies to handicap accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  Guidelines don't make specifications. \n An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier-free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore. Within five years, all public housing estates in the country, all of 7,800 blocks of apartments, have benefited from the program.
