We therefore are extending the comment period from August 26,  2016 to September 30, 2016. \n The CSA also plans to hold roundtables with market  participants in fall 2016, to discuss issues raised in comment letters. \n Questions \n If you have any comments or  questions, please contact any of the CSA staff listed below. \n Jason    Alcorn \n            Senior    Legal Counsel \n            Financial    and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick \n            Tel:    506-643-7857 \n jason.alcorn@fcnb.ca \n Jane    Anderson \n            Director,    Policy & Market Regulation and Secretary to the Commission \n            Nova    Scotia Securities Commission  \n            Tel:    902-424-0179 \n jane.anderson@novascotia.ca \n Chris    Besko \n            Director,    General Counsel \n            The    Manitoba Securities Commission \n            Tel:    204-945-2561 \n            Toll    Free (Manitoba only): 1-800-655-5244 \n chris.besko@gov.mb.ca \n Sarah    Corrigall-Brown \n            Senior    Legal Counsel, Capital Markets Regulation \n            British    Columbia Securities Commission \n            Tel:    604-899-6738 \n scorrigall-brown@bcsc.bc.ca \n Debra    Foubert  \n            Director \n            Compliance    and Registrant Regulation  \n            Ontario    Securities Commission \n            Tel:    416-593-8101 \n            dfoubert@osc.gov.on.ca   \n No\u00e9mie C.
