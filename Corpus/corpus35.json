We will evaluate your choices in the order you specify. \n Your first choice should be your top choice . If you don\u2019t get accepted to your first choice, we\u2019ll automatically consider your other choices, in the order that you specify. \n Pick a new subject for each choice . For example, don't choose the honours, specialization and major in the same subject (e.g. Psychology) for your three choices. If you don't meet the requirements for the honours, we'll automatically consider you for the specialization or the major instead. \n Admission requirements for some programs are exactly the same  (for example, all John Molson School of Business degree programs and Aerospace Engineering programs). Do not choose more than one program for your three choices if they have the same admission requirements. \n Consider including a less competitive program among your choices . This will help maximize your chances! \n Are you ready? \n APPLY NOW \n Already applied? \n FIND OUT WHAT'S NEXT \n \u00a0 \n Official application deadlines \n We consider complete applications year round and we give priority to applicants who apply by official deadlines.
