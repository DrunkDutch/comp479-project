A co-organizer of C.L.I.T Fest New Brunswick, she is interested in making people of color (POC) more visible in the punk and DIY scenes. Her zine will be about how a string of disappointing romantic situations have convinced her to be non-sexual with anyone until January of 2013. Although these disappointments were the catalyst, it will also deal with issues of consent, boundaries, mental health, family history, failed polyamory, and both internalized misogyny and white suprematism. Overall, what it means to be a sex-positive feminist while figuring out how to unlearn your oppressive and unhealthy habits. An avid reader of zines, this will be her first zine coming to fruition and not just floundering in Google Docs. \n   Read more \u00bb \n Comments   \n\t\t\t\t\tTags: \t\t\t\t \n ZINE LAUNCH AND PERFORMANCE TONIGHT \u2014 Unicorn Heroes on the Wrong Side of the Tracks \n Categories:  Distro ,  News & Upcoming Events Posted on September 22, 2012  \n Come party with us to launch our new zine, Unicorn Heroes on the Wrong Side of the Tracks, celebrating our supernatural, glamourous and monstrous heroes.
