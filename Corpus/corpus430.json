The  Keyline  refers to a specific  topographic feature  linked to water flow. Beyond that however, Keyline can be seen as a collection of design principles, techniques and systems for development of rural and urban landscapes. \n Keyline design was developed in Australia by farmer and engineer  P. A. Yeomans , and described and explained in his books  The Keyline Plan ,  The Challenge of Landscape ,  Water For Every Farm , and  The City Forest . \n Contents \n 1   Application \n 2   Keyline Scale of Permanence \n 3   Keypoint \n 4   Applications \n 5   See also \n 6   References \n 6.1   Notations \n 6.2   Footnotes \n 7   External links \n Application [ edit ] \n P. A. Yeomans  published the first book on Keyline in 1954. Yeomans described a system of amplified contour ripping to control rainfall runoff and enable fast flood irrigation of undulating land without the need for  terracing . \n Keyline designs include irrigation dams equipped with through-the-wall  lockpipe  systems to  gravity feed  irrigation, stock water, and yard water. Graded earth channels may be interlinked to broaden the catchment areas of high dams, conserve the height of water, and transfer rainfall runoff into the most efficient high dam sites. Roads follow both ridge lines and water channels to provide easier movement across the land. [1] \n Keyline Scale of Permanence [ edit ] \n The backbone of Yeomans' keyline design system, the outcome of fifteen years of adaptive experimentation, is Yeomans' Keyline Scale of Permanence (KSOP), which identifies typical farms' elements ordered according to their degree of permanence: \n Climate \n Landshape \n Water Supply \n Roads/Access \n Trees \n Structures \n Subdivision Fences \n Soil \n Keyline considers these elements when planning the placement of water storage, roads, trees, buildings and fences. On undulating land, a keyline approach involves identifying several features namely  ridges  and  valleys  and the natural water courses seeking optimum water storage sites and potential interconnecting channels. \n The water lines identified from the land-form subsequently provide optimal locations for the various less permanent elements (roads, fences, trees, and buildings) to optimize the natural potential of the landscape. \nRancho San Ricardo, M\u00e9xico \n Keypoint [ edit ] \n In a smooth grassy valley, a location called the  keypoint  can be found where the lower and flatter portion of a primary valley floor suddenly steepens. The  keyline  of this primary valley is revealed by pegging a contour line through the keypoint, within the valley shape. All the points on the line are at the same elevation as the keypoint. Contour plowing parallel to the Keyline, both above and below will automatically become \"off-contour\" but the developing pattern will tend to drift rainwater runoff away from the valley centre and incidentally, prevent erosion. \n Keyline pattern cultivation on ridge shapes is done parallel to any suitable contour but only working on the upper side of the contour guide line. This automatically develops a pattern of off-contour cultivation in which all the rip marks left in the soil will slope down towards the centre of the ridge shape. This pattern of cultivation allows more time for water to soak in. Keyline pattern cultivation also enables controlled flood irrigation of undulating land, which further assists in the fast development of deep biologically fertile soil, which results in improving soil nutrition and health. \n In many countries, including Australia, it is important to get optimum absorption of rainfall and keyline cultivation does this as well as delaying the potentially damaging concentration of runoff. Yeomans' technique differs from traditional contour plowing in several important respects. Random  contour plowing  also becomes off contour but usually with the opposite effect on runoff water causing it to quickly shed off ridge shapes and be concentrated in valleys. The limitations of the traditional system of  soil conservation , with its \"safe disposal\" approach to  farm water  was an important motivational factor in the development of the keyline system. \n Applications [ edit ] \n David Holmgren , one of the founders of  Permaculture , used Yeoman's keyline principle extensively in the formulation of Permaculture concepts and the design of sustainable human settlements and  organic farms . \n Darren J. Doherty has extensive experience across the world in keyline project design, development, management & training, and is using Keyline as the basis for his Regrarians framework, which he considers an update and synthesis of Permaculture, Holistic Management, Keyline Design and several other innovative human ecology frameworks into a coherent process-based toolkit for the design and management of regenerative economies. \n A  topographical  example can be seen on ( 37\u00b009\u203233\u2033S   144\u00b015\u203208\u2033E \ufeff / \ufeff 37.159154\u00b0S 144.252248\u00b0E \ufeff /  -37.159154; 144.252248 [2] ). \n Keyline also includes concepts for rapid soil fertility enhancement and these concepts are explored in  Priority One  by P. A. Yeomans' son Allan. Yeomans and his sons were also instrumental in the design and production of special plows and cultivating equipment for use in conjunction with the keyline methodology. \n See also [ edit ] \n Environment portal \n Ecology portal \n Earth_sciences portal \n Biology portal \n Sustainable Development portal \n Conservation biology \n Conservation ethic \n Conservation movement \n Ecology \n Environmentalism \n Environmental protection \n Habitat conservation \n Natural environment \n Natural capital \n Natural resource \n Renewable resource \n Sustainable agriculture \n Sustainability \n Water conservation \n Soil salination \n References [ edit ] \n Notations [ edit ] \n Yeomans, P.A.
