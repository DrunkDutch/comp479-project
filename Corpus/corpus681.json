Aside from English, her ancestry includes Romanian (from a maternal great-grandmother) and German. [4] [5] \n Ehle appeared as a toddler in a 1973 Broadway revival of  A Streetcar Named Desire , in which her mother played Blanche DuBois. [6]  She spent her childhood in both the UK and the US, attending several different schools, including  Interlochen Arts Academy . She was raised largely in  Asheville, North Carolina . Her drama training was split between the  North Carolina School of the Arts [7]  and the  Central School of Speech and Drama  in London. [8] \n Career [ edit ] \n Ehle made her West End debut as Orgon's wife in the 1991  Peter Hall Company  production of  Tartuffe , for which she won second prize at the  Ian Charleson Awards . [9] [10]  Hall then cast her as Calypso in a 1992 television adaptation of  Mary Wesley 's novel  The Camomile Lawn , in which she and her mother played the same character at different ages. [11]  This story, produced by UK's  Channel 4 , was a five-part  miniseries  about the lives and loves of a family of cousins from 1939 to the present. The two would later reprise this different age portrayal of a character as Valerie in  Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 's 1999 movie  Sunshine . \n Her performance as  Elizabeth Bennet  in the  BBC   1995 television adaptation  of  Jane Austen 's classic  Pride and Prejudice  earned her a  British Academy of Film and Television Arts  (BAFTA) award. After a stint with the  Royal Shakespeare Company , [12]  she gained her first major feature film role in  Paradise Road . She continued her career on both stage and screen. In 2000, she received further critical acclaim for her Broadway debut as Annie in  Tom Stoppard 's  The Real Thing , winning both a  Theatre World Award  and the  Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play . Her mother was also nominated for the same award that year for  Waiting in the Wings . [13]  After a hiatus, Ehle returned to the stage in 2005 in  The Philadelphia Story  at the  Old Vic  opposite  Kevin Spacey . The following year, she played Lady Macbeth in  Macbeth  as part of the Shakespeare in the Park, and won her second Tony award for portraying three characters in Stoppard's  The Coast of Utopia  triptych, which ran from October 2006 until May 2007. [14] \n Her more recent film work includes  Before the Rains , an Indian-U.S. co-production directed by  Santosh Sivan , and  Pride and Glory  with  Edward Norton  and  Colin Farrell . In 2008, she was featured in the CBS telefilm  The Russell Girl . \n In August 2009, it was announced that Ehle would play the character of  Catelyn Stark  in the pilot of  HBO 's  Game of Thrones , an adaptation of  George R.R. Martin 's  A Song of Ice and Fire  fantasy book series. Ehle filmed the pilot episode, but decided it was too soon to return to work after the birth of her daughter. She was replaced by Northern Irish actress  Michelle Fairley . [15] [16] \n In 2010, Ehle starred alongside  John Lithgow  in the production of  Mr. & Mrs. Fitch  presented by  Second Stage Theatre . [17]  She played Myrtle Logue, wife of  King George VI 's speech therapist  Lionel Logue , in  The King's Speech . George was played by her  Pride and Prejudice  costar  Colin Firth . \n In 2011, Ehle played Dr. Ally Hextall in  Steven Soderbergh 's critically acclaimed  Contagion . In the autumn of 2011, Ehle began a costarring role in the American television series  A Gifted Man .
