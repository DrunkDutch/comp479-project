It can fly at Mach 1.6 and carry 15,000lb of weapons 900 nautical miles  \n Forward island bridge: \u00a0The Queen Elizabeth is unusual in having two \"islands\" on the flight deck - the forward one from which the ship is commanded and the aft one which controls aircraft movements. Having two islands means airflow over the flight deck is more stable, making flight operations safer. The aft island is also better positioned to command aircraft landings  \n Long-range radar: Claimed to be able to automatically detect and track up to 1,000 air targets at a range of around 250 nautical miles  \n Aircraft lifts: The Queen Elizabeth class has two of these lifts to move aircraft between the hangar and flight deck.\u00a0 Each one can move two F35s from the hangar to the flight deck in 60 seconds\u00a0  \n AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin: Medium-lift helicopter designed to replace ageing Sea King, this three-engine aircraft can carry a crew of three and 26 troops up to 450 nautical miles. It also conducts anti-submarine warfare and is due to take on airborne early warning duties using the new Crowsnest radar\u00a0  \n Medium-range radar: Artisan radar able to beat the most complex jammers and said to be able to track a target the size of a snooker ball 12 miles away  \n Small calibre gun: The\u00a0carriers\u00a0are designed to receive the latest generation of the Phalanx close-in weapon system to defend against aircraft and missiles, firing 3,000 20mm shells a minute. Each ship will also have 30mm guns and mini-guns to tackle threats such as small boats\u00a0  \n Aircraft hangar: The hangar can accommodate any helicopter in the British military arsenal, including the twin-rotor Chinook  \n Commanding officer's suite: When not on the bridge, the ship's commader works out of this group of cabins. The Queen Elizabeth's first seagoing captain has been named as Commodore Jerry Kyd, the former Captain of HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious\u00a0  \n Bulbous bow: Protrudes just below the waterline and alters the water's flow around the hull, which reduces drag and improves efficiency, as well as improving buoyancy at the front of the ship  \n Forward engine room: The ship is powered by two Rolls-Royce Marine Trent MT30 48,000 horsepower gas turbine generator units, the largest ever supplied to the Royal Navy. They can drive the ship along at more than 25 knots and it carries enough fuel to sail 10,000 nautical miles  \n Propeller:\u00a0Each of the ship\u2019s two propellers weighs 33 tonnes - nearly two and half times as much\u00a0as a double-decker bus\u00a0 \n C overing an area the size of 10 football pitches, the depot will be capable of holding 15,000 pallets of medical, mail and naval stores, as well as accommodating the sailors and civilians who will look after the ships. \n Britain's vast new aircraft carriers will make enemies 'think twice' about starting war  \n C ommodore Jeremy Rigby, naval base commander, said: \u201cThe work on the Queen Elizabeth Class centre is a tangible milestone in getting the base ready to support our new aircraft carriers. A huge amount of activity is in train ashore and in the harbour to make sure we are ready to receive HMS Queen Elizabeth. \n \u201cThese are exciting times for the base and the wider Portsmouth area as we prepare for these huge ships which have secured the future of the base for the rest of the century. \n \u201cBAE is working in partnership with the Royal Navy to improve the Queen Elizabeth class ships\u2019 company experience that the carrier\u2019s crew will receive at the waterfront and provide the resources, information, material and facilities they will need in Portsmouth and on operations around the world.\u201d \n T he creation of a dedicated area for the carriers forms part of the overall update of Portsmouth Naval Base \u2013 with four areas to support different types of vessels. The first of these was opened in 2015 as the Centre of Specialisation for Frigates and Destroyers, while work began on minehunter HMS Brocklesby in the new Small Ships Centre of Specialisation in early May. \n \u00a0 \n Comment icon \n Follow Telegraph Business \nFollow on Facebook\nFollow on Twitter\nFollow on Instagram\n READ MORE ABOUT: \n Royal Navy \n BAE Systems \n Defence industry \n HMS Queen Elizabeth \n Portsmouth \n Ministry of Defence \n Show more \n Show comments \nIf you would like to add a comment, please register or log in\n Register \n Log in \n Please review our  commenting policy \n Follow Telegraph Business \nFollow on Facebook\nFollow on Twitter\nFollow on Instagram\n Galleries\n Gallery \n 09 Nov 2017 , \n 1:45pm \n Gallery:  Equal Pay Day: 10 ways to visualise the gender pay gap \n Gallery \n 03 Nov 2017 , \n 7:00am \n Gallery:  The most expensive and extravagant advent calendars to buy this Christmas \n Gallery \n 02 Nov 2017 , \n 9:29am \n Gallery:  'I'm truly the reflection of perfection': the 16 daftest Apprentice candidates of all time \n Business latest\n 25 Nov 2017 , \n 9:43pm \n 'No EU-UK deal?
