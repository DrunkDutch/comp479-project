If the council of a regional county municipality decides to use moneys from the general fund to pay a capital expenditure incurred for the benefit of only some of the local municipalities whose territory is situated in the territory of the regional county municipality, it may decide to reimburse the fund by means of an aliquot share payable by the local municipalities concerned. In such a case, the council shall authorize the use of the moneys by a by-law that specifies the amount of the moneys used and contains a detailed description of the expenditure. The by-law must also specify the term of repayment, which is not to exceed the useful life of the property that the moneys enable the regional county municipality to acquire, repair, restore or build, and must require an aliquot share from the local municipalities for whose benefit the expenditure is incurred. \n 2008, c. 18, s. 48 . \n Contact us \n Site map \n Quebec portal \n Accessibility \n Privacy policy \n \u00a9 Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec \n \u00d7 \n Selections \n Show \n Selections in current document \n All selections in the collection \n Selected elements \n Delete all selections \n Show selections \n Close \n \u00d7 \n Cyberlex \n\t\t\t\t\t\tVersion 1.0.19.0"}
