School facilities include a common room, a student lounge, a seminar room, a student research room as well as faculty and staff offices. \n The building is situated on the east side of Mackay Street, between Sherbrooke Street West and de Maisonneuve Boulevard West. It is steps away from the Hall Building, the main Webster Library Building, and downtown Montreal life with its lively caf\u00e9s and bookstores. As an older building, the School is not wheelchair accessible. \n &amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; \n View larger map \n Contact us \n Vicky Pearson, Assistant to the Principal \n victoria.pearson@concordia.ca \n 514-848-2424 ext. 2575 \n Perry Calce, Coordinator, Academic Programs and Curriculum Development \n perry.calce@concordia.ca \n 514-848-2424 ext. 2579 \n 514-848-2577 \n Location \n 2149 MacKay \n CI Building \nMontreal, Quebec, Canada \nH3G 2J2 \n Join the conversation \n School of Community and Public Affairs Alumni\r\n Community Economic Development\r\n Mailing address \n School of Community and Public Affairs \nConcordia University (S-CI Building) \n1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \nMontreal, Quebec, Canada \nH3G 1M8 \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About the department \n Programs \n Student life \n News & events \n Contact us \n School of Community and Public Affairs \n Sir George William Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map \n 2149 Mackay Street \n CI Building \n See building map \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
