It is available for free under the  GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 . If you are interested in receiving a free copy of our software and all of its extensions, see below for the download link. \n In addition, the idea for wikiHow was inspired by  Wikipedia , a free-content encyclopedia built on the same wiki software platform. Wikipedia is a free resource that benefits the whole world. We feel indebted to the Wikipedians for inspiring us and showing us how magnificent a wiki can be. We hope that wikiHow can provide accurate and clear \"How To\" instructions, much as Wikipedia provides free encyclopedic information. \n Welcome Wikipedians! \n Welcome to wikiHow! If you are a Wikipedian, you will feel, more or less, at home at wikiHow. As you spend more time here, you will probably notice some things that this community does differently, but while you are learning the wikiHow way you should feel free to  be bold  in your editing. Eventually you will feel comfortable in both communities. \n As you are editing a page on wikiHow, you can press  Advanced Editing  in the upper left on the editing screen to get the familiar Wikipedia style page editing. \n Here are some links that will be helpful in getting integrated with the wikiHow community: \n Contribute to wikiHow  - Some basic instructions on contributing here. \n Community Portal \n The forums  - Similar to the Village Pump. \n The wikiHow Tour  - A guided presentation on how wikiHow works. \n MediaWiki Extensions \n wikiHow runs a somewhat modified version of MediaWiki. Many of the changes made to the software by us are freely available as extensions. It is our goal to both create extensions that help wikiHow users along in their quest to make wikiHow the best how-to manual in the world and to give these modifications back to the open source community. While not all of our features have been extracted into readily usable extensions, we aim to eventually release all of them through MediaWiki extensions or some sort of documentation. Because some features are interdependent, it is difficult to release them as individually. \n A complete list of our extensions is available at  wikiHow's version page . \n Receiving our Source Code \n wikiHow offers the  Right to Fork . We thus provide free copies of our source code. You can download it by  clicking here. \n Please note that while we will happily give you all our source code, we are unable to provide any support for this software. With a very small engineering team, we simply don't have the resources to help anyone else install and use this software. We are sorry about this. Our MediaWiki installation is a constantly changing mix of undocumented hacks and we do not recommend any other project adopt this code lock, stock and barrel. Instead, we recommend using the standard stable and supported versions of MediaWiki which can be downloaded from  MediaWiki.org . \n Article Info \n  Categories:  About wikiHow \n In other languages: \n Deutsch:\u00a0 wikiHow:Betrieben mit und inspiriert durch Mediawiki   \n Discuss \n Print \n Email \n Edit \n Thanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 228,816 times. \n Did this article help you? \n Yes \n No \n \u00a0 \n Cookies make wikiHow better.
