They came brand new and played perfectly. :) For those interested in buying them without prior knowledge on the movie, keep in mind that this is NOT a film based COMPLETELY on facts. There are details added and taken away to add suspense and drama to the original story of Joseph Smith restoring the church. :) Read more 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuse 5.0 out of 5 stars A good film for all By Daniel M on November 5, 2013 Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I was 58yrs old when I joined the church and I thank God I have an open mind toward the truth. If, and I am sure what he ( The Lord Jesus Christ ) said is true, by their fruits you shall know them, this is what I was searching for all my life. I have read and heard many negative comments about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life and since joining the church and I thank God I have an open mind and decided to look into it myself. The Church is the most Christ centered church I have ever attended and believe me, I attended them all. I pray with a sincere heart that if you are reading my post and are not already a member, it is not by chance but The Father of all truth led you here, have an open mind and pray with a sincere heart and ask God the Father to lead you into the path of his desire. Knock and it shall be opened unto you, seek and ye shall find, ask and it will be given to you. Oh, the movie or series of movies, there are 3 was excellent, it is about a family seeking the truth and it isn't centered on the Prophet Joseph Smith's.
