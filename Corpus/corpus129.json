This draft is\nmeant to indicate progress in accounting for resolved issues and editorial\nchanges. This document still requires lots of editing and validation, which\nwill take place most likely once the guidelines advance to proposed\nrecommendation. \n Editorial changes \n There have been a lot of editorial changes (too many to list exhaustively)\nbased on very helpful comments from many reviewers. Some more important\nchanges include: \n Use of \"content developer\" rather than author in most places. \n Document usability changes \n Added a \"checkpoint map\" (section 7) that lists all the checkpoints and\n    where they are discussed in the techniques document (by section name and\n    number). \n Removed links from techniques sections back to the guidelines since\n    confusing. Instead, the checkpoint map contains those links. This makes\n    reading the techiques easier. \n Longdescs added for images. \n Removed links from body of document to external sites. Instead, added a\n    new list of services (section 6) that has all these links. \n Technique changes \n Removed techniques and examples about brief descriptions. \n In \"Always make the source of a frame an HTML document\", some small\n    fixes to correct example.

Rows of a TFOOT element will appear before the BODY of\n    the document in an HTML3.2 browser. \n Commented out comment about HTML 4 suggesting that UA's can ignore\n    leading or trailing spaces (in discussion about null alt-text). \n Updated ASCII art section to reflect 4 Feb minutes \n Edited the examples for use of OBJECT and alt-text so that \"title\" is\n    not replacement for \"alt\" rather it is supplementary to providing\n  content. \n Edited examples for frames and longdesc. gave more copmlicated used of\n    frames where descriptions are needed for three frames. \n Added a badly worded paragraph about bypassing groups of links. \n Changed title to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \n Added the term \"content developers\" to prose \n Added statement about title change to status sections \n Version WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990115/wai-pageauth-tech \n Markup for examples has been cleaned up.

While the STYLE element is presentational, it may be used\n    to enhance the presentation of structural elements. The other presentation\n    elements are often used instead of structural elements.\" \n Two techniques pertaining to LABEL position were combined into one since\n    the technique presented an either/or situation. \n Several technical errors in the examples were corrected. \n Although there is still ongoing discussion, the NOFRAMES example was\n    changed so that the NOFRAME only appears in a FRAMESET not in BODY\n  alone. \n A list of techniques relating to alternative text was added at the end\n    of that section. \n Copyright \ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd 1997  W3C  ( MIT ,  INRIA ,  Keio  ), All Rights Reserved.
