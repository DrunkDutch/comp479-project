Rowling\u2019s mega-popular Harry Potter series to the big screen, it\u2019s practically a statistical anomaly that the final entry, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2,\u201d brings its A-game from start to finish.   <p>Britain's Emma Watson poses with Daniel Radcliffe (L) and Rupert Grint as they arrive for the world premiere of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1\" at Leicester Square in London November 11, 2010. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth</p>\n It\u2019s something akin to finding a herd of eight adorable, cotton-candy-pooping unicorns.   This far into the story, screenwriter Steve Kloves (who adapted all but one of Rowling\u2019s seven Potter novels) doesn\u2019t have to explain the stakes (Voldemort and his Death Eaters are poised to take over the magical world and destroy Muggle-kind) or the characters or the plot mechanics.   \u201cDeathly Hallows, Part 2\u201d even opens with long, silent shots of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and Snape (Alan Rickman) staring significantly out different windows, and after the introduction of so many characters and places and magical devices over the years, the actors and the audience alike have earned a bit of silence.   But there\u2019s little time for introspection.   Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) are still out to find and destroy the various horcruxes that contain pieces of Voldemort\u2019s soul, but thankfully, the endless, gloomy-teen campout sequences of \u201cDeathly Hallows, Part 1\u201d are behind us. Their quest takes them everywhere from the cavernous and deadly vaults at Gringott\u2019s bank to the halls of Hogwarts.   This once-cheery castle, perhaps the movies\u2019 ultimate British boarding school, has the somber feel of an occupied fort. The forces of darkness are in charge, and they\u2019ve cast a pall over everything, even the usually indefatigable Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith).   In other words, things have gotten way, way darker since \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d back in 2001. Major characters have been dying ever since Robert Pattinson got snuffed in \u201cGoblet of Fire,\u201d but the body count has never been as high as it is this time. Parents whose young children haven\u2019t already read the books and aren\u2019t prepared for what\u2019s coming might think twice about this one.   As if to give fans one last look at every corner of this world, Kloves\u2019 script calls back almost every element of the wizarding world we\u2019ve come to know: From Gringott\u2019s to Olivander\u2019s wand shop to the Honeydews candy store to the Room of Requirement, places that have played key roles in the plot all come up yet again. (Even the Sorting Hat from the first film makes another appearance.)   Similarly, there\u2019s a seemingly endless parade of movie stars (Smith, Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent) and Potter stars (particularly Matthew Lewis\u2019 Neville Longbottom) on display as well.   If there\u2019s one substantial flaw to the film, it\u2019s that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time. Looking forward to the emotional culmination of the courtship between Harry and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright)? Well, tough.   Characters in the movie are sacrificing themselves for the greater good, and characters are getting sacrificed from the script for more daily showtimes.   Trying to keep tabs on, say, the older Weasleys or the Hogwarts faculty is like trying to spot your favorite singer getting one line during an Aretha Franklin tribute at the Grammys.   As such, the actors here have to make the most of their fleeting moments, and they consistently do. What the post-Potter careers of Radcliffe, Watson and Grint will be like is anyone\u2019s guess, but at this point they know how to take these particular characters to the bridge without breaking a sweat. Alan Rickman gets to show us many sides of Snape, and he\u2019s as compelling as always, even when the flashbacks use some freaky age-erasing special effects that leave his face looking odd.   Bonham Carter\u2019s Bellatrix Lestrange is as goth-gorgon as ever, but she has some fun with some early scenes in which she gets to portray the Hermione-on-polyjuice-potion version of the character. And during the film\u2019s big climactic battle, Smith and Julie Walters get some tasty moments that make their relatively small roles over the course of the series worthwhile.   Thankfully, there\u2019s more to \u201cDeathly Hallows, Part 2\u201d than just the simple tying-up of loose ends. Even after everything he\u2019s endured in his years at Hogwart\u2018s, Harry continues to learn secrets about his past, including a heretofore-unrevealed backstory of a certain character that makes for an interesting twist.   If you have no affection for these British teen wizards, of course, this is not the movie that\u2019s going to make you change your mind. But if you\u2019ve been a devoted follower of the Potter saga in print and at the movies, you\u2019ll come away from this final chapter with a feeling of catharsis and, perhaps, a slightly damp handkerchief.
