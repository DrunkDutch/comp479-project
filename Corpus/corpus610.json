Another perspective of Labour's political position was included and then when rejected a citation was asked for the current statement of centre-left. The current information on the parties political position is based off historical values and there is insufficient evidence provided to claim The UK Labour party is currently and categorically (as of May 2015) centre-left and encompasses no other position on the political scale. If people wish to claim the party is of that position (and no other), recent credible evidence must be supplied, otherwise the position given is as much of an opinion as others that change its status to other positions which are just as credible e.g. centre-left to centre. \n Infobox stats [ edit ] \n League stats only in infobox.

You explained your edit: \"as [the SSP] is running under the organization of RISE for this election, its polling figures are not independent of RISE.\" This is not true. YouGov continue to prompt for \"Scottish Socialist Party\" in polling intention rather than \"RISE\". Therefore, it would be inaccurate to report the latest poll from YouGov as showing 1% for RISE. That is why I combined the columns and included the logo for both organisations. \n Zcbeaton  ( talk ) 18:08, 17 March 2016 (UTC) \n Disambiguation link notification for April 7 [ edit ] \n Hi.

All of the political parties which made up the TCSC alliance are explicitly Trotskyist ( Socialist Party ,  Socialist Party Scotland ,  Socialist Workers Party  and  Solidarity ). The TCSC have been described as far-left by The Times and the International Business Times, [1] [2]  so it seems reasonable to include them and categorise them under the Trotskyist section.  Cla\u00edomh Solais  ( talk ) 10:28, 16 December 2016 (UTC) \n References \n ^   Fisher, Lucy (7 August 2015).  \"Revealed: Labour's hard-left infiltrators\" .  The Times . Retrieved  25 March  2016 .  (Subscription required ( help )) . \u00a0 \n ^   Silvera, Ian (14 September 2015).  \"Far-left TUSC seeks anti-austerity electoral pact with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour\" .  International Business Times . Retrieved  25 March  2016 . \u00a0 \n Yes, but just because all the parties that make up TUSC identify Troksyism as one of their ideologies, does not mean the group itself has adopted the ideology. All the parties that make up TUSC have other ideologies besides Trotskyism. It doesn't mean they choose to promote or espouse that ideology, just because they have it in common. The group has also been described as left-wing by other media outlets, please read the introduction on the page.  Helper201  ( talk ) 10:35, 16 December 2016 (UTC) \n I think you're missing the point. We have mainstream media describing the TUSC as far-left, literally each and every one of it's constituent parties are explicitly Trotskyists. In our article on the TUSC it is mentioned with references that they are a far-left group, so they are evidently of interest to a template and article on the wider British far-left in general. The same cam be said of the  Respect Party . In our own article on the topic, it is mentioned that they are described as far-left by mainstream academia, in books published by the likes of Palgrave Macmillan. So they too are of interest to such an article/template. If you disagree with those descriptions themselves then it would make sense for you to attempt to get consensus to remove the description of far-left from those specific articles themselves.  Cla\u00edomh Solais  ( talk ) 10:50, 16 December 2016 (UTC) \n As I said,  please read the introduction  on the TUSC page. There are citations for left-wing too, one of which is BBC news (as seen in the introduction), of which you could not get more mainstream of media. I'm pretty sure I left the far-left tag on that article, because yes, it is seen that way but some, but also left-wing by others, the coalition itself sits somewhere between the two. However the other tags you've been making have been absolute nonsense and extremely aggravating, many of these parties, such as the Respect Party were or are either left-wing or in other cases there are simply no citations supporting they are far-left. If you look at the info box on the right hand side of the Respect Party's page it clearly says 'left-wing' with multiple supporting citations. \n Yes, there are citations presented from reliable sources for both left-wing and far-left. Being also described by some sources as left-wing doesn't cancel out sources describing them as far-left. These parties are to the left of the most left-wing part of mainstream British politics - ie, the left-wing of the Labour Party and the Green Party. While Respect probably only just make the grade as far-left, we have sources describing them as such and they openly stood as part of an electoral alliance with the SWP (which is Trotskyist) and in Europe were part of the  European Anti-Capitalist Left , which is predominantly Trotskyist. So they are part of the history of the British far-left movement, whichever way it is looked at.  Cla\u00edomh Solais  ( talk ) 11:13, 16 December 2016 (UTC) \n I know, hence why I left the tag on the TUSC page, because it had citations for far-left. TUSC is more to the left than Labour or the Green's, yes. However being left of these parties does not automatically make you far-left, that is nonsense. There can be a centre-left party that is more left than another centre-left party without being left-wing, same for left-wing without being far-left. You can be out of the main political parties and still be left-wing, which most definitely is different to being far-left. Before adding this tag it should be clear in the info box on the right hand side of the page that the party is at least partially far-left and be supported by citations. Don't just go mass placing it around on pages with no supporting citations. Just because a party is on the left and not mainstream, have anyone elected or in the media spotlight does not make it far-left. You're acting like anything to the left of Labour and not a main political party is somehow far-left. Also parties can be anti-capitalist and not be far-left. You can't automatically assume a certain ideology defines a party's whole political position. Look at  Syriza  for instance, they are anti-capitalist, yet as seen in the info box on the right hand side of the page (supported by citations), they are a left-wing party.  Helper201  ( talk ) 11:34, 16 December 2016 (UTC) \n Also, you shouldn't use citations that require a subscription. All citations should be freely and easily accessible.

Folf)  ( talk ) 19:00, 12 July 2017 (UTC) \n Hi. I did not seek to change what you did when you reverted my edit as I assumed the evidence I have would be regarded as unreliable. I removed the catagory off of personal experience having completed the game and having read through Wiki's but thought they would likely be regarded as unreliable. I did find one character to be under 18, but the main characters are well evidenced of being over 18 (Max being 18 and Chloe being 19). The story does mainly focus on these two characters and thus I would not regard it as coming-of-age.  Helper201  ( talk ) 19:06, 12 July 2017 (UTC) \n Actually it was  Lordtobi  that reverted you the second time. Just FYI, Wikipedia does not accept  original research . Please be prepared to cite a source for your edits where applicable.  jd22292   (Jalen D. Folf)  ( talk ) 17:19, 13 July 2017 (UTC) \n I know, I've been on Wikipedia quite a while. It was only a removal of a catagory, of which a claim (such as a catagory claim) should have evidence to be there in the first place, I couldn't see any. Removal of uncited content is by no means breaking any rules.  Helper201  ( talk ) 00:06, 14 July 2017 (UTC) \n Pirate Party UK [ edit ] \n Hello. The accounts submitted to the EC actually have this membership figure on them. There used to be a citation on the page showing this but it has since been removed - apparently the citation isn't open to the general public yet, but it should be shortly (it's actually over-due but the snap general election has slowed down the electoral commission some what). It's a bit of a waste of time to edit the graph only to change it back in a week or two - especially when I know the information to be valid. \n Party for Socialism and Liberation [ edit ] \n Here is a direct quote from the party's  official program : \n Achieving fully developed socialism, a goal that has not yet been achieved anywhere, will open the way to communism and the end of class society. Communism will also mean the \u201cwithering away\u201d of the repressive state, which only came into being with the rise of class society. \n This political party is Leninist, supports the Cuban Communist Party, is sympathetic historically with the former Soviet Union, and is an offshoot from the Worker's World Party, long known as a communist party. It has never repudiated communism. \n This justifies categorizing it as a communist party.  Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  04:30, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n 'Will open the way to communism'. There is no explicit statement here the party would implement communism. I can understand how it could be interrupted as this being implied, but unless its directly stated, it can't be placed here as if it is fact. Please see  WP:SYNTHESIS  (especially in regarded to the split). As said before, a lot of this information you give appears to be original research, which is not applicable by Wikipedia's standards.  Helper201  ( talk ) 04:38, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Please explain why you have removed a direct quotation from the party platform, properly referenced, from the article. Can you cite any sources that say this is not a communist party?  Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  04:54, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n This party makes it  crystal clear  that it is a  Marxist-Leninist  organization, which is the ideology of communism. To refuse to include their overt self identification in the article is unencyclopedic, in my opinion.  Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  05:07, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Please read up on communism and Marxism-Leninism. While they are often implemented simultaneously and are relevant to one another, they are not the same. There's still a lot of reading between the lines here.  Helper201  ( talk ) 05:14, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n No, I will not stop, although I will discuss to try to reach consensus with you. With all due respect, I have been \"reading up\" on communism and Marxism-Leninism for 50 years and have studied the history of many such parties. Communism is their ultimate goal and Marxism-Leninism is the current ideology. This particilar party openly embraces Marxism-Leninism and describes communism as the ultimate goal of socialist revolution carried out by the armed working class, which they openly favor. I have read their newspaper, attended one of their street demonstrations, and listened to speeches by leading members. I am absolutely certain that they are a communist, Marxist-Leninist party and I have referenced public party documents readily available online. Why do you resist descriptions that are verifiable and neutral?  Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  05:39, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n That's exactly what you are not doing. You have been going and making changes mid-discussion regardless, totally ignoring and overruling what's being talked about here. As I have outlined, a lot of what you are saying falls exactly under  Wikipedia:No original research . As regard to your last question, I have answered this numerous times as falling under  WP:SYNTHESIS . This is just circling now.  Helper201  ( talk ) 05:46, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Please explain how it is synthesis to describe a party as Marxist-Leninist when its own party publications openly describe it that way?  Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  06:05, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n I saw nothing in that source that explicitly said the party is Marxist-Leninist.  Helper201  ( talk ) 06:10, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Please suggest alternate wording, then. In my opinion, you are splitting hairs and denying the obvious. We can get a third opinion or formulate an RFC. Which do you prefer?  Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  06:26, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Do you mean Request For Comments? If you want to take this through an official Wikipedia body then OK. I think that would be much better than just a third opinion, which doesn't hold anywhere near as much weight.

Cullen 328   Let's discuss it  07:04, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Apologies but I have no desire to seek to add to the page. I think it is largely alright the way it is.  Helper201  ( talk ) 07:12, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n July 2017 [ edit ] \n  Hello. Everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to Wikipedia. This means that editors  do not own articles , including ones they create, and should respect the work of their fellow contributors\u00a0on  Party for Socialism and Liberation . If you create or edit an article, remember that others are free to change its content. Take a look at the  welcome page  to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Thank you.  TM  10:49, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Likewise, I've noticed that you have made more than  3 reverts  to this article in the last 24 hours. Please refrain from further reverts or I will report this incident.-- TM  10:50, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n First of all, why could we not discuss this prior to you making mass changes? Secondly, I am fine with the article being changed if reliable sources support this. I see the new article you have added does support the party by specifically stating it as Marxist-Leninist. I'm just about to look into the source to check its credibility. I don't see why you couldn't have talked to me first or contributed to the discussion on the talk page. You are making a lot of changes without giving reason, such as reinstating it being communist etc. Also the the other source provided breaks Wikipedia's synthesis, so should not be re-included.  Helper201  ( talk ) 10:57, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n With six reverts in the last 24 hours, it seems as though you are well beyond talking. You've decided what can and cannot be in the article. I've added a third party source which backs up the common sense argument contrary to the one you've been making.-- TM  11:04, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n I gave good reason for why I made those changes. I would also like to point out the other editor was the one making changes mid-discussion, in most cases before I had even had a chance to reply to their comment. Also as I said, I accepted the third-party source, yet you give no good reason for re-instating the other source, or why you have included it among the list of communist parties. Your ridicule in terms of implying my argument is not \"common sense\" as opposed to yours I find unpleasant and unhelpful.  Helper201  ( talk ) 11:15, 27 July 2017 (UTC) \n Workers' Party of Belgium [ edit ] \n I have noticed that three times already you have undone an edit by me on the article  Workers' Party of Belgium . More specifically it's about whether the WPB is communist party or not. I see no evidence to conclude that the current party is communist, the party itself doesn't claim to be communist either. So I wonder why you keep insisting to describe the party as a communist party, instead of opting for the much wider accepted label of socialism, a label the WPB itself uses. I'm going to revert it to socialist again, if you want to put it back to communist, then you should provide a source that shows that the WPB in its current form can be classified as a communist party. \n Sincerely HistorXIII \n Hey, HistorXIII. Apologies, I shouldn't have done so. I shall have a look into evidence for both socialism and communism and see what has supporting evidence. I appreciate that you took the time to come to my talk page and talk to me about this without being hostile. I'm going through a lot of really bad stuff right now, not that that's any excuse, just that it means more to me that you came and respectfully put across your point of view. Thank you.  Helper201  ( talk ) 13:59, 29 July 2017 (UTC) \n MOS:TIES [ edit ] \n The game developer's nationality does not constitute  strong national ties , especially such that you should feel emboldened to drive-by engvar-war across multiple articles. Please form a consensus for widespread changes before embarking on a crusade, against the recommendations of policy.  \u00a0 czar  22:53, 9 August 2017 (UTC) \n There was no reason given for using US dating systems. Wikipedia dating systems are usually down to the discretion of editors, as for most page types there is no specific required format. I gave good reason as to why this version is more appropriate. There seems to be large amount of Americanisation of Wikipedia pages for no good reason. Unless the page is related to something to do with the US I see no reason to use the MDY format, as the US is the only country in the world to use this format. \n Date format by country .  Helper201  ( talk ) 23:00, 9 August 2017 (UTC) \n Why could you not even give me a first minutes to reply before reverting all my edits?  Helper201  ( talk ) 23:01, 9 August 2017 (UTC) \n Since you are not a new editor, you know about the  Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle  and how, when your proposed edits are contested (read: reverted), your next step is taking the proposal to discussion, not to wantonly revert the revert, which is  edit warring . That warning aside, as I already said, there is no  strong national tie  to the subject to warrant any mass action on dates, and even if you thought there was, the relevant policy is  to retain the existing date/engvar format  until some consensus overturns it. Which isn't even to mention the disreputable practice of making large, drive-by changes (on articles you haven't edited), changes explicitly against our common guidelines, leaving no  edit summaries  and then edit warring those changes. So no, there is no need to wait to revert those changes. (On a more common sense note, I have no idea how you think that  Donkey Kong 64 , a featured article reviewed several times, would change its date format on your whim...) Please do not make systematic drive-by edits without consensus. The policy on changing date formats exists precisely to stop your type of unilateral action. If you don't like it, take it up with the community, whereupon you'll find why the policy is what it is.  \u00a0 czar  05:06, 10 August 2017 (UTC) \n I wouldn't call a handful of pages \"mass action\". Yes there is no strong national tie, which works both ways, it means there is no strong justification for using the US dating system either. As I said, there is more reason for using this dating system, as these games have no connection with the US and the US is the only country to use this dating system, so I don't see what reason you have for being so protective of keeping it as it is. Just because something hasn't been changed in a long time does not make it any more correct. I've seen plenty of stuff on Wikipedia that hasn't been cited in years (sometimes going back to 2012 from 2017) even when its been edited multiple times. This in no way justifies its inclusion. And I wouldn't call making dating format changes \"large drive by\" edits. I honestly don't see why you are being so protective of keeping things as they are (and not giving any good reason why using the US dating system is appropriate in any way). As said, the vast majority of the world does not use the US dating system, so why if the page has no connection to the US should this be maintained?  Helper201  ( talk ) 18:34, 10 August 2017 (UTC) \n Yes, six unrelated pages in succession is systemic. I already linked  WP:DATERET  above\u2014can't be any clearer that the existing format is retained when there is no reason (e.g., a strong national tie) to change the English/date variation. Strong national ties are physical places and battles that take place in a specific region/nation. If you have a problem with the policy, take it up with the policy page, but don't think that your edits against that consensus will go unchecked.  czar  22:49, 10 August 2017 (UTC) \n Well they are all video game related aren't they? So Rome Total War, that game certainly represents battles in a specific region, by specific nations, in Europe, does it not? There is no perfect clarity on what does and does not constitute a strong national tie. I plan to take this to further discussion, please could you give me the link? Also I have been trying to discuss this. The only \"consensus\" I've broken is Wikipedia ruling, which since reverting your reverts I haven't reverted again, nor made any more date changes and have been trying to discuss with you, despite being mainly just being dictated Wikipedia rules. May I also point out the MOS:TIES does also state \"or consensus on the article's talk page\", which as I said, I've been trying to make, despite only being rejected by you, and just because of Wikipedia ruling. You haven't been open to discussing this and I really don't see the point in this \"don't think that your edits against that consensus will go unchecked\", as like I've said, I haven't done so and I really think this hostile and threatening manner is highly unhelpful.  Helper201  ( talk ) 02:48, 13 August 2017 (UTC) \n August 2017 [ edit ] \n  Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did at  Portuguese Communist Party . Your edits appear to constitute  vandalism  and have been  reverted . If you would like to experiment, please use the  sandbox . Repeated vandalism can result in the  loss of editing privileges .  B.Lameira  ( talk ) 22:26, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n So what you disagree with constitutes to vandalism, despite not even getting a supporting opinion when resorting to contacting another editor to support you against me? Why could you not use the talk page as I asked to discuss this reasonably, rather than just reverting my edits without evidence to support your argument? You have provided no evidence to prove you are right and you have no right to call my edits vandalism or claim to be any more correct than I am. What you are doing is basically edit warring and what you have changed has stood for a long time without rejection from other editors.  Helper201  ( talk ) 22:32, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n Also, another point. Threats on Wikipedia get you no where, so please don't use them. I noted that The Guardian piece was an opinion piece after you mentioned it and I did not notice this when I added it (hence why I did not reverse that edit). Second, you have no consensus for your edits either and you have been the one removing the label of far-left, which has long stood on the page, you are the one seeking the change. And we were both giving points as to where the party stands, I regard neither yours nor mine as \"bias\", hence why I wished to take the discussion to talk, as when a conflict arises this is how things should be sorted, not by reverting and re-reverting constantly or making threats to other users.  Helper201  ( talk ) 22:44, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n You have quite a long history of edit warring, your actions are not new. Without rejection? Did you happen to think most editors do not have a clue about what the party's positions are? Your edits are not encyclopaedic and you make yourself look bad with your persistent history of conflicts in here, you inserted an op-ed article as reference, how can you say your behaviour is not disruptive, with the only goal of forcing your biased POV on other editors who do not happen to agree with you? -- B.Lameira  ( talk ) 22:39, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n That is your judgment from scanning my page. I would disagree, there has been a lot of vandalism going on by certain editors and people that have not been willing to discuss via talk page, regardless that is not relevant to this matter. I was the one that offered to go to talk. You are the one who has only reverted and re-reverted and threatened.  Helper201  ( talk ) 22:52, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n I am not threatening you, do not play as so defensive, I am only warning that your disruptive behaviour does not match the spirit of consensus that makes up Wikipedia, any user can issue such message as I did. Try to seek consensus, if possible, as up for now, you do not have. I am not always in here, hence I did not notice it at first. Cheers!  B.Lameira  ( talk ) 22:54, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n Exactly, that is why I wished to discuss it via the talk page, as your changes to what had long been on the page had no supporting evidence, nor consensus.  Helper201  ( talk ) 23:01, 25 August 2017 (UTC) \n Your edits [ edit ] \n Hello, please stop making unconstructive edits on pages of political parties. Party ideology can be sourced by proper citations, but by the wiki policy, it is not necessary. Only questioned source request of proper information can be later removed. Thank you. -- ThecentreCZ  ( talk ) 17:44, 15 September 2017 (UTC) \n Question [ edit ] \n Another question, why are you obsessed with capital letters? -- ThecentreCZ  ( talk ) 18:14, 15 September 2017 (UTC) \n Obsessed? Not at all. The section within the info box that says e.g. \"Right-wing to far-right\", this is a sentence, so then why should the second position be capitalised? This is not correct grammar as a political position should not be capitalised unless it begins a sentence. Only the first letter of the first word needs to be a capital in this case. As to your other point made above this one, I really don't see what you are getting at. I have been editing political pages on Wikipedia for a long time and it's primarily what I do on here. Any content unsourced can be removed, claims should always be made using reliable sources.  WP:USI . If you want to make constructive criticism please be specific. Thank you.  Helper201  ( talk ) 01:24, 17 September 2017 (UTC) \n Democratic Progressive Party [ edit ] \n Hi Helper201, how is the information in the infobox a sentence? Thanks,  Ezhao02  ( talk ) 01:29, 20 September 2017 (UTC) \n Hmm, I'm not sure how it isn't. If it's a list or just one word, like a bullet point, then I wouldn't say so. However if it appears to form a sentence (i.e. it's more than one word and isn't a list), such as something is \"from here to here\" then I would say its safe to assume its a sentence and should follow standard grammar rules for sentences. Otherwise if there are no grammar rules, anything could go, every word could be a capital, or other such things that wouldn't appear to show any reason. Cheers, and thank you for taking the time to message me.

I'm a little confused by your revert on the NPD article. Brown is generally accepted as the customary colour of the NPD by Wikipedia itself, hence the template colour being a dark brown. As for a citation; the CDU article doesn't have one, and all Die Linke has is a link to some election results.  JackWilfred  ( talk ) 22:06, 26 September 2017 (UTC) \n Hi. The only use of dark brown I can see is the outline of the info box, which as far as I'm aware any editor can change. All the logos and images provided in the article only show the use of a red, white and black colour scheme.  Helper201  ( talk ) 22:18, 26 September 2017 (UTC) \n I've provided a citation for NPD's customary colour being brown. Thanks for your quick response.  JackWilfred  ( talk ) 23:28, 26 September 2017 (UTC) \n Harry Kane [ edit ] \n Thank you for showing me the Kane biography, which indeed comes from the respected sports writer  Frank Worrall . Can that be cited, even though we do not know the page number?  Harambe Walks  ( talk ) 21:27, 6 October 2017 (UTC) \n No problem and I appreciate the thanks. I don't see why not, as you said, its a respected source. I have found the right page before via a Google search, its only a couple of pages in as far as I recall. However, the preview I used on Google Books didn't seem to give the number for each corresponding page. So I'm not sure where exactly page 1 begins (as it can differ for some books) to thereby deduce which page number the quote is on exactly, in order to then reference it properly. Perhaps there is a way to see the page numbers and I just missed it. I saw there are a few more Daily Mail citations on the page that also need replacing (and were marked as such a few months ago). I've managed to replace another one, any help replacing the rest would also be appreciated. Cheers.

Kaffe42  ( talk ) 19:42, 11 November 2017 (UTC) \n Broadsheet and former broadsheet newspapers - Updated The Guardian political stance [ edit ] \n Hi mate. I changed the political leaning of The Guardian from centre-left to left-wing, sourcing this YouGov poll,  https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/03/07/how-left-or-right-wing-are-uks-newspapers/ . However, you reversed it (without Talk or any further sourcing?) A newspaper, such as the Guardian, may claim to be 'centre-left', but if that is not reflected in it's content, then it's not true. The newspaper (and website) have clearly been moving further to the left in recent years, as evidenced by this poll, no? Thanks mate  John arneVN  ( talk ) 05:17, 17 November 2017 (UTC) \n This is a poll of the opinions of the UK general public, peoples opinions are not what is taken into regard when deciding the position of a paper. What is taken into regard is evidence from reliable sources, especially academics. I would highly recommend you take this to the paper's talk page before making any changes.  Helper201  ( talk ) 11:55, 17 November 2017 (UTC) \n Hi mate - I have taken it to the Talkpage. A Yougov poll is better than nothing, surely? - I have put forward a source for the Guardian being left-wing (particularly socially, rather than politically - if we describe other papers as right-wing, the Guardian, in my opinion, should be left-wing), and so far nothing has been put forward to suggest that it should be centre-left - I would also argue that public opinion is very important with regards to discussing a papers political leaning (given that these spectrums are always moving). Even the Guardians own Wiki page describes it as \"The newspaper's reputation as a platform for liberal and left-wing editorial has led to...\". Also - I saw above that you changed some date formats to the standard format, rather than the American-only format - good on ya - Wiki has been slowly Americanizing lately - and we have to stop it.  John arneVN  ( talk ) 07:54, 20 November 2017 (UTC) \n Thanks for taking it to the talk page. Yeah, evidence is always important, however in this case I wouldn't say public opinion is evidence. For example if 99% of people believed all sand was red, would that make it red? Like that example this is a case where public opinion does not equal fact. I can see a case for the paper potentially being socially left-wing, but definitely not politically or economically, in these cases I'd definitely say centre-left. The quote you mentioned to me almost seems contradictory, being in western Europe and the UK liberalism is largely associated with the centre of the political spectrum. Maybe that is another reason for it being labelled centre-left? As it says liberal and left-wing the in-between of centre and left-wing is centre-left. I believe this has been discussed a lot on The Guardian's talk page over the years (these discussions I'd assume have now mostly been archived, so it may be hard to find them) but I believe the centre-left tag has been developed through consensus over the years. I think it would take quite a bit of evidence to form a consensus on the papers talk page to change this.  Helper201  ( talk ) 20:22, 23 November 2017 (UTC) \n Your disruptive editing on  Socialist Party (Ireland) [ edit ] \n Please end your disruptive editing warring on this page by constantly reverting. You are ignoring plain reason and material that is self-evidently true. You do not have consensus for this behaviour. You have ignored the comments of other editors on similar and related talk pages. This is a clear case of  WP:ICAN'THEARYOU . Your persisntent reverting is extremely disruptive and unhelpful behavior.  Laurel Lodged  ( talk ) 16:19, 24 November 2017 (UTC) \n Excuse me, I have ignored!? You were the one who was asked to take the matter to talk (and simply ignored it entirely), you are the one who is constantly reverting content that has long stood on this page. Your 'self-evident' claim is nonsense. One ideology of a party does not make it self-evidently fit into only one political position. As clearly outlined here  Wikipedia:Edit warring , where there is dispute it should be taken to the talk page.
