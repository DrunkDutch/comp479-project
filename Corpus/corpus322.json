IIROC is also recognized by the Financial and Consumer Services  Commission of New Brunswick, the Newfoundland and Labrador Office of the  Superintendent of Securities, and the Prince  Edward Island\u00a0Office of the Superintendent of Securities  (Recognizing Regulators).\u00a0\u00a0  \n Based on the  annual assessment of IIROC\u2019s functional areas and key processes, the  Recognizing Regulators selected above-average risk areas as the focus for the  review, including Business Conduct Compliance, Enforcement, Information  Technology, Market Surveillance, and Trade Review & Analysis. The  Recognizing Regulators considered the previous oversight review and whether  findings identified in that review had been resolved, as well as current issues  and market conditions that could affect IIROC.  \n In summary, CSA  staff acknowledge that IIROC made sufficient progress in resolving specific  issues raised in previous oversight reports. However, CSA staff note a repeat  finding in the Business Conduct Compliance department given IIROC did not  implement necessary changes to their examination programs (high priority).  Also, CSA staff found that IIROC did not make sufficient progress in resolving an  issue raised during the previous oversight review in the area of Information  Technology (medium priority) by not providing an information security program  report to a Board committee on a quarterly basis. In addition, CSA staff raise other medium priority findings in the  Business Conduct Compliance (one), Information Technology (one) and Enforcement  (two) departments.  \n CSA staff will  actively monitor IIROC\u2019s progress in addressing the findings outlined in the  report.  \n The CSA, the  council of the securities regulators of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories,  co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets. \n - 30 - \n For more information: \n Kristen\n            Rose \n            Ontario Securities Commission \n            416-593-2336 \n Hilary McMeekin \n            Alberta Securities Commission \n            403-592-8186 \n Alison Walker \n            British Columbia Securities Commission \n            604-899-6713  \n            Sylvain Th\u00e9berge \n            Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers \n            514-940-2176\n Jason (Jay) Booth \n            Manitoba Securities Commission \n            204-945-1660 \n Andrew\n            Nicholson \n            Financial and Consumer Services \n            Commission, New Brunswick \n            506-658-3021\n David Harrison \n            Nova Scotia Securities Commission \n            902\u00a0424-8586 \n            Janice Callbeck \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            P.E.I \n            902-368-6288\n            John O\u2019Brien \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            Newfoundland and Labrador \n            709-729-4909\n            Rhonda Horte \n            Office of the Yukon Superintendent \n            of Securities \n            867-667-5466\n            Jeff Mason \n            Nunavut Securities Office \n            867-975-6591 \n Tom\n            Hall \n            Northwest Territories Securities Office \n            867-767-9305\n            Shannon McMillan \n            Financial and Consumer Affairs \n            Authority of Saskatchewan \n            306-798-4160\n Contact  | \n                                     Legal  |\n                                     Legislation  |\n                                     Accessibility  |\n                                     Fran\u00e7ais \n \u00a9 Ontario Securities Commission 2017 \n Government of Ontario \n JavaScript is disabled or not supported by this browser.
