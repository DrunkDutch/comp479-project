The name is an  acronym  which stands for \" Compact Disc  Read-Only Memory \". Computers can read CD-ROMs, but cannot write to CD-ROMs, which are not writable or erasable. \n From the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, CD-ROMs were popularly used to distribute  software  for computers and  video game consoles . Some CDs, called  enhanced CDs , hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a  CD player , while data (such as software or digital video) is only usable on a computer (such as  ISO 9660 [2]  format PC CD-ROMs). \n The CD-ROM format was developed by Japanese company  Denon  in 1982. It was an extension of  Compact Disc Digital Audio , and adapted the format to hold any form of digital data, with a storage capacity of 553  MiB . [3]  CD-ROM was then introduced by Denon and  Sony  at a Japanese computer show in 1984. [4]  The  Yellow Book  is the  technical standard  that defines the format of CD-ROMs. One of a set of  color-bound books  that contain the  technical specifications  for all CD formats, the  Yellow Book , standardized by Sony and  Philips  in 1983, has a capacity of 650 MiB. \n Contents \n 1   CD-ROM discs \n 1.1   Media \n 1.2   Standard \n 1.3   CD-ROM format \n 1.4   CD-ROM XA extension \n 1.5   Disc images \n 1.6   Manufacture \n 1.7   Capacity \n 2   CD-ROM drives \n 2.1   Laser and optics \n 2.2   Transfer rates \n 3   Copyright issues \n 4   See also \n 5   Notes \n 6   References \n CD-ROM discs [ edit ] \n Media [ edit ] \nA CD-ROM in the tray of a partially open DVD-ROM drive. \n CD-ROMs are identical in appearance to  audio CDs , and data are stored and retrieved in a very similar manner (only differing from audio CDs in the standards used to store the data). Discs are made from a 1.2\u00a0mm thick disc of  polycarbonate   plastic , with a thin layer of  aluminium  to make a reflective surface. The most common size of CD-ROM is 120\u00a0mm in diameter, though the smaller  Mini CD  standard with an 80\u00a0mm diameter, as well as  shaped compact discs  in numerous non-standard sizes and molds (e.g.,  business card-sized media ), are also available. [ citation needed ] \n Data is stored on the disc as a series of microscopic indentations. A  laser  is shone onto the reflective surface of the disc to read the pattern of pits and lands (\"pits\", with the gaps between them referred to as \"lands\"). Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the wavelength of the laser light used to read the disc, the reflected  beam 's  phase  is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing  destructive interference  and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This pattern of changing intensity of the reflected beam is converted into binary data. \n Standard [ edit ] \n Several formats are used for data stored on compact discs, known as the  Rainbow Books . The  Yellow Book , published in 1988, [5]  defines the specifications for CD-ROMs, standardized in 1989 as the  ISO / IEC  10149 /  ECMA -130 standard. The CD-ROM standard builds on top of the original  Red Book   CD-DA  standard for CD audio. Other standards, such as the  White Book  for  Video CDs , further define formats based on the CD-ROM specifications. The  Yellow Book  itself is not freely available, but the standards with the corresponding content can be downloaded for free from ISO [1]  or ECMA. [6] \n There are several standards that define how to structure data files on a CD-ROM.  ISO 9660  defines the standard  file system  for a CD-ROM.  ISO 13490  is an improvement on this standard which adds support for non-sequential  write-once  and re-writeable discs such as  CD-R  and  CD-RW , as well as  multiple sessions . The ISO 13346 standard was designed to address most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660, [7]  and a subset of it evolved into the  UDF  format, which was adopted for  DVDs . The bootable CD specification was issued in January 1995, to make a CD emulate a  hard disk  or  floppy disk , is called  El Torito . \n CD-ROM format [ edit ] \n Data stored on CD-ROMs follows the standard  CD data encoding  techniques described in the  Red Book  specification (originally defined for  audio CD  only). This includes  cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding  (CIRC),  eight-to-fourteen modulation  (EFM), and the use of  pits and lands  for coding the bits into the physical surface of the CD. \n The structures used to group data on a CD-ROM are also derived from the  Red Book . Like audio CDs (CD-DA), a CD-ROM  sector  contains 2,352  bytes  of user data, composed of 98 frames, each consisting of 33-bytes (24 bytes for the user data, 8 bytes for error correction, and 1 byte for the subcode). Unlike audio CDs, the data stored in these sectors corresponds to any type of digital data, not audio samples encoded according to the audio CD specification. To structure, address and protect this data, the CD-ROM standard further defines two sector modes, Mode 1 and Mode 2, which describe two different layouts for the data inside a sector. [2]  A  track  (a group of sectors) inside a CD-ROM only contains sectors in the same mode, but if multiple tracks are present in a CD-ROM, each track can have its sectors in a different mode from the rest of the tracks. They can also coexist with audio CD tracks as well, which is the case of  mixed mode CDs . \n Both Mode 1 and 2 sectors use the first 16 bytes for  header  information, but differ in the remaining 2,336 bytes due to the use of  error correction  bytes. Unlike an audio CD, a CD-ROM cannot rely on error concealment by  interpolation ; a higher reliability of the retrieved data is required. To achieve improved error correction and detection, Mode 1, used mostly for digital data, adds a 32-bit  cyclic redundancy check  (CRC) code for error detection, and a third layer of  Reed\u2013Solomon error correction [n 1]  using a Reed-Solomon Product-like Code (RSPC). Mode 1 therefore contains 288 bytes per sector for error detection and correction, leaving 2,048 bytes per sector available for data. Mode 2, which is more appropriate for image or video data (where perfect reliability may be a little bit less important), contains no additional error detection or correction bytes, having therefore 2,336 available data bytes per sector. Note that both modes, like audio CDs, still benefit from the  lower layers of error correction  at the frame level. [8] \n Before being stored on a disc with the techniques described above, each CD-ROM sector is scrambled to prevent some problematic patterns from showing up. [6]  These scrambled sectors then follow the same encoding process described in the  Red Book  in order to be finally stored on a CD. \n The following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CD-DA and CD-ROMs: [6] \n Format \n \u2190 2,352 byte sector structure \u2192 \n CD digital audio: \n 2,352 (Digital audio) \n CD-ROM Mode 1: \n 12 (Sync pattern) \n 3 (Address) \n 1 (Mode, 0x01) \n 2,048 (Data) \n 4 (Error detection) \n 8 (Reserved, zero) \n 276 (Error correction) \n CD-ROM Mode 2: \n 12 (Sync pattern) \n 3 (Address) \n 1 (Mode, 0x02) \n 2,336 (Data) \n The net byte rate of a Mode-1 CD-ROM, based on comparison to CD-DA audio standards, is 44,100\u00a0Hz \u00d7 16 bits/sample \u00d7 2  channels  \u00d7 2,048 / 2,352 / 8 = 153.6  kB/s  = 150  KiB/s . This value, 150 KiB/s, is defined as \"1\u00d7 speed\". Therefore, for Mode 1 CD-ROMs, a 1\u00d7 CD-ROM drive reads 150/2 = 75 consecutive sectors per second. \n The playing time of a standard CD is 74 minutes, or 4,440 seconds, contained in 333,000 blocks or  sectors . Therefore, the net capacity of a Mode-1 CD-ROM is 682  MB  or, equivalently, 650  MiB . For 80 minute CDs, the capacity is 737 MB (703 MiB). \n CD-ROM XA extension [ edit ] \n CD-ROM XA  is an extension of the  Yellow Book  standard for CD-ROMs that combines compressed audio, video and computer data, allowing all to be accessed simultaneously. [9]  It was intended as a bridge between CD-ROM and  CD-i  ( Green Book ) and was published by  Sony  and  Philips  in 1991. [5]  \"XA\" stands for eXtended Architecture. \n CD-ROM XA defines two new sector layouts, called Mode 2 Form 1 and Mode 2 Form 2 (which are different from the original Mode 2). XA Mode 2 Form 1 is similar to the Mode 1 structure described above, and can interleave with XA Mode 2 Form 2 sectors; it is used for data. XA Mode 2 Form 2 has 2,324 bytes of user data, and is similar to the standard Mode 2 but with error detection bytes added (though no error correction). It can interleave with XA Mode 2 Form 1 sectors, and it is used for audio/video data. [8]   Video CDs ,  Super Video CDs ,  Photo CDs ,  Enhanced Music CDs  and  CD-i  use these sector modes. [10] \n The following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CD-ROM XA modes: \n Format \n \u2190 2,352 byte sector structure \u2192 \n CD-ROM XA Mode 2, Form 1: \n 12 (Sync pattern) \n 3 (Address) \n 1 (Mode) \n 8 (Subheader) \n 2,048 (Data) \n 4 (Error detection) \n 276 (Error correction) \n CD-ROM XA Mode 2, Form 2: \n 12 (Sync pattern) \n 3 (Address) \n 1 (Mode) \n 8 (Subheader) \n 2,324 (Data) \n 4 (Error detection) \n Disc images [ edit ] \n When a  disc image  of a CD-ROM is created, this can be done in either \"raw\" mode (extracting 2,352 bytes per sector, independent of the internal structure), or obtaining only the sector's useful data (2,048/2,336/2,352/2,324 bytes depending on the CD-ROM mode). The file size of a disc image created in raw mode is  always  a multiple of 2,352 bytes (the size of a block). [11]  Disc image formats that store raw CD-ROM sectors include  CCD/IMG ,  CUE/BIN , and  MDS/MDF . The size of a disc image created from the data in the sectors will depend on the type of sectors it is using. For example, if a CD-ROM mode 1 image is created by extracting only each sector's data, its size will be a multiple of 2,048; this is usually the case for  ISO disc images . \n On a 74-minute CD-R, it is possible to fit larger disc images using raw mode, up to 333,000 \u00d7 2,352 = 783,216,000 bytes (~747 MiB). This is the upper limit for raw images created on a 74 min or \u2248650 MiB  Red Book  CD. The 14.8% increase is due to the discarding of error correction data. \n Manufacture [ edit ] \n Main article:  Compact Disc manufacturing \n Pre-pressed CD-ROMs are mass-produced by a process of stamping where a glass master disc is created and used to make \"stampers\", which are in turn used to manufacture multiple copies of the final disc with the pits already present. Recordable ( CD-R ) and rewritable ( CD-RW ) discs are manufactured by a different method, whereby the data are recorded on them by a laser changing the properties of a dye or  phase transition  material in a process that is often referred to as \" burning \". \n Capacity [ edit ] \nA CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio & video clips \n CD-ROM capacities are normally expressed with  binary prefixes , subtracting the space used for error correction data. A standard 120\u00a0mm,  700 MB  CD-ROM can actually hold about 737 MB (703 MiB) of data with error correction (or 847 MB total). In comparison, a single-layer  DVD-ROM  can hold 4.7 GB of error-protected data, more than 6 CD-ROMs. \n Capacities of Compact Disc types (90 and 99 minute discs are not standard) \n Type \n Sectors \n Data max. size \n Audio max. size \n Time \n ( MB ) \n Approx.

You can help by  adding to it .   (June 2014) \n Further information:  Optical disc drive \nA view of a CD-ROM drive's disassembled laser system \nThe movement of the laser enables reading at any position of the CD \nThe laser system of a CD-ROM drive \n CD-ROM discs are read using CD-ROM drives. A CD-ROM drive may be connected to the computer via an IDE ( ATA ),  SCSI ,  SATA ,  FireWire , or  USB  interface or a proprietary interface, such as the  Panasonic CD interface , LMSI/Philips, Sony and Mitsumi standards, . Virtually all modern CD-ROM drives can also play  audio CDs  (as well as  Video CDs  and other data standards) when used with the right software. \n Laser and optics [ edit ] \n CD-ROM drives employ a near- infrared  780  nm   laser diode . The laser beam is directed onto the disc via an opto-electronic tracking module, which then detects whether the beam has been reflected or scattered. \n Transfer rates [ edit ] \n CD-ROM drives are rated with a speed factor relative to music CDs. If a CD-ROM is read at the same rotational speed as an  audio CD , the data transfer rate is 150 KiB/s, commonly called \"1\u00d7\". At this data rate, the track moves along under the laser spot at about 1.2\u00a0m/s. To maintain this linear velocity as the optical head moves to different positions, the angular velocity is varied from 500  rpm  at the inner edge to 200 rpm at the outer edge. The 1\u00d7 speed rating for CD-ROM (150 KiB/s) is different from the 1\u00d7 speed rating for  DVDs  (1.32 MiB/s). \n By increasing the speed at which the disc is spun, data can be transferred at greater rates. For example, a CD-ROM drive that can read at 8\u00d7 speed spins the disc at 1600 to 4000 rpm, giving a linear velocity of 9.6\u00a0m/s and a transfer rate of 1200 KiB/s. Above 12\u00d7 speed most drives read at  Constant angular velocity  (CAV, constant rpm) so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc. In CAV mode the \"\u00d7\" number denotes the transfer rate at the outer edge of the disc, where it is a maximum. 20\u00d7 was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until  Samsung  Electronics introduced the SCR-3230, a 32x CD-ROM drive which uses a ball  bearing  system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004, the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52\u00d7 or 10,400 rpm and 7.62 MiB/s. Higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made. At 52\u00d7, the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disk is around 65\u00a0m/s. However, improvements can still be obtained using multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the  Kenwood  TrueX 72\u00d7 which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10\u00d7. \n Faster 12\u00d7 drives were common beginning in early 1997. Above 12\u00d7 speed, there are problems with vibration and heat. CAV drives give speeds up to 30\u00d7 at the outer edge of the disc with the same rotational speed as a standard constant linear velocity (CLV) 12\u00d7, or 32\u00d7 with a slight increase. However, due to the nature of CAV (linear speed at the inner edge is still only 12\u00d7, increasing smoothly in-between) the actual throughput increase is less than 30/12: in fact, roughly 20\u00d7 average for a completely full disc, and even less for a partially filled one. \n Problems with vibration, owing to limits on achievable symmetry and strength in mass-produced media, mean that CD-ROM drive speeds have not massively increased since the late 1990s. Over 10 years later, commonly available drives vary between 24\u00d7 (slimline and portable units, 10\u00d7 spin speed) and 52\u00d7 (typically CD- and read-only units, 21\u00d7 spin speed), all using CAV to achieve their claimed \"max\" speeds, with 32\u00d7 through 48\u00d7 most common. Even so, these speeds can cause poor reading (drive error correction having become very sophisticated in response) and even shattering of poorly made or physically damaged media, with small cracks rapidly growing into catastrophic breakages when centripetally stressed at 10,000\u201313,000 rpm (i.e. 40\u201352\u00d7 CAV). High rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise from disc vibration, rushing air and the spindle motor itself. Most 21st-century drives allow forced low speed modes (by use of small utility programs) for the sake of safety, accurate reading or silence, and will automatically fall back if numerous sequential read errors and retries are encountered. \n Other methods of improving read speed were trialled such as using multiple optical beams, increasing throughput up to 72\u00d7 with a 10\u00d7 spin speed, but along with other technologies like 90~99 minute recordable media and \"double density\" recorders, their utility was nullified by the introduction of consumer  DVD-ROM  drives capable of consistent 36\u00d7 CD-ROM speeds (4\u00d7 DVD) or higher. Additionally, with a 700 MB CD-ROM fully readable in under 2\u00bd minutes at 52\u00d7 CAV, increases in actual data transfer rate are decreasingly influential on overall effective drive speed when taken into consideration with other factors such as loading/unloading, media recognition, spin up/down and random seek times, making for much decreased returns on development investment. A similar stratification effect has since been seen in DVD development where maximum speed has stabilised at 16\u00d7 CAV (with exceptional cases between 18\u00d7 and 22\u00d7) and capacity at 4.3 and 8.5  GiB  (single and dual layer), with higher speed and capacity needs instead being catered to by Blu-ray drives. \n CD-Recordable drives are often sold with three different speed ratings, one speed for write-once operations, one for re-write operations, and one for read-only operations. The speeds are typically listed in that order; i.e. a 12\u00d7/10\u00d7/32\u00d7 CD drive can, CPU and media permitting, write to CD-R discs at 12\u00d7 speed (1.76 MiB/s), write to CD-RW discs at 10\u00d7 speed (1.46 MiB/s), and read from CDs at 32\u00d7 speed (4.69 MiB/s). \n Common data transfer speeds for CD-ROM drives \n Transfer speed \n KiB/s \n Mbit/s \n MiB/s   [n 2] \n RPM \n 1\u00d7 \n 150 \n 1.2288 \n 0.146 \n 200\u2013500 \n 2\u00d7 \n 300 \n 2.4576 \n 0.293 \n 400-1,000 \n 4\u00d7 \n 600 \n 4.9152 \n 0.586 \n 800\u20132,000 \n 8\u00d7 \n 1,200 \n 9.8304 \n 1.17 \n 1,600\u20134,000 \n 10\u00d7 \n 1,500 \n 12.288 \n 1.46 \n 2,000\u20135,000 \n 12\u00d7 \n 1,800 \n 14.7456 \n 1.76 \n 2,400\u20136,000 \n 20\u00d7 \n 1,200\u20133,000 \n up to 24.576 \n up to 2.93 \n 4,000 ( CAV ) \n 32\u00d7 \n 1,920\u20134,800 \n up to 39.3216 \n up to 4.69 \n 6,400 ( CAV ) \n 36\u00d7 \n 2,160\u20135,400 \n up to 44.2368 \n up to 5.27 \n 7,200 ( CAV ) \n 40\u00d7 \n 2,400\u20136,000 \n up to 49.152 \n up to 5.86 \n 8,000 ( CAV ) \n 48\u00d7 \n 2,880\u20137,200 \n up to 58.9824 \n up to 7.03 \n 9,600 ( CAV ) \n 52\u00d7 \n 3,120\u20137,800 \n up to 63.8976 \n up to 7.62 \n 10,400 ( CAV ) \n 56\u00d7 \n 3,360\u20138,400 \n up to 68.8128 \n up to 8.20 \n 11,200 ( CAV ) \n 72\u00d7 \n 6,750\u201310,800 \n up to 88.4736 \n up to 10.5 \n 2,000 (multi-beam) \n Copyright issues [ edit ] \n Main article:  Compact Disc and DVD copy protection \n Software distributors, and in particular distributors of computer games, often make use of various copy protection schemes to prevent software running from any media besides the original CD-ROMs. This differs somewhat from  audio CD  protection in that it is usually implemented in both the media and the software itself. The CD-ROM itself may contain \"weak\" sectors to make copying the disc more difficult, and additional data that may be difficult or impossible to copy to a CD-R or disc image, but which the software checks for each time it is run to ensure an original disc and not an unauthorized copy is present in the computer's CD-ROM drive. [ citation needed ] \n Manufacturers of CD writers ( CD-R  or  CD-RW ) are encouraged by the music industry to ensure that every drive they produce has a unique identifier, which will be encoded by the drive on every disc that it records: the RID or Recorder Identification Code. [12]  This is a counterpart to the Source Identification Code (SID), an eight character code beginning with \" IFPI \" that is usually stamped on discs produced by CD recording plants. \n See also [ edit ] \n CD/DVD authoring \n Compact Disc Digital Audio \n Computer hardware \n DVD-Audio \n DVD-ROM \n Evolution of storage devices \n MultiLevel Recording \n Optical disc drive \n Phase-change Dual \n Thor-CD \n DVP Media , patent holder for self-loading and self configuring CD-ROM technology \n Notes [ edit ] \n ^   Note that the  CIRC  error correction system used in the CD audio format has two interleaved layers. \n ^   To three  significant figures . \n References [ edit ] \n ^  a   b   ISO (1995).  \"ISO/IEC 10149:1995 \u2013 Information technology \u2013 Data interchange on read-only 120 mm optical data disks (CD-ROM)\" .
