It predicts that the playback of prerecorded music will be regarded as a service rather than as individually sold products, and that the only system for the  digital distribution  of music that will be viable against piracy is a subscription-based system supporting  file sharing  and free of  digital rights management . The research also indicated that  US$ 9 per month for unlimited use would be the  market clearing  price at that time, but recommended $5 per month as the long-term optimal price. [1] \n Since its creation in 2002, a number of its principles have been adopted throughout the recording industry, [2]  and it has been cited as the basis for the business model of many  music subscription services . [3] [4] \n Contents \n 1   Overview \n 2   Industry adoption \n 3   See also \n 4   References \n Overview [ edit ] \n The model asserts that there are five  necessary  requirements for a viable commercial music digital distribution network: \n # \n Requirement \n Description \n 1 \n Open file sharing \n users must be free to  share files  with each other \n 2 \n Open file formats \n content must be distributed in open formats with no  DRM  restrictions \n 3 \n Open membership \n copyright  holders must be able to freely register to receive payment \n 4 \n Open payment \n payment should be accepted via multiple means, not a closed system \n 5 \n Open competition \n multiple such systems must exist which can interoperate, not a designed monopoly \n The model was proposed by  Shuman Ghosemajumder  in his 2002 research paper  Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models [1]  at the  MIT Sloan School of Management . The following year, it was publicly referred to as the Open Music Model. [5] \n The model suggests changing the way consumers interact with the digital property market: rather than being seen as a good to be purchased from online vendor, music would be treated as a service being provided by the industry, with firms based on the model serving as intermediaries between the music industry and its consumers. The model proposed giving consumers unlimited access to music for the price of  US$ 5 per month [1]  (as of 2002), based on research showing that this could be a long-term optimal price, expected to bring in a total revenue of over  US$ 3\u00a0billion per year. [1] \n The research demonstrated the demand for third-party file sharing programs. Insofar as the interest for a particular piece of digital property is high, and the risk of acquiring the good via illegitimate means is low, people will naturally flock towards third-party services such as  Napster  and Morpheus (more recently,  Bittorrent  and  The Pirate Bay ). [1] \n The research showed that consumers would use file sharing services not primarily due to cost but because of convenience, indicating that services which provided access to the most music would be the most successful. [1] \n Industry adoption [ edit ] \n The model predicted the failure of  online music distribution  systems based on  digital rights management . [5] [6] \n Criticisms of the model included that it would not eliminate the issue of piracy. [7]  Others countered that it was in fact the most viable solution to piracy, [8]  since piracy was \"inevitable\". [9]  Supporters argued that it offered a superior alternative to the current  law-enforcement based methods  used by the recording industry. [10]  One startup in Germany, Playment, announced plans to adapt the entire model to a commercial setting as the basis for its business model. [11] \n Several aspects of the model have been adopted by the recording industry and its partners over time: \n Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven't worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy. \n \u2013  Steve Jobs ,  Thoughts on Music [12]  open letter, 2007 \n The abolition of digital rights management represented a major shift for the industry. In 2007,  Steve Jobs , CEO of  Apple , published a letter [12]  calling for an end to DRM in music. A few months later,  Amazon.com  launched a store single individual DRM-free mp3's. [13]  One year later, iTunes Store abolished DRM on most of its individual tracks. [14] \n Open payment was relatively straightforward to implement, and the  iTunes Store  offered gift cards, which could be purchased with cash, from its launch in 2003. \n In 2010,  Rhapsody  announced a download ability [15]  for their subscribers using  iPhones . \n In 2011, Apple launched its  iTunes Match  service with a subscription model, supporting file-sharing between a user's own devices. [16]  However, the subscription price did not include the cost of acquiring content, which would still have to be purchased on a per track basis from the iTunes Store. \n Pricing close to the model's suggested $5 per month price, or its $9 per month market clearing price, has been adopted by many platforms:\n In 2005,  Yahoo! Music  was launched at $5 per month with  digital rights management . \n In 2011,  Spotify  introduced a $5 per month premium subscription in the United States with  digital rights management . [17] \n In 2011,  Microsoft   Zune  offered a subscription service for music downloads with  digital rights management  known as a  Zune Pass , at $10 a month. \n in 2012,  Google Play Music  launched unlimited music streaming for a subscription price of $9.99 per month. [18]  Users can upload their own MP3s to the service and download them, but cannot download songs they have not uploaded themselves. \n In 2014,  Amazon  added DRM music streaming to their Amazon Prime service. [19] \n In 2015, Apple announced  Apple Music , which would offer unlimited streaming of songs encrypted with  FairPlay  DRM for a subscription price of $9.99 per month, and compensate artists on the basis of song popularity. Apple reportedly wanted to enter the market with a lower price but was pressured by record labels to adopt a higher subscription fee.
