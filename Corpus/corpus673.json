The Washington Post  calls  Christianity Today,  \"evangelicalism's flagship magazine\"; [2]   The New York Times  describes it as a \"mainstream evangelical magazine\". [3] \n Christianity Today  magazine has a print circulation of approximately 118,000, of which approximately 36,000 is free, and readership of 260,000, [1]  as well as a website at ChristianityToday.com. [4]  The founder,  Billy Graham , stated that he wanted to \"plant the evangelical flag in the middle-of-the-road, taking the conservative theological position but a definite  liberal  approach to social problems\". [5]  Graham started the magazine as counterpoint to  The Christian Century , the predominant independent periodical of  mainline   Protestantism , and as a way to bring the evangelical Christian community together.

Neglected, slighted, misrepresented\u2014evangelical Christianity needs a clear voice, to speak with conviction and love, and to state its true position and its relevance to the world crisis. A generation has grown up unaware of the basic truths of the Christian faith taught in the Scriptures and expressed in the creeds of the historic evangelical churches.\" \n Its first editor was  Carl F. H. Henry . Notable contributors in its first two decades included  F. F. Bruce ,  Edward John Carnell ,  Frank Gaebelein ,  Walter Martin ,  John Warwick Montgomery , and  Harold Lindsell . Lindsell succeeded Henry as editor and during his editorial administration much attention centered on debates about  biblical inerrancy . Later editorial leadership came from Kenneth Kantzer, Terry Muck, and David Neff. The current editor is  Mark Galli , and the publication now includes print, online, and various ancillary products. Andy Olsen is managing editor of the print edition, and Richard Clark is managing editor of online journalism. Contents of print and online include feature stories, news ranging from cultural issues from a Christian viewpoint to the global church, opinion, reviews, and investigative reporting. \n In  Billy Graham \u2019s 1997 autobiography,  Just As I Am , he writes [8]  of his vision, idea, and history with Christianity Today and his early meeting with oil company executive,  John Howard Pew , to establish the publication. [9] \n Other magazines published by Christianity Today [ edit ] \n Harold Myra , who became president and chief executive of the magazine in 1975, believed that a \"family\" of magazines would disperse overhead expenses and give more stability to the organization. [10]  At the same time, he rejected expansion simply for expansion's sake, writing: \"our main concern was to make  Christianity Today , the flagship publication, fully effective in three basic areas: editorial, circulation, advertising. Anything which would drain off energies from the prime task was unthinkable.\" [11]  Christianity Today founded or acquired periodicals during the 1980s and 90s, beginning with  Leadership , a quarterly journal for clergy, in 1980. In 2005, Christianity Today International published 12 magazines, [12]  but following the  financial downturn of 2008  it was forced to shutter several publications. [13]  By 2017 that had further winnowed to three. [14] \n Leadership Journal  (1980\u20132016) [ edit ] \n The first \"sister publication\" added to the Christianity Today publishing group was  Leadership: A Practical Journal for Church Leaders , launched in 1980. The subtitle clearly defined the journal's mission: it was a quarterly publication, aimed primarily at clergy, and focusing on the practical concerns of ministry and church leadership. The first issue of  Leadership  sold out its initial press run of 50,000 copies, and the publication was in the black after a single issue. [15]  The journal continued in print for 36 years. After volume 37, issue 1 (winter 2016), Christianity Today discontinued the print publication, replacing it with expanded content in  Christianity Today  for pastors and church leaders and occasional print supplements, as well as a new website, CTPastors.com. [16] \n Campus Life/Ignite Your Faith  (1982\u20132009) [ edit ] \n Main article:  Ignite Your Faith \n In 1982, Christianity Today purchased the magazine  Campus Life,  aimed at a high school audience, from its parent organization,  Youth For Christ . The name of the magazine was changed to  Ignite Your Faith  in 2006. It ceased publication in 2009. \n Partnership/Marriage Partnership  (1984\u20132009) [ edit ] \n Partnership  was launched in 1984 [17]  as a magazine for wives of clergy. [10]  In 1987 [17]  it was renamed  Marriage Partnership  and expanded its focus to marriage in general, not just clergy marriages. The magazine ceased publication in 2009. \n Today's Christian Woman  (1985\u20132009) [ edit ] \n Today's Christian Woman  was founded in 1978 and acquired by Christianity Today from the  Fleming H. Revell Co.  in 1985. [18]  It discontinued print publication in 2009 and was replaced with a \"digizine\" called  Kyria , which was online only but still required a paid subscription to access, although at a lower price than the print magazine. [19]  In 2012 the name of the digital publication was changed back to  Today's Christian Woman , and in 2016 it stopped being issued as a regularly scheduled digital periodical. [20] \n Christian History  (1989\u20132008) [ edit ] \n Main article:  Christian History \n Christian History  was a journal of the history of Christianity, first issued in January 1982 by the Christian History Institute. Each issue had multiple articles covering a single theme. Initially published annually, it became a quarterly publication. Christianity Today took over ownership of the magazine beginning with issue number 22 in 1989; it was later discontinued after the publication of issue 99 in 2008. In 2011 the Christian History Institute resumed quarterly publication of the magazine.  Christian History  archives can still be found on ChristianityToday.com under its special section. [21] \n Christian Reader/Today's Christian  (1992\u20132008) [ edit ] \n Christian Reader , a digest magazine in the vein of  Reader's Digest ,  was founded in 1963 by  Tyndale House Publishers  founder  Ken Taylor . [22]  Christianity Today purchased the magazine in 1992. [17]  The name was changed to  Today's Christian  in 2004. [23]  In 2008, Christianity Today sold the magazine to the ministry Significant Living. [24] \n Books & Culture  (1995\u20132016) [ edit ] \n Main article:  Books & Culture \n Books & Culture  was a bimonthly book review and intellectual journal modeled after the  New York Review of Books  and  New York Times Book Review  published by Christianity Today International from 1995 to 2016. [25]  At the end of its publication life, the magazine's circulation was 11,000 and its readership was 20,000. [26]  It was edited by John Wilson, and notable contributors included  Mark Noll ,  Lauren Winner ,  Alan Jacobs ,  Jean Bethke Elshtain , and  Miroslav Volf . \n Virtue  (1998\u20132000) [ edit ] \n Virtue,  a magazine for Christian women, was founded in 1978. [27]  Christianity Today purchased the publication from  Cook Communications Ministries  in 1998 after that publisher abruptly closed the magazine. [28]  Christianity Today revived the magazine and continued publishing it for two more years before discontinuing publication following the December/January 2000 issue. [27] \n Christian Parenting Today  (1998\u20132005) [ edit ] \n Christian Parenting Today  (originally titled  Christian Parenting ) was founded in 1989. [29]  Christianity Today purchased the magazine from Cook Communications Ministries in 1998 in the same deal in which it acquired  Virtue . [28]  It ceased publication in 2005. [29] \n Men of Integrity  (1998\u2013present) [ edit ] \n Men of Integrity  is a bi-monthly magazine for Christian men published by Christianity Today. It was created in 1998 in partnership with the evangelical men's organization  Promise Keepers . [28] \n International editions (2007\u2013present) [ edit ] \n A  Portuguese-language  edition,  Christianity Today Brazil , was launched in October/November 2007. [30] [ not specific enough to verify ]  A  Korean-language  edition,  Christianity Today Korea , was launched in June 2008. [31] [ not specific enough to verify ]  Two international editions of  Leadership Journal  were launched in 2012: an African edition in September (English), and a Portuguese edition in October. [ citation needed ] \n Online presence [ edit ] \n The magazine's mission statement is to \"provide evangelical thought leaders a sense of community, coherence, and direction through thoughtful, biblical commentary on issues and through careful, caring reporting of the news.\" Its presence on the Internet began in October 1994 when it became one of the top 10 content providers on all of AOL. Then, in 1996, their website was launched. It was originally named ChristianityOnline.com before becoming ChristianityToday.com. Today ChristianityToday.com serves as the web home for  Christianity Today  magazine, which now has distinct sections for Local Church Pastors, [32]  Reporting,  [33]  Women, [34]  History,  [21]  and Spanish  [35]  readers. \n At the ministry's web home, ChristianityToday.org, all other brands for Christian thought leaders and church leaders are featured, including publications like the intellectual Christian review,  Books & Culture , and the website for pastors and church leaders,  CT Pastors . Additional web resources include  Men of Integrity  and  Preaching Today . Many of the brands published online under the  Christianity Today  banner are the online legacies of former print publications. \n All Christianity Today brands together reach more than 2.5 million people every month when print and digital views are combined, plus more than 5 million pageviews per month on the Internet. [36]  The ministry offers access, both premium and free, to over 100,000 articles and other content on their various websites. \n References [ edit ] \n ^  a   b   \"Christianity Today Advertising - Connecting You with Christian Audiences\" .  christianitytodayads.com .
