To this end, OSC staff are travelling across the province to deliver investor seminars about fraud awareness and to meet with local enterprises, including small businesses and start-up organizations, on access to capital issues. \n The  Protect Your Money  seminar provides Ontarians with resources and tips to protect against investment fraud. \n Updates on new and proposed capital raising rules  including prospectus exemptions offer greater clarity on how local enterprises, including small businesses and start-ups, can grow. \n Background \n In early 2013, the Ontario Securities Commission launched OSC in the Community, an outreach program which takes the OSC\u2019s regulatory mandate from Bay Street to Main Street. OSC staff are traveling to communities across Ontario to deliver investor seminars on fraud prevention and to meet with local businesses, government officials, law enforcement and other community organizations that are impacted by securities regulation in the province. \n Contact  | \n                                     Legal  |\n                                     Legislation  |\n                                     Accessibility  |\n                                     Fran\u00e7ais \n \u00a9 Ontario Securities Commission 2017 \n Government of Ontario \n JavaScript is disabled or not supported by this browser.
