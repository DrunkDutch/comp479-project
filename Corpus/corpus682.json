He is also known for playing the title roles in  Ivanhoe  and  The Scarlet Pimpernel  (both 1982), and for portraying  Prime Minister   Stanley Baldwin  in  The King's Speech  (2010). For his performance in  Brideshead Revisited  Andrews won a  Golden Globe  and  BAFTA  TV Award, as well as being nominated for an  Emmy . \n Contents \n 1   Life and career \n 2   Selected filmography \n 2.1   Film \n 2.2   Television \n 3   Producer \n 4   Theatrical roles \n 5   References \n 6   External links \n Life and career [ edit ] \n Andrews was born in  London , the son of Geraldine Agnes ( n\u00e9e  Cooper), a dancer, and Stanley Thomas Andrews, an arranger and conductor for the  BBC . [1]  He grew up in the  North Finchley  district of London. At the age of eight he undertook dancing lessons, making his stage debut as the  White Rabbit  in a stage adaptation of  Lewis Carroll 's  Alice in Wonderland . [2] \n After a series of short term \"fill-in\" jobs that included catering, farming and journalism, he secured a position at the  Chichester Theatre  where he worked as an assistant stage manager and later as a stand-in producer. He auditioned in 1968 for a production of  Alan Bennett 's new play,  Forty Years On , which featured  John Gielgud  as the headmaster of a  British public school  during the  First World War  period. Andrews was cast as Skinner, one of twenty schoolboys. \n In June 1977, he was cast in the role of  Bodie  in the  ITV  series  The Professionals . However, after three days of filming, the creator and producer  Brian Clemens  felt that the chemistry between Andrews and  Martin Shaw  ( Doyle ) did not work and that \"the pair did not have the required undercurrent of menace to carry off the concept\".  Lewis Collins  replaced Andrews in the part. [3]  Following that, in 1979, Andrews was the main star of the ITV television series  Danger UXB , in which he played a British bomb disposal officer in the  London Blitz . [4]  The series first aired in the United States in 1979 on  Masterpiece Theatre . \n His subsequent work includes the leading role of  Lord Sebastian Flyte  in  Brideshead Revisited . [4]  In 1982, he won a  Golden Globe  and  BAFTA  TV Award for his performance and was nominated for an  Emmy Award . In the United States, Andrews is best known for his portrayal of the titular character in  Ivanhoe  as well as that of Sir Percy Blakeney in the 1982 film  The Scarlet Pimpernel . [4] \n He played Professor Higgins in a stage version of  My Fair Lady  (2001), and Count Fosco in  Andrew Lloyd Webber's   The Woman in White . [5] \n He was the  narrator  for a 21st Anniversary  BBC Radio 2  special broadcast of  Cameron Mackintosh 's musical  Les Mis\u00e9rables , sung by the then  West End  cast at the  Mermaid Theatre  in  London  on Sunday 8 October 2006. Andrews appeared as Prime Minister  Stanley Baldwin  in the 2010 film  The King's Speech , for which he won a  SAG Award  along with  Helena Bonham Carter ,  Jennifer Ehle ,  Colin Firth ,  Michael Gambon ,  Derek Jacobi ,  Guy Pearce ,  Geoffrey Rush  and  Timothy Spall . \n Andrews survived a case of  water intoxication  in 2003. The condition, known as  hyponatraemia , is caused by the dilution of sodium in the body. It has similar symptoms to dehydration, such as headaches, nausea and cramps. Whilst performing as Henry Higgins in  My Fair Lady  he would consume up to eight litres of water a day. He lost consciousness and spent three days in intensive care. [6] \n He married Georgina Simpson of the  Simpsons of Piccadilly  department store family. Their daughter Amy is a god-daughter of  Princess Anne, The Princess Royal .
