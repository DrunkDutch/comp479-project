(December 2008)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n cDVD  discs, sometimes called  mini-DVD  discs as well, are regular  CDs  that contain  MPEG -video structured in accordance with the  DVD-Video  specifications (namely, a VIDEO_TS directory containing properly-authored IFO/BUP and VOB files). Such discs must be written in the so-called \" Mode 1 \", which is compatible with both the  ISO 9660  and  UDF  1.02 filesystems, and therefore limits the amount of data that can be stored on an 80-minute CD to 700 MB. By using non-standard resolutions, long  GOPs , more  B-frames , and high-compression  quantization matrices , it is possible to store up to 2 hours of video with audio and subtitles on a regular 80-minute CD. Until 2003, few standalone DVD-players had drives capable of spinning a CD at the 8X rate needed to keep up with the maximum data stream allowed by the DVD-Video specifications, but today, many models contain drives similar to those used on desktop computers, and more versatile  firmware  as well, so that the proper playback of compact DVDs is often supported, but rarely documented (especially in North America and Europe). \n See also [ edit ] \n Video CD  (VCD) \n CD Video  (CDV) \n Super Video CD  (SVCD) \n BD9 & BD5  - Blu-ray format video on DVDs \n MiniDVD  - 8\u00a0cm DVDs \n External links [ edit ] \n ViDEOHelp.com \n v \n t \n e \n DVD \n Discs \n DVD \n MiniDVD \n DVD card \n DVD-ROM \n DVD-RAM \n DVD-Audio \n DVD-Video \n DVD-R \n DVD-R DS \n DVD-R DL \n DVD-RW \n DVD+R \n DVD+R DS \n DVD+R DL \n DVD+RW \n Inkjet printable DVD \n Technology \n UDF \n DVD region code \n DVD copy protection \n CSS \n HDCP \n AACS \n DVD authoring \n DVD burning \n DVD ripping \n DVD recordable \n DVD program \n Anamorphic DVD \n DVD Video OBject \n DVD-VR \n DVD+VR \n DVD\u00b1R \n DVD Multi \n DVD writing speed \n DVD emulation \n DVD rot \n Groups \n DVD Forum \n DVD Copy Control Association \n DVD+RW Alliance \n DVD club \n Hardware/ \nSoftware/ \nContent\u00a0 \n DVD Case \n VCR/DVD combo \n DVD player \n Portable DVD player \n DVD recorder \n DVD drive \n External DVD \n DVD remote \n DVD ripper \n DVD game \n DVD single \n DVD magazine \n DVD documentary \n Straight to DVD \n Court cases \n DVD CCA v Bunner \n DVD CCA v Kaleidescape \n Real vs DVD CCA \n DeCSS \n Lists \n DVD manufacturers \n DVD recordable manufacturers \n DVD authoring software \n DVD burning software \n DVD copy protection schemes \n Variants \n cDVD \n SACD \n DualDisc \n EVD \n HVD \n FVD \n ML DVD \n HD/DVD \n 3\u00d7 DVD \n BD5 \n BD9 \n Nintendo disc \n Digital Video Express  (DIVX) \n DVD-D \n See also \n HD DVD \n Blu-ray \n LaserDisc \n CD Video \n Compact disc \n VCD \n SVCD \n CD-DA \n CD-ROM \n   Category \n   WikiCommons \n   Wiktionary \n This  computer-storage -related article is a  stub .
