It\u2019s extremely unprofessional,\u201d said Peluso.  \n Bob Sonin, president of the Graduate Students\u2019 Association and VP Bargaining for the Teaching and Research Assistants of Concordia, agreed.  \n \u201cThey delay and delay and delay. It\u2019s become a joke that they delay one union because they\u2019re too busy delaying the other unions.\u201d \n \u201cDelay and Delay and Delay\u201d \n \u201cWe have the distinction of having the largest period of negotiations,\u201d Peluso noted wryly. But many other unions have similar stories.  \n Almost three years after their collective agreement expired, the Concordia University Library Employees Union is still negotiating with the university.  CULEU  deposited their demands in January 2010, but negotiations have been moving slowly since then, explained union president Irene Fernandez.  \n \u201cWe\u2019d like to do this in six months, a year, max. And we said that when we made the deposit. We said it the last time we negotiated. This institution just isn\u2019t moving,\u201d she said.  \n \u201cWe\u2019re told by our technical advisers [from the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux] that nowhere else do negotiations take as long as they do at Concordia. But we\u2019re told by Concordia, \u2018Well, you know Concordia; this is how long it takes here.\u2019\u201d \n Concordia\u2019s 96 maintenance workers are in a similar situation. Represented by the United Steelworkers Local 9538, they have been embroiled in an acrimonious and much-publicized dispute with the university for years.  \n Workers at the downtown campus have been without a collective agreement since June 2008, and their colleagues at Loyola haven\u2019t had one since June 2009. \n \u201cWe\u2019ve been at it since 2009, and [Concordia] couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d said Eddie Ginocchi, vice-president of the  USW  Local 9538. Ginocchi said his members are underpaid and need more staff to keep up with an increasing workload, but the university has so far refused to consider the union\u2019s demands.  \n \u201cWe haven\u2019t ever seen such long negotiations,\u201d said  USW  Quebec spokesperson Clairandr\u00e9e Cauchy. \n The Concordia University Faculty Association\u2019s current collective agreement won\u2019t run out until this May. But their last agreement took two years to negotiate, and they\u2019re already predicting that this round, which began in November 2011, could be just as lengthy.  \n \u201cYour guess is as good as mine. More than four months have passed and we have not signed a single article that we have agreed on,\u201d explained Ian Rakita, CUFA\u2019s chief negotiator. They still have more than two dozen issues to discuss, he said. \u201cAt the rate we\u2019re going, it could very well take two years plus. We\u2019re not at all happy with that.\u201d \n The Link contacted Concordia two weeks prior to publication to ask for a comment. Concordia Associate VP Human Resources Carolina Willsher told\u00a0The Link\u00a0that the university was negotiating with several unions and that \u201cnegotiations are proceeding well.\u201d \n Willsher referred The Link to Concordia\u2019s website and Frequently Asked Questions section for more information. Further interview requests were directed to the university\u2019s media relations, but were not returned by press time. \n More Delays \n Unless any major breakthroughs are made, all but two of Concordia\u2019s unions will be negotiating with the university by this August. This backlog won\u2019t speed up the already-slow bargaining process, said Sonin.  \n \u201cYou just get fed into the hopper. So if it\u2019s a first-come, first-served kind of thing, [admin] can always say, \u2018This other union here, they\u2019ve been negotiating for five years.\u2019\u201d \n It\u2019s not an encouraging sign for unions like  TRAC  who have yet to begin their negotiations.  \n \u201cI don\u2019t really have any confidence that the university will do anything but delay,\u201d said Sonin. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve done with all the other unions.\u201d \n Fernandez noted that her colleagues in the Concordia University Professional Employees Union had even considered holding off negotiations because of the backlog.  \n CUPEU  could not be reached for comment, but Fernandez explained that \u201cthey knew everybody else was negotiating, so what time would they get? And they don\u2019t want to spend two, three, four, five years negotiating.\u201d  \n To avoid delaying their negotiations,  CUFA  offered to set aside all non-monetary demands. Their previous collective agreement wasn\u2019t \u201call that bad\u201d according to Rakita, so the union was prepared to leave it as-is.  \n \u201cWe really need to focus on what is really important,\u201d he explained, adding that Concordia Provost David Graham, who was present for initial discussions with  CUFA , had expressed support for the idea. But the university\u2019s negotiation team has been less interested, instead insisting on \u201cthe change of a word here, a word there, wording that has been present for many agreements.\u201d \n \u201cChange for the sake of change\u201d was the university\u2019s response when asked why these issues were only being raised now, Rakita said.  \n Other unions noted that such long negotiations meant that they often had to restart discussions or go over the same issues again.  \n \u201cWe saw four different university presidents, three different directors of human resources,\u201d said Peluso. And the university\u2019s negotiators also keep changing, according to several union reps.  \n \u201cThere\u2019s always new people, so most people find themselves training the very people they\u2019re negotiating with,\u201d Peluso said.  \n CULEU  is also dealing with a new negotiator and there\u2019s been a significant learning curve. \u201cSomeone who has just come in will not know the culture and how things are done here,\u201d said Fernandez. \n Toil and Toilets \n \u201cThe money is the main demand,\u201d Ginocchi explained.  \n \u201cThe university has the same old story: there is no money and we can\u2019t pay [\u2026] Yet we see plenty of money being thrown out the window,\u201d he said, referencing the millions of dollars Concordia has spent on severance packages for departing senior administrators in recent years. \n Graphic Vivien Leung \n He also noted that in 2010 the university gave a 2.5 per cent raise to senior administrators, whose average salary\u2014not including benefits\u2014is almost $200,000. The university hasn\u2019t been so generous with the unions, Ginocchi said.  \n \u201cWell, we can\u2019t have it. We\u2019re not allowed.\u201d \n CULEU  has asked for a two per cent wage increase, plus cost-of-living adjustments.  \n \u201cThings have gone up tremendously cost-wise, from bus fares to gas to whatever, and our salaries have not gone up in the past three years at all,\u201d explained Fernandez. \n It\u2019s been five years since the Steelworkers had a raise, and the university hasn\u2019t budged on salaries during the current negotiations, Ginocchi said.  \n \u201c\u2018This is all we have to give you. This is all we have to give you. This is all we have to give you.\u2019 No matter how many examples we bring in, \u2018This is all we have to give you.\u2019\u201d \n In the meantime, the university campus has grown hugely, and his members can\u2019t keep up with the work.  \n \u201cWe do pride ourselves. We do want to work hard. We strive to do our best,\u201d he said. \u201cBut [we\u2019re told,] \u2018You\u2019re being paid for the thirty-eight-and-three-quarter hours\u2014if the toilets are broken today, screw it! Do it tomorrow!\u2019 But we don\u2019t do that, because we have the students at heart.\u201d \n Hiring more maintenance workers would help, but it\u2019s difficult to find people because qualified workers can usually earn more elsewhere. A unionized electrician making $23 per hour at Concordia would be paid about $34 per hour for the same job at Bombardier, Ginocchi said. \n The university has so far refused to compare the Steelworkers\u2019 wages to their colleagues\u2019 wages at other universities.  \n \u201cWhen McGill\u2019s tradespeople got a certain amount, [admin] told us, \u2018Well, they\u2019re gonna go broke, because they cannot afford to pay that much,\u2019\u201d Ginocchi recalled.  \n He noted that the McGill maintenance workers now report to Concordia\u2019s former VP Services, Michael Di Grappa. \u201cWell hang on, Di Grappa found the goddamned paper, and he was our boss before!\u201d \n \u201cThere\u2019s No Respect\u201d \n Shortly before the Steelworkers left the table after years of unproductive bargaining, the workers\u2019 representative \u201cused colourful language toward the spokesperson at the university,\u201d Ginocchi remembered.  \n \u201cI removed myself from the negotiation table,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it gets to the point that they aggravate you, they drive you crazy, you want to jump over the table and use your fists.\u201d \n Many other union reps stressed the need for a more conciliatory, less adversarial approach to negotiations.  CULEU  tried interest-based bargaining\u2014which encourages parties to present broad interests, rather than demands, in order to find a win-win solution\u2014but quit in November 2011 after the provincially-appointed conciliator decided the sessions weren\u2019t going anywhere. \n \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate on interest-based bargaining and have Joseph Stalin across the table,\u201d said one union representative. The tone in the Steelworkers\u2019 negotiations has been similarly difficult, according to Ginocchi.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point that no matter what we say, they have a stone face, they couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no respect.\u201d \n Radicalization \n Many union representatives claimed that the less-than-amicable tone and slow pace of negotiations have pushed them to consider other options, including striking. \n The Steelworkers were supposed to meet with the university on March 30, but that meeting has since been pushed back to April 17. Ginocchi expressed hope that they will make some progress at the next meeting, but the union still has a strike mandate and could stop work if things don\u2019t go well.  \n \u201cWe have to make a decision\u2014either we go ahead or we blow up again,\u201d he said, alluding to his union\u2019s one-day strike in September 2011. \n It took rotating strikes to break the stalemate in CUPFA\u2019s seven-year-long negotiations. An agreement was finally signed, but the bitter dispute didn\u2019t help employee-employer relations.  \n \u201cIt simply cemented our resolve, that\u2019s one thing that it did, which I don\u2019t think is very productive,\u201d said Peluso. \n \u201cNegotiations lasting over two years are definitely the exception in Canada, not the rule. And we don\u2019t want to follow that tradition,\u201d explained Rakita.  \n At other universities, he noted, some faculty associations take a strike vote before negotiations begin, in case discussions drag for too long.  \n \u201cMaybe something like that does force the hand of administrations to come to a conclusion in short order, rather than to talk for years on end.\u201d \n CULEU  is facing similar problems.  \n \u201cThere will come a time when people will be fed up, and\u2026 who knows?\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that doesn\u2019t happen [\u2026] I\u2019d like to be able to reason and do things in a normal fashion, because there\u2019s nothing in our demands that\u2019s astronomically different.\u201d  \n But after almost three years, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult.  \n \u201cI keep hearing now, every time I see someone, \u2018Do we have an agreement, do we have an agreement?\u2019 What can I say?\u201d \n Validation \n \u201cA collective agreement should be implemented. It\u2019s not a contract that\u2019s either/or, but a contract of mutual agreement. There should be harmony. That\u2019s not the case with any of them,\u201d said Peluso.  \n Ideally, she said, a collective agreement should be positive.  \n \u201cYou\u2019ve arrived at an understanding. Inevitably conflict will always be there, but it should be minimal, it shouldn\u2019t be a chronic pattern.\u201d \n \u201cCertainly we feel that the salary and benefits that we pay to all of our employees are fair and comparable to other universities and similar institutions,\u201d Concordia\u2019s VP institutional Relations Bram Freedman told The Link in November.  \n \u201cWe feel that employees are paid comparably [and] we feel that administrators are paid comparably.\u201d \n But the issue isn\u2019t specific demands, Peluso explained.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Okay, what is it the library workers want, and what do the maintenance workers want, and what do I want?\u2019 I can give you a list\u2014we can all give you a list\u2014but there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with how Concordia handles labour relations. \n \u201cAn employer should be validating their employees. There are great people at Concordia. Great secretaries, labour workers, teachers, maintenance workers, professionals, managers.  \n \u201cThere are really great people. That\u2019s the soul of the community. We make it happen. So you should be validating these people. None of us feel validated.\u201d \n By commenting on this page you agree to the terms of our  Comments Policy . \n Please enable JavaScript to view the  comments powered by Disqus. \n Related Reading \n News \n Obstructing or Disrupting \n Corey Pool \n News \n Anti-Austerity: A Non-United Front? \n Noelle Didierjean \n News \n CSU Off The Hook \n Corey Pool \n Opinions \n Could an Illegal Drug Change the Way We Treat Psychological Trauma? \n Gonzo Nieto \n Most Popular \n La Meute and Storm Alliance Rally to Take Place Nov. 25 \n News  \u2013 11/17/17 \n Kunlun 3, Montreal 1: Les Canadiennes Face First Defeat at the Hands of the Red Star \n Sports  \u2013 11/12/17 \n Concordia Senate Denounces Bill 62 \n News  \u2013 11/13/17 \n Thousands March Against Racism in Montreal \n News  \u2013 11/12/17 \n Concordia University Warns Students of Dangerous Social Media Campaign \n News  \u2013 11/13/17 \n Current Issue \n Volume 38, Issue 3 November 7th, 2017 \n Download PDF \n Podcast \n Archives \n About Us \n Advertise \n Contribute \n RSS \n All content \u00a9 2017 The Link Publication Society Inc.
