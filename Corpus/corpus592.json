There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent. \n Independents may support policies which are different from those of the major political parties. \n In some parts of the world electors may have a tradition of electing independents, so standing for a political party is a disadvantage. \n In some countries (including  Russia ) a political party can only be registered if it has a large number of members in more than one region, but in certain regions only a minority of electors support the major parties. \n In some countries (including  Kuwait ), political parties are  unlawful  and all candidates thus stand as independents. [1] \n In some countries where politics is otherwise traditionally partisan, such as the  United States , subnational bodies and offices such as the  Nebraska State Legislature  and various directly-elected judicial and executive positions are nonpartisan, and require politicians to abstain from running for office as part of a political party, even if they may be a member of one. \n In some countries where politics is otherwise traditionally partisan, such as  Mongolia , the incumbent President must always be an independent, and cannot run for reelection as a member of a political party. \n Some independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level. \n In running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word \"independent\" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the \"independent\" candidates. \n Contents \n 1   Australia \n 2   Brazil \n 3   Bulgaria \n 4   Canada \n 5   Croatia \n 6   France \n 7   Germany \n 8   Hong Kong \n 9   Iceland \n 10   India \n 11   Ireland \n 12   Italy \n 13   Kosovo \n 14   Malaysia \n 15   Mexico \n 16   New Zealand \n 17   Niue \n 18   Pakistan \n 19   Philippines \n 20   Poland \n 21   Russia \n 22   Taiwan \n 23   United Kingdom \n 23.1   House of Commons \n 23.2   House of Lords \n 23.3   Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, Northern Irish Assembly \n 23.4   Local elections \n 24   United States \n 24.1   President \n 24.2   Governor \n 24.3   Congress - House of Representatives and Senate \n 24.4   State and local offices \n 25   See also \n 26   Notes and references \n 27   External links \n Australia [ edit ] \n Main article:  Independent politicians in Australia \n Independents are a recurrent feature of the federal  Parliament of Australia , and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up time five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large number of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the  Australian Labor Party , the  Liberal Party of Australia , the  Australian Greens , or the  National Party of Australia . In 2013 a political party named the  Australian Independents  was registered with the  Australian Electoral Commission . [2] \n As at 2017 two independents sit in the  Australian House of Representatives ,  Andrew Wilkie  from  Denison  in  Tasmania  (former  Greens  candidate) and  Cathy McGowan  from  Indi  in  Victoria . \n Independent  Senators  are quite rare. In modern politics, independent  Brian Harradine  served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times.  Nick Xenophon  has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the  2007 federal election . Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the  2013 federal election . [3]   DLP  Senator  John Madigan  became an independent Senator in September 2014, [4]  while  PUP  Senators  Jacqui Lambie  and  Glenn Lazarus  became independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015. [5] [6] \n Brazil [ edit ] \n The independent politicians are not allowed to run for offices in Brazil. The Constitution of 1988, in its Article 14, \u00a73rd, item V, says that \"Are conditions for elegibility: V - party affiliation.\" [7]  However, the Proposal Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) no. 6/2015, authored by senator  Jos\u00e9 Reguffe , would allow the independent candidacy of individuals who have the support of at least 1% of the electors able to vote in the region (city, state or country, depending on the election) in which the candidate is running. [8] [9]  Currently, members of the legislative and executive can leave their respective parties after elected, as is the case of senator Reguffe, who left the  Democratic Labour Party  (PDT) in 2016. [10] \n Bulgaria [ edit ] \n The  President of Bulgaria   Rumen Radev  is an independent with support from the  Bulgarian Socialist Party . Radev was elected in the  Bulgarian presidential election of 2016 . \n Canada [ edit ] \n See also:  Independent Liberal  and  Independent Conservative \n Independent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of  Independent Liberal  or  Independent Conservative  MPs into the 1950s. \n Independent politicians have held considerable sway in the  Canadian House of Commons  in recent years as Canada has been governed by successive  minority governments  with independent  Members of Parliament  (MPs) sometimes sharing in the  balance of power . \n In the  2004 federal election ,  Chuck Cadman  was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the  British Columbia   riding  of  Surrey North . Cadman had previously represented that riding on behalf of the  Reform Party of Canada  and  Canadian Alliance , but after the Canadian Alliance merged with the  Progressive Conservative Party of Canada  to form the new  Conservative Party of Canada  in 2003, Cadman lost the nomination to represent the Conservative Party in that riding to  Jasbir Singh Cheema . Cadman then stood in the subsequent election as an independent and defeated Cheema, as well as the candidates of other Canadian parties, by a significant margin. \n In the spring of 2005, Cadman cast the tying vote in favour of a budget supported by the  Liberal Party  government of  Paul Martin  as well as the  New Democratic Party  (NDP), but opposed by the opposition Conservatives and  Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois . Two other independents also voted on that budget.  Carolyn Parrish , independent MP for  Mississauga\u2014Erindale , had recently been kicked out of the Liberal Party for criticizing US president George W Bush, but nonetheless sided with the Liberals on the budget vote.  David Kilgour  independent MP for  Edmonton\u2014Mill Woods\u2014Beaumont , had previously quit the Liberal caucus and voted with the opposition parties against the budget. The tie vote required the  Speaker of the House   Peter Milliken  to cast the deciding vote, and he did so in favor of the budget, allowing the government to survive. \n Cadman was terminally ill with  cancer  at the time he cast his crucial vote, and he died later in 2005. In the  2006 federal election , his riding was won by NDP candidate  Penny Priddy . Neither Parrish nor Kilgour (nor  Pat O'Brien , MP for  London\u2014Fanshawe , who quit the Liberal Party to sit as an independent after the 2005 budget vote) stood for re-election in 2006. \n Another independent candidate,  Andr\u00e9 Arthur , was elected in the  Quebec  riding of  Portneuf\u2014Jacques-Cartier  in 2006, and was the only independent to win a seat in that election. He was re-elected in the  October 14, 2008 federal election . Former  Progressive Conservative  and  Conservative  MP  Bill Casey , who was expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 Federal Budget, also ran as an independent in the 2008 election, easily retaining his seat. \n Candidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with \"Independent\" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent. \n The territorial legislatures of the  Northwest Territories  and  Nunavut  are  consensus governments  with no political parties, so that all members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other subnational legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the  2009 election  in  British Columbia , independent candidate  Vicki Huntington  narrowly defeated incumbent  Attorney General   Wally Oppal  as MLA for  Delta South . \n True independents should not be confused with members of parties without  official party status  in a legislature. Most legislatures provide that a party must hold a certain number of seats to enjoy certain advantages in staffing, budget, ability to ask questions in  Question Period , and the like. Although members whose parties do not hold this status may have no more privileges than independent members, they remain representatives of political parties. \n Also, members who are expelled from or choose to leave their party caucus may sit as \"Independent\" with some designation, e.g., \"Independent Liberal\" or \"Independent Conservative\", to indicate their affiliation to that party even if it is not officially recognized. \n Election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties. \n Croatia [ edit ] \n After an inconclusive election in  2015   Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107  was named the first non-partisan  Prime Minister of Croatia . \n France [ edit ] \n In France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as  sans \u00e9tiquette  (\"without label\") in municipal or district elections. However, it is rare to have independent politicians at national level, e.g.  Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9  in the 2007 presidential election.  Emmanuel Macron  was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2017 presidential election. \n In 1920,  Alexandre Millerand  was elected  president of the Republic  under the banner \"without label\". \n From 2001 to 2008 \"without label\" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the  Ministry of the Interior . Candidates and lists presenting themselves as \"without label\" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the \"miscellaneous\" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming No political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition. [11] \n Germany [ edit ] \n Joachim Gauck ,  President of Germany  from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent Independent politician. In the  German presidential election of 2010  he was the candidate of the  Social Democrats  and  Greens , in  2012  the candidate of all major parties except  The Left . His presidency\u2014though his powers are limited\u2014constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since  World War II . It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the  Federal Convention  was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer  Luise Rinser . \n In the  Bundestag  parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of  personalized proportional representation  (since 1949) allows any individual holding the  passive right to vote  to stand for a direct  mandate  in the  electoral districts \u2014half of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a  plurality voting system . Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first  Bundestag election in 1949  saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat. [12]  At  state  level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a  Landtag  legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in  local elections  it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to  districts ', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a  city council  or even  mayor , especially in  Northern Germany . In recent years, independents have formed  Free Voters  associations to enter Landtag parliaments, so far only successful in  Bavaria . \n An independent  MP , who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of a  non-inscrit  ( German :  fraktionsloser Abgeordneter ) not affiliated to any  parliamentary group . A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes an independent and  non-inscrit . In 1989 the Bundestag MP  Thomas W\u00fcppesahl , who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a non-inscrit, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the  Federal Constitutional Court  decided partially in his favor. \n After the  German unification  of 1871, the first  Reich Chancellors  ( heads of government )  de jure  served as  executive officers  of the  German Imperial states  as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the  Weimar  period after  World War I , several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were  Wilhelm Cuno  (1922\u20131923),  Hans Luther  (1925\u20131926), the former  Centre  politician  Franz von Papen  (1932), and  Kurt von Schleicher  (1932\u20131933). The last two  cabinets  appointed by Reich President  Paul von Hindenburg , a non-partisan (though strongly  Conservative ) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the  Nazi Party ; many of the ministers were not party members. \n Since World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though \"on the ticket\" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister  Hans Leussink  (1969\u20131972), and Minister of Economy  Werner M\u00fcller  (1998\u20132002). Minister of Justice  Klaus Kinkel  only shortly after his appointment joined the  Free Democrats  in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor  Ludwig Erhard , whose affiliation with the  Christian Democratic Union  (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU  party chairman  in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by  Der Stern  magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949. [13] \n Hong Kong [ edit ] \n More than half of Hong Kong's  Legislative Council  is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in  functional constituencies , and are not rare among  geographical constituencies . \n Iceland [ edit ] \n The  President of Iceland  (currently  Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson ) is independent. \n India [ edit ] \n Independent candidate contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party. Some are also run as independent candidates after being sidelined by political rivals within their own party, or to ensure that a rival candidate is not elected. While some are genuine candidates, others have been criticised as dummy candidates put forward by political parties to get around the spending ceiling imposed by the  Election Commission , or to confuse voters by using party names similar to those of another candidate. [ citation needed ] \n Ireland [ edit ] \n After the  Irish general election in 2016 , there were 19 independent  TDs  (Members of Parliament) in the  D\u00e1il  (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. 4 TDs also sit for a registered party called  Independents4Change . A grouping of independents, the  Independent Alliance  has agreed to support the minority Government with a number of other individual independents similarly agreeing and receiving cabinet positions. \n There are fourteen independent senators in the  25th   Seanad  (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the  National University of Ireland  and two from  Dublin University . There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the  Taoiseach  and four elected by the technical panels. \n Both of these are record highs for independents \n Italy [ edit ] \n The Prime Ministers  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi  (1993 - 1994),  Lamberto Dini  (1995 - 1996),  Giuliano Amato  (2000 - 2001), and  Mario Monti  (2011 - 2013) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the  President of the Italian Republic  between 1999 and 2006. \n Kosovo [ edit ] \n In  Kosovo , [a]   Atifete Jahjaga  was elected the first female and Independent  President  of Kosovo. She was also the first female and independent elected leader in the whole of the  Balkans . \n Malaysia [ edit ] \n Independents have rarely been elected to the  Dewan Rakyat  and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent  Senators  are quite rare. \n As of 2017, one independent politician sits in the  Dewan Rakyat ,  Abdul Khalid Ibrahim  from  Bandar Tun Razak , the constituency with the highest registered voters in  Kuala Lumpur  (former  PKR  candidate). \n Mexico [ edit ] \n Jaime Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n  (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname \"El Bronco\", is a  Mexican  politician who is the current governor for the northern state of  Nuevo Le\u00f3n  and holds no political party affiliation. As of June 7, 2015 elected Governor for Nuevo Le\u00f3n, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country. \n New Zealand [ edit ] \n Originally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since  1943 , although two independent candidates have been successful in  by-elections  (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such. \n The last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was  Winston Peters , who won the  1993 by-election  in  Tauranga  electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the  National Party . By the time of the  next general election , he had formed his own party ( New Zealand First ), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success \u2014 examples include  Peter Dunne ,  Taito Phillip Field ,  Gordon Copeland ,  Tau Henare , and  Alamein Kopu . Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as  Frank Grover  and  Tuariki Delamere . \n There were two independent MPs in the  last Parliament ;  Chris Carter  and  Hone Harawira . Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the  Labour Party 's leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the  M\u0101ori Party  and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the  2011 by-election  when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party,  Mana  and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There are also two parties other which have only a single MP  United Future  with  Peter Dunne  and  ACT  with  David Seymour . Neither Dunne nor Seymour are classed as independents \u2014 Dunne's presence in Parliament is due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence is as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the  2011 election . In the  50th New Zealand Parliament  there was one independent MP:  Brendan Horan , a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets. \n Peter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered. \n Niue [ edit ] \n In  Niue , there have been no political parties since 2003, when the  Niue People's Party  disbanded, and all politicians are  de facto  independents. The government depends on an informal coalition. \n Pakistan [ edit ] \n Pakistan  is a Democratic country and also has Independent politician standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has  General Elections, 2008  Elected 30 Members. In Election 2011 has won the 4 candidates in National Assembly.In General Election 2013, 9 seats won by independents. \n Philippines [ edit ] \n Noli de Castro , the  Philippines ' former  vice president ,  ran as senator  in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition  Pwersa ng Masa coalition  but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran  as vice president  as a guest candidate of the administration  K-4 coalition  and won with just under majority of the vote. \n Starting in 2001, several  senators  had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the  15th Congress , there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the  2007 Senate election  when  Gregorio Honasan  (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier  elected in 1995  as an independent candidate and being adopted by the  Nationalist People's Coalition -led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since  Magnolia Antonino  in  1967 , although Antonino was a guest candidate of the  Liberal Party  then. \n In the local level, former priest  Eddie Panlilio  was elected as governor of  Pampanga  in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated. \n In the  2010 House of Representatives elections , seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections. \n In contesting elections, independent candidates are required by law to spend less than candidates nominated by a party. \n Poland [ edit ] \n The  Polish   Sejm  is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan  Voters' Electoral Committee  (pol.  KWW ,  komitet wyborczy wyborc\u00f3w ); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g.  Kukiz'15 , or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like  German Minority Electoral Committee , represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents. \n Tickets like  Civic Platform  during the  2001 election  were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now. \n The situation in the  Senate  is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election ( 2015 ) four independents won seats in the Senate. \n Three  Presidents  since 1990 have technically been independents.  Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa  was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the  Solidarity  and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and  Prime Minister   Tadeusz Mazowiecki ).  Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski  was a leader of the  Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland , but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did  Lech Kaczy\u0144ski , who was the first leader of  Law and Justice ,  Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski  ( PO ) and  Andrzej Duda  ( PiS ). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions. [14]  The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party). \n Russia [ edit ] \n All of Russia's  Presidents  have been independents. Former president  Dmitry Medvedev  declined an offer to join  United Russia , saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party. \n Vladimir Putin , the current president of Russia, is the head of the  United Russia  party, but is not its member, thus formally is independent. \n Taiwan [ edit ] \n After the last  local election  in  Taiwan  on 29 November 2014, there are three independent local heads, which are: \n Chen Fu-hai ,  Magistrate  of  Kinmen County \n Fu Kun-chi ,  Magistrate  of  Hualien County \n Ko Wen-je ,  Mayor  of  Taipei City \n United Kingdom [ edit ] \n The  Registration of Political Parties Act 1998  laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the  Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 . Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent  annibynol ) or no ballot paper description at all [15] [16]  (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the  Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008 ). \n Some groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the  Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern , the  Epsom and Ewell Residents Association , the  Devizes Guardians , the  Derwentside Independents , and the East Yorkshire Independents. [17] \n House of Commons [ edit ] \n See also:  List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected \n Before the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the  House of Commons of the United Kingdom , but there have been very few since 1945. \n S. O. Davies , the veteran  Labour  MP held his  Merthyr Tydfil  seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party. \n The journalist  Martin Bell  was elected at  Tatton  in the  General Election of 1997 , having stood on an anti-corruption platform. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951. [18]  He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001. \n At the  2001 General Election ,  Dr Richard Taylor  of the  Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern  party was elected for the constituency of  Wyre Forest . \n Two independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the  2005 election , although both were defeated five years later. \n At the same General Election,  Peter Law  was elected as an independent at  Blaenau Gwent . Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting  by-election  elected  Dai Davies  of the local party  Blaenau Gwent People's Voice . The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent. \n Also at the  2005 General Election  Richard Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest. This was notable for the fact that he was the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term. \n Only one independent was elected to the Commons in the  2010 ,  2015  and  2017 elections ,  Sylvia Hermon , the Member for  North Down , a  Unionist  who left the  Ulster Unionist Party  because of its links with the  Conservatives . \n There have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included  Mike Hancock  (formerly a Liberal Democrat),  Eric Joyce  (formerly Labour) and  Nadine Dorries , a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time. \n Independent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without success. An example from the  2001 general election  was  Aston Villa  supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the  Sutton Coldfield constituency  in protest at the way chairman  Doug Ellis  ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the  Salisbury constituency , is  Arthur Uther Pendragon , a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of  King Arthur . \n Other independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the  Labour Party  but before the  Respect Coalition  was founded, British  Member of Parliament  (MP)  George Galloway  described himself as \"Independent Labour\". \n On 23 March 2005 the  Independent Network  was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election. [19]  The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic [ clarification needed ]  set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to  Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life . The Independent Network does not impose any  ideology  or political influence on their candidates. \n In March 2009, the multi-millionaire  Sir Paul Judge  established the  Jury Team , an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections. [20] \n House of Lords [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Crossbencher ,  Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords , and  Lords Spiritual \n The  House of Lords  includes a large number of peers independent from political parties. Some are simply  not affiliated  with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of  crossbenchers . Additionally the  Lords Spiritual  (bishops of the  Church of England ) do not have party affiliations. \n Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, Northern Irish Assembly [ edit ] \n In the  2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections , three  MSPs  were elected as Independents:  Dennis Canavan  ( Falkirk West ),  Dr Jean Turner  ( Strathkelvin and Bearsden ) and  Margo MacDonald  ( Lothians ). In 2004  Campbell Martin  ( West of Scotland region ) left the  Scottish National Party  to become an independent and in 2005  Brian Monteith  ( Mid Scotland and Fife ) left the  Conservative Party  to become an independent. At the  2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections  Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time  four years later . She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the  2016 election . [21] \n Peter Law  was expelled from the  Labour Party  after standing against an official Labour candidate in  Blaenau Gwent  at the 2005 UK general election and became an independent in the National Assembly and UK Parliament. In 2006 Peter Law died from a  brain tumour  and his wife,  Trish Law  campaigned and took the seat as an independent candidate at the sequent by-election and held onto the seat again in the  2007 Welsh Assembly elections . \n In 2016,  Nathan Gill  as the then leader of UKIP Wales defected from the group to sit as an independent after a falling out with  Neil Hamiliton  who was elected UKIP Assembly group leader. Lord  Dafydd Elis-Thomas  left the  Plaid Cymru  group later in 2016 after multiple fallings out with Plaid Cymru leader  Leanne Wood . Dafydd Elis-Thomas said his reason for leaving Plaid Cymru was that it not serious about working with the  Welsh Labour  Government. [Neil McEvoy]] Was suspended from Plaid Cymru on 19 September 2017 [22]  and is not sitting as an independent AM. [23] \n Local elections [ edit ] \n The introduction of  directly elected mayors  in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in  Stoke-on-Trent ,  Middlesbrough ,  Bedford ,  Hartlepool  and  Mansfield . The first  Mayor of London ,  Ken Livingstone , was  first elected  as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate  Frank Dobson . He was subsequently re-admitted to the  Labour Party  in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign. \n Independent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the  Local Government Association  to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the  City of London Corporation , the  Isles of Scilly Council , and  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar  (Western Isles Council) in the  Outer Hebrides . \n Roughly a quarter of the  police and crime commissioners  elected in England and Wales in the  2012 election  were independents. [24] \n United States [ edit ] \n See also:  Third party officeholders in the United States \n President [ edit ] \n George Washington  was the only president elected as an independent, as he was not formally affiliated with any party during his term in office. \n John Tyler  was expelled from the  Whig Party  in September 1841, and remained effectively an independent for the remainder of his presidency, later returning to the  Democrats . He briefly sought re-election in  1844  as a National Democrat, but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote. \n Since 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included Republican Congressman  John Anderson  in  1980 ,  Ross Perot  in  1992 , former  Green Party  candidate  Ralph Nader  in the  2004  and  2008  elections, and  Bernie Sanders  (though on the Democratic ticket) in the  2016  election. \n In 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in  New Mexico ,  Delaware , and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for Federal races, including  Joe Lieberman  ( Connecticut for Lieberman ). \n Governor [ edit ] \n Illinois ,  Maine ,  Oregon ,  Rhode Island ,  Texas ,  Alaska  and  Minnesota  have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors,  Shadrach Bond  and  Edward Coles ;  James B. Longley  in 1974 as well as  Angus King  in 1994 and 1998 from Maine;  Lincoln Chafee  in 2010 from Rhode Island;  Julius Meier  in 1930 from Oregon;  Sam Houston  in 1859 from Texas; and  Bill Walker  in 2014 from Alaska.  Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.  is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as  A Connecticut Party  candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees. Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is  Jesse Ventura , who actually ran as a member of the  Reform Party's  Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the  Independence Party of Minnesota . \n In 1971, State Senator  Henry Howell  of  Virginia , a former Democrat, was elected  lieutenant governor  as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for  governor  as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes. \n There were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In  Maine , state legislator  Barbara Merrill  (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In  Texas ,  country music  singer and  mystery novelist   Kinky Friedman  received 12.43% of the vote, and State  Comptroller   Carole Keeton Strayhorn  received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties. \n In 2010,  Florida  governor  Charlie Crist  left the Republican party and became Independent (he later became a Democrat [25] ) rather than face former  state house   Speaker   Marco Rubio  in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee  Kendrick Meek ). \n In 2014, former  Honolulu  mayor  Mufi Hannemann  ran as an independent candidate for the  governorship  of the State of  Hawaii  after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate  David Ige  was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%. [26] \n Congress - House of Representatives and Senate [ edit ] \n There have been several independents elected to the  United States Senate  throughout history. Notable examples include  David Davis  of  Illinois  (a former  Republican ) in the 19th century, and  Harry F. Byrd, Jr.  of  Virginia  (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century. Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as  Wayne Morse  of  Oregon .  Nebraska  senator  George W. Norris  was elected for four terms as a  Republican  before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican  Kenneth S. Wherry  in 1942.  Vermont  senator  Jim Jeffords  left the  Republican Party  to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's  change of party status  was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and  Democrats  (with a Republican  Vice President ,  Dick Cheney , who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the  Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the  Congressional elections in 2002 , when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat.  Dean Barkley  of the  Independence Party of Minnesota  was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of  Paul Wellstone  who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party. \n Senator  Bernie Sanders  is the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history. [27]  He was an independent member of the  United States House of Representatives  for  Vermont-at-large  from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of  Jim Jeffords  as an independent.  Joe Lieberman  is a former  Democrat  who, like Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., ran under a third party ( Connecticut for Lieberman Party ) in the  2006 election . Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress. In 2012  Angus King  was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. As of 2016, he has caucused with the Democrats. \n The  United States House of Representatives  has also seen a handful of  independent members . Examples include  Bernie Sanders  of  Vermont ,  Virgil Goode  of  Virginia ,  Frazier Reams  of  Ohio , and  Victor Berger  of  Wisconsin . \n State and local offices [ edit ] \n In August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from  Kentucky , one from  Oregon , one from  Tennessee , and one from  New Mexico . The representatives came from the states of  Louisiana  (two),  Maine  (two),  Vermont  (two), and  Virginia  (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator  Joseph Carraro  left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection. \n In November 2005  Manny Diaz  was elected Mayor of  Miami, Florida  as an independent. [28]  On June 19, 2007,  New York Mayor   Michael Bloomberg  switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent.  Oscar Goodman , Mayor of  Las Vegas, Nevada  switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009. [29] Dan Hollingsworth  has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of  Ruston ,  Louisiana , the home of  Louisiana Tech University . \n The  Nebraska Legislature  is unique in that it is the only nonpartisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is  unicameral ), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered  open secrets  and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as  Ernie Chambers  of  Omaha , are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation. \n See also [ edit ] \n Backbencher \n Benjamin Franklin \n Centrism \n Electoral reform \n Independence Party  (disambiguation page) \n Independent Party  (disambiguation page) \n Independent (voter) \n Non-partisan democracy \n Radical centrism \n Swing vote \n Syncretic politics \n Third party (United States) \n Nonpartisanism \n Notes and references [ edit ] \n Notes: \n a. \n ^   Kosovo  is the subject of a territorial dispute between the  Republic of Kosovo  and the  Republic of Serbia .
