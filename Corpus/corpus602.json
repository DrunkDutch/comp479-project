Olsson in  Gothenburg ,  Sweden , which still serves as the company's headquarters, when he acquired Skagenlinjen between Gothenburg and  Fredrikshavn ,  Denmark . \n In 1972, Stena Line was one of the first ferry operators in Europe to introduce a computer-based reservation system for the travel business area. In 1978, the freight business area also started operating a computer-based reservation system. \n The first freight-only route started between Gothenburg, Sweden and  Kiel ,  Germany . The ship was the MS  Stena Transporter . \n During the 1980s, Stena acquired three other ferry companies. In 1981, Sessan Line, Stena's biggest competitor on Sweden\u2013Denmark routes, was acquired and incorporated into Stena Line. [1]  This included Sessan's two large newbuilds, Kronprinsessan Victoria and  Prinsessan Birgitta , which became the largest ships operated by Stena by that date. In 1983, Stena acquired Varberg-Gren\u00e5 Linjen, and two years later also the right to that company's former name,  Lion Ferry . Lion Ferry continued as a separate marketing company until 1997, when it was incorporated into Stena Line. [2]  In 1989, Stena acquired yet another ferry company,  Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ)  (which at the time traded under the name Crown Line). SMZ's  Hoek van Holland \u2013 Harwich  route then became a part of Stena Line. [3] \n Stena Line doubled in size in 1990 with the acquisition of  Sealink British Ferries  from  Sea Containers Ltd . This first became Sealink Stena Line, then Stena Sealink Line and finally Stena Line (UK), which now operates all of Stena's ferry services between  Great Britain  and  Ireland . \n Stena Jutlandica  in  Gothenburg \n In 1996, Stena Line introduced its 20,000 tonne HSS ( High-speed Sea Service ) vessels, which operated from  Belfast  to  Stranraer ,  Holyhead  to  D\u00fan Laoghaire  and  Hoek van Holland  to  Harwich . In addition to the three 1,500-passenger HSS vessels, Stena Line ordered two smaller 900-passenger HSS vessels to operate on the  Gothenburg \u2013 Frederikshavn  route. Due to the bankruptcy of the shipyard, only the first of these vessels was ever completed. \n In 1998, Stena's operations from  Dover  and  Newhaven  were merged with  P&O European Ferries  to form  P&O Stena Line , 40% of which was owned by Stena and 60% by P&O. In 2002, P&O acquired all of Stena's shares in the company, thus becoming the sole owner of P&O Stena Line, which soon changed its name to P&O Ferries. \n In 2000, Stena Line purchased yet another Scandinavian ferry operator:  Scandlines  AB. \n In November 2006, Stena ordered a pair of \"super ferries\" with a  gross tonnage  of 62,000 from  Aker Yards ,  Germany  for delivery in 2010, with an option for two more ships of the same design. [4]  The new ferries will be amongst the largest in the world, [5]  to be operated on Stena's  North Sea  route from  Hoek van Holland  to  Harwich . The existing ships from the  North Sea  were to be moved to the Kiel\u2013Gothenborg route, whereas the ships from Kiel would transfer to the  Gdynia  to  Karlskrona  route. The new ferries were launched in 2010, with  Stena Hollandica  entering service on 16 May 2010, and  Stena Britannica  planned to enter service in the autumn of 2010. [6] \n The company also moved its  Belfast  Terminal from Albert Quay to the new VT4 during May 2008. This has reduced the length of the crossing to  Stranraer  by ten minutes. \n In July 2009, Stena Line announced that it had repurchased its former ship,  Stena Parisien , from SeaFrance. The ship is now known as  Stena Navigator . She had a comprehensive refit. Following on from this, the ship was introduced on the  Stranraer  to Belfast route, alongside HSS  Stena Voyager  and  Stena Caledonia . \n Irish Sea expansion [ edit ] \n In December 2010, Stena Line announced it had acquired the Northern Irish operations of  DFDS Seaways . The sale includes the Belfast to  Heysham  &  Birkenhead  routes, two vessels from the Heysham route (Scotia Seaways & Hibernia Seaways) and two chartered vessels from the Birkenhead route ( Mersey Seaways  &  Lagan Seaways ). [7]  The  Fleetwood  to  Larne  route ended on 24 December 2010. \n On 26 February 2014 it was announced that Stena Line would acquire the Celtic Link ferry service from  Rosslare  to  Cherbourg , France. [8] \n Change on the Irish Sea [ edit ] \n In 2012 Stena Line introduced the Stena Superfast VII and Stena Superfast VIII to replace the Stena Navigator and Stena Caledonia. It was announced that the Stena Voyager would be removed from service in 2013. She has since been sold to Stena Recycling and sent for scrapping. \n Routes [ edit ] \nStena Line route map \n Irish Sea [ edit ] \n Fishguard  \u2013  Rosslare :  Stena Europe \n Holyhead  \u2013  Dublin Port :  Stena Adventurer ,  Stena Superfast X \n Belfast  \u2013  Cairnryan :  Stena Superfast VII ,  Stena Superfast VIII \n Belfast  \u2013  Heysham :  Stena Hibernia ,  Stena Precision \n Belfast  \u2013  Birkenhead :  Stena Lagan ,  Stena Mersey ,  Stena Performer \n Cherbourg  \u2013  Rosslare :  Stena Horizon \n Geary's To UK \n North Sea [ edit ] \n Hook of Holland  \u2013  Harwich :  Stena Britannica ,  Stena Hollandica \n Hook of Holland  \u2013  North Killingholme Haven :  Stena Transit ,  Stena Transporter \n Rotterdam  \u2013  Harwich :  Capucine ,  Severine \n Rotterdam  \u2013  North Killingholme Haven : \" Stena Scotia \" \n Scandinavia [ edit ] \n Gothenburg  \u2013  Fredrikshavn :  Stena Jutlandica ,  Stena Danica ,  Stena Gothica \n Varberg  \u2013  Gren\u00e5 :  Stena Nautica \n Gothenburg  \u2013  Kiel :  Stena Germanica ,  Stena Scandinavica \n Oslo  \u2013  Fredrikshavn :  Stena Saga \n Karlskrona  \u2013  Gdynia :  Stena Spirit ,  Stena Vision ,  Stena Baltica \n Nyn\u00e4shamn  \u2013  Ventspils :  Scottish Viking ,  Stena Flavia \n Trelleborg  \u2013  Rostock :  Mecklenburg Vorpommern ,  Sk\u00e5ne \n Trelleborg  \u2013  Sassnitz :  Sassnitz \n Travem\u00fcnde  \u2013  Liep\u0101ja :  Urd ,  Stena Nordica \n Fleet [ edit ] \n Further information:  List of Stena Line vessels \n Current ships [ edit ] \n Name \n Built \n Gross Tonnage \n Passengers \n Notes \n Stena Adventurer \n 2003 \n 43,532 \n 1,500 \n Stena Alegra \n 1998 \n 22,100 \n 400 \n On charter to  Interislander \n Stena Baltica \n 2007 \n 22,542 \n 200 \n On charter from  Brittany Ferries \n Stena Britannica \n 2010 \n 63,039 \n 1,200 \n Stena Carisma \n 1997 \n 8,631 \n 900 \n Stena Carrier \n 1998 \n 21,089 \n 12 \n Stena Danica \n 1983 \n 15,899 \n 2,300 \n Stena Europe \n 1981 \n 24,828 \n 1,400 \n Stena Feronia \n 1997 \n 21,856 \n 340 \n Stena Flavia \n 2008 \n 26,904 \n 830 \n On charter to  Irish Ferries \n Stena Freighter \n 1998 \n 21,004 \n 12 \n Stena Germanica \n 2001 \n 51,837  [9] \n 1,300 \n Stena Hibernia \n 1996 \n 13,017 \n 12 \n Stena Hollandica \n 2010 \n 63,039 \n 1,200 \n Stena Horizon \n 2006 \n 27,552 \n 972 \n Stena Jutlandica \n 1996 \n 29,691 \n 1,500 \n Stena Lagan \n 2005 \n 26,500 \n 980 \n Stena Mersey \n 2005 \n 26,500 \n 980 \n Stena Nautica \n 1986 \n 11,763 \n 663 \n Stena Nordica \n 2000 \n 24,206 \n 405 \n chartered to  DFDS Seaways \n Stena Saga \n 1981 \n 25,905 \n 2,000 \n Stena Scandinavica \n 2003 \n 55,050 \n 900 \n Stena Scanrail \n 1973 \n 7,504 \n 12 \n Stena Scotia \n 1996 \n 13,600 \n 12 \n Stena Spirit \n 1988 \n 39,193 \n 1,700 \n Stena Superfast VII \n 2001 \n 30,285 \n 1,200 \n Chartered from  Tallink \n Stena Superfast VIII \n 2001 \n 30,285 \n 1,200 \n Chartered from  Tallink \n Stena Superfast X \n 2002 \n 30,285 \n 1,200 \n Stena Transit \n 2011 \n 33,690 \n 300 \n Stena Transporter \n 2011 \n 33,690 \n 300 \n Stena Vision \n 1981 \n 39,178 \n 1,700 \n Gallery [ edit ] \n Stena Traveller at the Hook of Holland \n Stena Traveller at the Hook of Holland \n References [ edit ] \n Notes [ edit ] \n ^   \"Sessan Linjen\"  (in Swedish).
