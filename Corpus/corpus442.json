[1]  The term  transgenerational design  was coined in 1986, by  Syracuse University  industrial design professor James J. Pirkl [2]  to describe and identify products and  environments  that accommodate, and appeal to, the widest  spectrum  of those who would use them\u2014the young, the old, the able, the disabled\u2014without penalty to any group. [3]  The transgenerational design concept emerged from his federally funded design-for-aging research project,  Industrial design Accommodations: A Transgenerational Perspective . [4]  The project's two seminal 1988 publications [5]  provided detailed information about the aging process; informed and sensitized  industrial design  professionals and design students about the realities of human aging; and offered a useful set of guidelines and strategies for designing products that accommodate the changing needs of people of all ages and abilities. \n Contents \n 1   Overview \n 2   Benefits \n 3   History \n 3.1   Background \n 3.2   Development \n 3.3   Chronology \n 4   References \n Overview [ edit ] \n The transgenerational design concept establishes a common ground for those who are committed to integrating age and ability within the consumer population. Its underlying principle is that people, including those who are aged or impaired, have an equal right to live in a unified society. [6] \n Transgenerational design practice recognizes that human  aging  is a continuous, dynamic process that starts at birth and ends with death, and that throughout the  aging process , people normally experience occurrences of illness, accidents and declines in physical and sensory abilities that impair one\u2019s  independence  and  lifestyle . But most injuries, impairments and disabilities typically occur more frequently as one grows older and experiences the effects of  senescence  (biological aging). [7]  Four facts clarify the interrelationship of age with physical and sensory vulnerability: \n young  people become  old \n young  people can become  disabled \n old  people can become  disabled \n disabled  people become  old \n Within each situation, consumers expect products and services to fulfill and enhance their lifestyle, both physically and symbolically. Transgenerational design focuses on serving their needs through what Cagan and Vogel call \u201ca value oriented product development process\u201d. [8]  They note that a product is \u201cdeemed of value to a customer if it offers a strong effect on lifestyle, enabling features, and meaningful ergonomics\u201d resulting in products that are \u201c useful ,  usable , and  desirable \u201d during both short and long term use by people of all ages and abilities. [8] :p.34 \n Transgenerational design is \u201cframed as a market-aware response to population aging that fulfills the need for products and environments that can be used by both young and old people living and working in the same environment\u201d. [9] :p.16 \n Benefits [ edit ] \n Transgenerational design benefits all ages and abilities by creating a harmonious bond between products and the people that use them. It satisfies the  psychological ,  physiological , and  sociological  factors desired\u2014and anticipated\u2014by users of all ages and abilities: [3] :p.32 \n Safety \n Comfort \n Convenience \n Usability \n Ergonomics \n Accommodation \n Transgenerational design addresses each element and accommodates the user\u2014regardless of age or ability\u2014by providing a sympathetic fit and unencumbered ease of use. Such designs provide greater accessibility by offering wider options and more choices, thereby preserving and extending one\u2019s independence, and enhancing the  quality of life  for all ages and abilities\u2014at no group\u2019s expense. \n Transgenerational designs  accommodate  rather than  discriminate  and  sympathize  rather than  stigmatize . They do this by: [10] \n bridging the transitions across life\u2019s stages \n responding to the widest range of individual differences \n helping people remain active and independent \n adapting to changing sensory and physical needs \n maintaining one\u2019s dignity and self-respect \n enabling one to choose the appropriate means to accomplish activities of daily living \n History [ edit ] \n Transgenerational design emerged during the mid-1980s coincident with the conception of  universal design , an outgrowth of the  disability rights movement  and earlier  barrier-free  concepts. In contrast, transgenerational design grew out of the  Age Discrimination Act of 1975  (ADA), which prohibited \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of age in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance\u201d, or excluding, denying or providing different or lesser services on the basis of age. [11]  The ensuing political interest and debate over the Act\u2019s 1978 amendments, which abolished mandatory retirement at age 65, made the issues of aging a major  public policy  concern by injecting it into the mainstream of societal awareness. [12] \n Background [ edit ] \n At the start of the 1980s, the oldest members of the population, having matured during the  great depression , were being replaced by a generation of  Baby Boomers , steadily reaching  middle age  and approaching the threshold of retirement. Their swelling numbers signaled profound  demographic  changes ahead that would steadily expand the  aging population  throughout the world. \n Advancements in medical research were also changing the image of  old age \u2014from a  social  problem of the sick, poor, and senile, whose solutions depend on public policy\u2014to the emerging reality of an active  aging population  having vigor, resources, and time to apply both. [12] \n Responding to the public\u2019s growing awareness, the media, public policy, and some institutions began to recognize the impending implications.  Time  and  Newsweek  devoted cover stories to the \"Greying of America\". Local radio stations began replacing their  rock-and-roll  formats with music targeted to more mature tastes. The  Collegiate Forum  (Dow Jones & Co., Inc.) devoted its Fall 1982 issue entirely to articles on the aging work force. A  National Research Conference on Technology and Aging , and the  Office of Technological Assessment of the  House of Representatives , initiated a major examination of the impact of science and technology on older Americans\u201d. [12] \n In 1985, the  National Endowment for the Arts , the  Administration on Aging , the Farmer\u2019s Home Administration, and the  Department of Housing and Urban Development  signed an agreement to improve building, landscape, product and graphic design for older Americans, which included new research applications for  old age  that recognized the potential for making products easier to use by the elderly, and therefore more appealing and profitable. [12] \n Development [ edit ] \n In 1987, recognizing the implications of  population aging ,  Syracuse University \u2019s  Department of Design ,  All-University Gerontology Center , and  Center for Instructional Development  initiated and collaborated on an interdisciplinary project,  Industrial Design Accommodations: A Transgenerational Perspective . [4]  The year-long project, supported by a Federal grant, [4]  joined the knowledge base of  gerontology  with the professional practice of  industrial design . \n The project defined \u201cthe three aspects of aging as  physiological ,  sociological , and  psychological ; and divided the designer\u2019s responsibility into  aesthetic ,  technological , and  humanistic  concerns\u201d. [13]  The strong interrelationship between the  physiological  aspects of aging and industrial design\u2019s  humanistic  aspects established the project\u2019s instructional focus and categorized the physiological aspects of aging as the sensory and physical factors of  vision ,  hearing ,  touch , and  movement . This interrelationship was translated into a series of reference tables, which related specific  physical  and  sensory  factors of aging, and were included in the resulting set of design guidelines to: \n sensitize designers and design students to the aging process \n provide them with appropriate knowledge about this process \n accommodate the changing needs of our transgenerational population \n The project produced and published two instructional manuals\u2014one for instructors [7]  and one for design professionals [3] \u2014each containing a detailed set of \"design guidelines and strategies for designing transgenerationalproducts\". Under terms of the grant, instructional manuals were distributed to all academic programs of industrial design recognized by the  National Association of Schools of Art and Design  (NASAD). \n Chronology [ edit ] \n 1988:  The term \u2018transgenerational design\u2019 first appears to have been publicly recognized and acknowledged by the  Bristol-Myers  Company in its Annual Report, which stated, \u201cThe trend towards transgenerational design seems to be catching on in some fields\u201d, noting that \u201ctransgenerational design has the added advantage of circumventing the stigmatizing label of being \u2018old\u2019 \u201d. [14] \n 1989:  The results of the 1987 Federal grant project were first presented at the national conference,  Exploration: Technological Innovations for an Aging Population , supported in part by the  American Association of Retired Persons  (AARP) and the  National Institute on Aging . [15]  The proceedings focused \u201con current efforts to address the impact of technology and an aging population, identification of high impact issues and problems, innovative ideas, and potential solutions\u201d. \n Also in 1989  Design News , the Japanese design magazine, introduced \u201cthe new concept of  transgenerational design  (for) coping with the needs of an aging population and its strategy\u201d, stating that \u201cthe impact will soon be felt by all global institutions\u201d and \u201calter the present course of industrial design practice and education\u201d. [16] \n 1990:  The  OXO  company introduced the first group of 15  Good Grips  kitchen tools to the U.S. Market. The company states that \u201cthese ergonomically-designed, transgenerational tools set a new standard for the industry and raised the bar to consumer expectation for comfort and performance\u201d. [17]  Sam Farber, OXOs founder, says that \u201cpopulation trends demand transgenerational products, products that will be useful to you throughout the course of your life\u201d because \u201cit extends the life of a product and its materials by anticipating the whole experience of the user\u201d. [18] \n 1991:  The Fall issue of the  Design Management Journal  addressed the issue of \u201cResponsible Design\u201d and introduced the transgenerational design concept in the article, \u201cTransgenerational Design: A Strategy Whose Time Has Arrived\u201d. The article presented a description, the rationale, and examples of early transgenerational products, and offered \u201cinsights on the rationale and benefits of such a transgenerational approach\u201d. [19] \n 1993:  The September\u2013October issue of \u2018\u2019 AARP  The Magazine\u2019\u2019 exposed the transgenerational design concept to the readers in a featured article, \u201cThis Bold House\u201d, describing the concept, details, and benefits of a transgenerational house. The article noted that \u201ceasy-grip handles, flat thresholds, and adjustable-height vanities are just the beginning in the world\u2019s most accessible house,\u201d providing families of all ages and abilities with \u201cwhat they will want and need their whole lives\u201d. [20] \n In November, the transgenerational design concept was introduced in presentations to the European design community at the international symposiums, \u201cDesigning for Our Future Selves\u201d, held at the  Royal College of Art  in London and the  Netherlands Design Institute  in Rotterdam. \n 1994:  The book,  Transgenerational Design: Products for an Aging Population  (Pirkl 1994), may be regarded as the prime mover of the widespread acceptance and practice of the transgenerational design concept. It presented the first specialized content and photographic examples of transgenerational products and environments, offering \u201cpractical strategies in response to  population aging , along with case study examples based on applying a better understanding of age-related capabilities\u201d. [9]  It introduced the transgenerational design concept to the international design and  gerontology  communities, broadening the conventional idea of \u201cenvironmental support\u201d to include the product environment, sparking scholarly discussions and comparisons with other emerging concepts: ( universal design , design for all,  inclusive design , and  gerontechnology ). \n 1995:  The transgenerational design concept was presented at the first of the \u2018\u2019International Guest Lecture Series by World Experts\u2019\u2019, sponsored by the  European Design for Aging Network  (DAN) held consecutively at five international symposiums, \u201cDesigning for Our Future Selves\u201d:  Royal College of Art , London, November 15;  Eindhoven University of Technology , Eindhoven, November 16\u201319;  The Netherlands Design Institute , Amsterdam, November 21;  University of Art and Design , Helsinki, November 23\u201325; and  National College of Art and Design , Dublin, November 26\u201329. \n 2000:  \u201cThe Transgenerational House: A Case Study in Accessible Design and Construction\u201d was presented in June at \u2018\u2019Designing for the 21st Century: An International Conference on Universal Design\u2019\u2019, held at the Rhode Island College of Art and Design, Providence, RI. \n 2007:   Architectural Graphic Standards , published by the  American Institute of Architects  and commonly referred to as the \u201carchitects bible\u201d, presented a \u201cTransgenerational House\u201d case study in its \" Inclusive Design \" section. Described as an \u201cintricate exploration in how the execution of detailed thought can create a living environment that serves the young and old alike, across generations\u201d, the study includes plans for the room layout, kitchen, laundry, master bath, adjustable-height vanity, and roll-in shower. [21] \n 2012:  The proliferation of transgenerational design has diminished the tendency to associate age and disability with deficit, decline and incompetence by providing a market-aware response to population aging and the need for living and work environments used by young and old people living and working in the same environment. [22] \n Continuing to emerge as a growing strategy for developing products, services and environments that accommodate people of all ages and abilities, \"transgenerational design has been adopted by major corporations, like  Intel ,  Microsoft  and  Kodak \u201d who are \u201clooking at product development the same way as designing products for people with visual, hearing and physical impairments,\u201d so that people of any age can use them. [23] \n Discussions between designers and marketers are indicating that successful transgenerational design \u201crequires the right balance of upfront research work, solid human factors analysis, extensive design exploration, testing and a lot of thought to get it right\u201d, and that \u201ctransgenerational design is applicable to any consumer products company\u2014from appliance manufacturers to electronics companies, furniture makers, kitchen and bath and mainstream consumer products companies\u201d.
