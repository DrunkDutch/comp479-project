While in  high school  he produced the humor magazine  Esnesnon  (\"nonsense\" backwards). [4]  He later graduated from  Emerson College  in 1992 with a film degree. [5]  While at Emerson, he worked for the school humor magazine, school newspaper, WERS 88.9 FM radio, and served as art director on several dramatic plays. \n Early work [ edit ] \n After graduating from Emerson, Scott lived in  Harvard Square  in  Cambridge, Massachusetts , where he was employed as a  temp worker  while also drawing caricatures for pay on the streets of Cambridge. [6] \n Projects [ edit ] \n In 1990, along with John Anthony Rescigno (who was known by the pseudonym \"Trout.Complex\"), Scott started  TinyTIM , a popular  MUSH . He resigned in 2000. [7]  In 1995, Jason joined the video game company  Psygnosis  as a technical support worker, before being hired by a video game startup, Focus Studios, as an art director. After Focus Studios' closure, Jason moved into UNIX administration, [8]  where he remained until 2009. \n He has been a speaker at  DEF CON , an annual  hacker conference , the first time at the 7th conference in 1999, and has spoken there almost every year since then.

This collaborative effort allowed the fledgling party to utilize the existing support structure of an established conference. \n In January 2009, he formed \" Archive Team \", [12]  a group dedicated to preserving the historical record of websites that close down. Responding [13]  to the announcement by  AOL  of the closure of  AOL Hometown , the team has also announced [14]  plans to save [15]  Podango and  GeoCities . \n In October 2009, he started raising funds for a year-long sabbatical from his job as a computer systems administrator, to pursue technology history and archival projects full-time. By November 2009, he had reached his funding goals, with the support of over 300 patrons. [16] \n In early 2011, he was involved in  Yahoo! Video  and  Google Video  archive projects.
