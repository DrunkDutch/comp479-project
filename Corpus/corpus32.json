part-time faculty union \n by  \u00c9tienne Lajoie \n September 12, 2017 \n 0 comment \n New collective agreement will reduce number of credits necessary for health care coverage \n Concordia University Part-Time Faculty Association (CUPFA) chair of communications Laurie Milner left a tenure position at Vancouver\u2019s Emily Carr University of Art and Design for a part-time faculty position at Concordia. \n It\u2019s a unique situation, she admitted, but she \u201cwanted other things in life, other than being inside one academic community.\u201d While being a part-time faculty member allows her to work outside the university, it is also a lot more unstable than working full-time. \n \u201cThe stresses for a part-time faculty member can be pretty high in terms of job security,\u201d Milner told  The Concordian .  That\u2019s because part-time teachers apply for courses at the beginning of every year, no matter how long they\u2019ve been working at Concordia. Milner said part-time faculty often start with only three or six teaching credits a year, the equivalent of just one or two classes. \n This issue is compounded by the fact that CUPFA members are only eligible for health care coverage after 50 credits of seniority, a condition agreed upon in their last collective agreement signed in April 2012. \n Milner said \u201cpart-time faculty often [don\u2019t] have coverage for nine to 10 years\u201d because of that condition. \n The union\u2019s new collective agreement with the school\u2014which has to be approved by Concordia\u2019s Board of Governors\u2014will reduce the number of credits necessary to obtain coverage from 50 to 45. The health care plan includes access to psychologists and other mental health professionals. \n In a statement, Concordia University vice-president of services Roger C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the agreement between both sides was a \u201crepresentation of the teamwork and positive contributions of all parties.\u201d \u00a0Milner said CUPFA members are happy with the agreement, but wished the number of credits to qualify was even lower. \n CUPFA\u2019s chair of communications added that the topic of mental health has been discussed in the Department of Studio Arts\u2019 appraisal committee where Milner said departments do a \u201cvery intensive self-reflective analysis of where we are and where we want to be.\u201d \n The topic of mental health was also discussed in a Fine Arts Faculty Council Steering Committee by the faculty\u2019s dean, Rebecca Duclos. Milner said \u201cshe was very happy [\u2026] it was raised as one of the issues we should focus on more.\u201d \n Duclos was a part-time faculty member herself at Concordia and eventually became the dean of graduate studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before returning to Concordia in August 2015. \n Milner, who described Duclos as \u201csensitive to part-time [faculty],\u201d said department chairs and deans have a big influence. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that you have a chair who is not particularly sensitive or supportive of part-time faculty, and they set things up in ways that suddenly exclude you from courses that you\u2019ve been teaching for a very long time,\u201d Milner explained. \n According to Milner, the university has lost about 100 part-time faculty members in the last 10 years because of the increase in limited-term appointments or LTAs. \n These positions are described by the Concordia University Faculty Association as appointments \u201climited to a stated term and which carries no implication that the appointee [will] be reappointed or considered for tenure.\u201d Milner told  The Concordian  that LTAs have a heavy workload which consists of six courses in their first year and seven in their second and third, which pales in comparison to the workload of part-time faculty members. \n \u201cIf [part-time faculty] have been there awhile, they\u2019re not only losing money\u2014they\u2019re losing the health insurance if they had it, they lose their access to the library to continue their research,\u201d Milner said. \u201cSo the stakes are so high for people.\u201d \n Photo by Alex Hutchins \n Instability of work is cause of stress for Concordia\u2019s part-time faculty union  was last modified:   September 12th, 2017  by  \u00c9tienne Lajoie   \n CUPFA health news Part-Time Faculty   \n 0 comment \n 0   \n Facebook \n Twitter \n Google + \n Pinterest \n \u00c9tienne Lajoie \n previous post \n A glimpse into the world of visual effects at Effects MTL \n next post \n Carrying fentanyl\u2019s kryptonite at Concordia \n Related Articles \n CSU finance coordinator resigns for personal reasons \n November 22, 2017 \n Reggies\u2019s board of directors projects $6,000 deficit... \n November 22, 2017 \n Make room for the millennial \n November 21, 2017 \n Concordia opens new wellness centre downtown \n November 21, 2017 \n Facebook \n Twitter \n Instagram \n Youtube \n RSS \n \u00a9 Copyright 2017, All Rights Reserved. \n Back To Top"}
