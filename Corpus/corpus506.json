[1]  The specific paraphilias are  biastophilia  (paraphilic  rape ),  exhibitionism ,  frotteurism ,  telephone scatologia , and  voyeurism . According to the  courtship disorder hypothesis , there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result in one of these paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.

[3] [4]  These phases are: \"(1) looking for and appraising potential sexual partners; (2) pretactile interaction with those partners, such as by smiling at and talking to them; (3) tactile interaction with them, such as by embracing or petting; (4) and then sexual intercourse.\" [5] \n The associations between these phases and these paraphilias were first outlined by  Kurt Freund , [6] [7]  the originator of the theory: A disturbance of the search phase of courtship manifests as  voyeurism , a disturbance of the pretactile interaction phase manifests as  exhibitionism  or  telephone scatologia , a disturbance of the tactile interaction phase manifests as toucheurism or  frotteurism , and the absence of the courtship behavior phases manifests as paraphilic  rape  (i.e.,  biastophilia ). According to Freund, these paraphilias \"can be conceptualized as a preference for a pattern of behavior or  erotic fantasy  in which one of these four phases of sexual interaction is intensified and distorted to such an extent that it appears to be a caricature of the normal, while the remaining phases are either omitted entirely or are retained only in a vestigial way.\" [8] \n Freund noted that  troilism  (a paraphilia for observing one\u2019s sexual/romantic partner sexually interacting with a third party, usually unbeknownst to the third party) [9]  might also be a courtship disorder, [8] [10]  troilism being a variant of voyeurism. \n Appropriate behaviors depend on the social and cultural context, including time and place. Some behaviors that are unacceptable under most circumstances, such as  public nudity  or sexual contact between dancers, may be accepted or even encouraged during celebrations like  Carnival  or  Mardi Gras . Where such cultural festivals alter normative courtship behaviors, the signs of courtship disorder may be masked or altered. [11] \n Evidence and acceptance of the theory [ edit ] \n Paraphilias within the Courtship Disorder spectrum co-occur with each other more frequently than with paraphilias outside the courtship disorder spectrum. [12] [13] [14] [15]  The courtship disorder model offers an underlying common cause for these paraphilias in men to explain this co-occurrence. [6] [7] \n Courtship disorder is widely cited by  sexologists  and forensic scientists as one of the predominant models of the paraphilias. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  Murphy and Page wrote that \"The 'Courtship Disorder Theory' of Freund is one of the only theories specific to exhibitionism.\" [21]  According to Lavin (2008), \"Freund's theory, more than the others, makes it clear that the ordering of activities ... has clinical significance.\" [22] \n Another theoretically based taxonomy of the paraphilias was proposed by  John Money , who described the range of paraphilic interests as  love maps .
