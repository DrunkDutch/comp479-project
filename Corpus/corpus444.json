Basic prerequisites are a thorough knowledge of chemical and physical properties [1]  of pure components and mixtures, of reactions, and of mathematical models which, in combination, allow the calculation of a process in computers. \n Process simulation software describes processes in  flow diagrams  where  unit operations  are positioned and connected by product or educt streams. The software has to solve the  mass  and  energy balance  to find a stable operating point. The goal of a process simulation is to find optimal conditions for an examined process. This is essentially an  optimization  problem which has to be solved in an iterative process. \n Process simulation always use models which introduce  approximations  and assumptions but allow the description of a property over a wide range of temperatures and pressures which might not be covered by real data. Models also allow  interpolation  and  extrapolation  - within certain limits - and enable the search for conditions outside the range of known properties. \n Modelling [ edit ] \n The development of models [2]  for a better representation of real processes is the core of the further development of the simulation software. Model development is done on the chemical engineering side but also in control engineering and for the improvement of mathematical simulation techniques. Process simulation is therefore one of the few fields where scientists from  chemistry ,  physics ,  computer science ,  mathematics , and several  engineering  fields work together. \n VLE  of the mixture of Chloroform and Methanol plus  NRTL  fit and  extrapolation  to different pressures \n A lot of efforts are made to develop new and improved models for the calculation of properties. This includes for example the description of \n thermophysical properties like  vapor pressures ,  viscosities , caloric data, etc. of pure components and mixtures \n properties of different apparatuses like reactors, distillation columns, pumps, etc. \n chemical reactions and  kinetics \n environmental and safety-related data \n Two main different types of models can be distinguished: \n Rather simple equations and  correlations  where parameters are fitted to experimental data. \n Predictive methods where properties are estimated. \n The equations and correlations are normally preferred because they describe the property (almost) exactly. To obtain reliable parameters it is necessary to have experimental data which are usually obtained from factual data banks [3] [4]  or, if no data are publicly available, from  measurements . \n Using predictive methods is much cheaper than experimental work and also than data from data banks. Despite this big advantage predicted properties are normally only used in early steps of the process development to find first approximate solutions and to exclude wrong pathways because these estimation methods normally introduce higher errors than correlations obtained from real data. \n Process simulation also encouraged the further development of mathematical models in the fields of  numerics  and the solving of complex problems. [5] [6] \n History [ edit ] \n The history of process simulation is strongly related to the development of the  computer science  and of computer hardware and programming languages. Early working simple implementations of partial aspects of chemical processes were introduced in the 1970s when suitable hardware and software (here mainly the programming languages  FORTRAN  and  C ) became available. The modelling of chemical properties began much earlier, notably the cubic  equation of states  and the  Antoine equation  were precursory developments of the 19th century. \n Steady state and dynamic process simulation [ edit ] \n Initially process simulation was used to simulate  steady state  processes. Steady-state models perform a mass and energy balance of a stationary process (a process in an equilibrium state) it does not depend on time. \n Dynamic simulation is an extension of steady-state process simulation whereby time-dependence is built into the models via derivative terms i.e. accumulation of mass and energy. The advent of dynamic simulation means that the time-dependent description, prediction and control of real processes in real time has become possible. This includes the description of starting up and shutting down a plant, changes of conditions during a reaction, holdups, thermal changes and more. \n Dynamic simulations require increased calculation time and are mathematically more complex than a steady state simulation. It can be seen as a multiply repeated steady state simulation (based on a fixed time step) with constantly changing parameters. \n Dynamic simulation can be used in both an online and offline fashion. The online case being model predictive control, where the real-time simulation results are used to predict the changes that would occur for a control input change, and the control parameters are optimised based on the results. Offline process simulation can be used in the design, troubleshooting and optimisation of process plant as well as the conduction of case studies to assess the impacts of process modifications. Dynamic simulation is also used for  operator training . \n See also [ edit ] \n Advanced Simulation Library [7] \n Computer simulation \n List of chemical process simulators \n Software Process simulation \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Rhodes C.L., \u201cThe Process Simulation Revolution: Thermophysical Property Needs and Concerns\u201d, J.Chem.Eng.Data, 41, 947-950, 1996 \n ^   Gani R., Pistikopoulos E.N., \u201cProperty Modelling and Simulation for Product and Process Design\u2033, Fluid Phase Equilib., 194-197, 43-59, 2002 \n ^   Marsh K., Satyro M.A., \u201cIntegration of Databases and their Impact on Process Simulation and Design\u201d, Conference, Lake Tahoe, USA, 1994, 1-14, 1994 \n ^   Wadsley M.W., \u201cThermochemical and Thermophysical Property Databases for Computational Chemical Process Simulation\u201d, Conference, Korea, Seoul, August 30 - September 2, 1998, 253-256, 1998 \n ^   Saeger R.B., Bishnoi P.R., \u201cA Modified 'Inside-Out' Algorithm for Simulation of Multistage Multicomponent Separation Processes Using the UNIFAC Group-Contribution Method\u201d, Can.J.Chem.Eng., 64, 759-767, 1986 \n ^   Mallya J.U., Zitney S.E., Choudhary S., Stadtherr M.A., \u201cParallel Frontal Solver for Large-Scale Process Simulation and Optimization\u2033, AIChE J., 43(4), 1032-1040, 1997 \n ^   \"ASL: Physical Vapor Deposition Simulation\" . \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Process_simulation&oldid=801531196 \"\t\t\t\t\t \n Categories :  Chemical process engineering Simulation Industrial design Process engineering   \n Navigation menu \n Personal tools \n Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in   \n Namespaces \n Article Talk   \n Variants \n Views \n Read Edit View history   \n More \n Search \n Navigation \n Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store   \n Interaction \n Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page   \n Tools \n What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item Cite this page   \n Print/export \n Create a book Download as PDF Printable version   \n In other projects \n Wikimedia Commons   \n Languages \n Deutsch Italiano \u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430   \n Edit links   \n  This page was last edited on 20 September 2017, at 06:47. \n Text is available under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.
