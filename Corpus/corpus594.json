Formally, these limits and requirements are published by the  Panama Canal Authority (ACP) , titled \"Vessel Requirements\". [1]  These requirements also describe topics like exceptional dry seasonal limits, propulsion, communications, and detailed ship design. \n The allowable size is limited by the width and length of the available  lock  chambers, by the depth of water in the canal, and by the height of the  Bridge of the Americas  since that bridge's construction. These dimensions give clear parameters for ships destined to traverse the Panama Canal and have influenced the design of cargo ships, naval vessels, and passenger ships. \n Panamax specifications have been in effect since the opening of the canal in 1914. In 2009 the ACP published the  New Panamax  specification [2]  which came into effect when the canal's  third set of locks , larger than the original two, opened on 26 June 2016. Ships that do not fall within the Panamax-sizes are called  post-Panamax . \n The increasing prevalence of vessels of the maximum size is a problem for the canal, as a Panamax ship is a tight fit that requires precise control of the vessel in the locks, possibly resulting in longer lock time, and requiring that these ships transit in daylight. Because the largest ships traveling in opposite directions cannot pass safely within the  Culebra Cut , the canal effectively operates an alternating one-way system for these ships. \n Contents \n 1   Ship dimensions \n 1.1   Length \n 1.2   Width (beam) \n 1.3   Draft \n 1.4   Air draft \n 1.5   Cargo capacity \n 1.6   Records \n 2   Expansion plans \n 2.1   Neopanamax \n 2.2   Impact on world ports \n 3   Impact on existing ships \n 3.1   Comparison of sizes \n 4   Post-Panamax ships \n 5   See also \n 6   References \n 7   External links \n Ship dimensions [ edit ] \nAn officer monitors the clearance of the cruise ship  Ryndam  as she traverses the lock. \nPanamax  container ship \n USS\u00a0 Missouri , one of the  Iowa -class   battleships , makes a very tight fit as she passes through the Miraflores Locks of the  Panama Canal  in October 1945. \n Panamax is determined principally by the dimensions of the  canal's original lock chambers , each of which is 110\u00a0ft (33.53\u00a0m) wide, 1,050\u00a0ft (320.04\u00a0m) long, and 41.2\u00a0ft (12.56\u00a0m) deep. The usable length of each lock chamber is 1,000\u00a0ft (304.8\u00a0m). The available water depth in the lock chambers varies, but the shallowest depth is at the south sill of the  Pedro Miguel Locks  and is 41.2\u00a0ft (12.56\u00a0m) at a Miraflores Lake level of 54\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (16.61\u00a0m). The clearance under the  Bridge of the Americas  at  Balboa  is the limiting factor on a vessel's overall height for both Panamax and Neopanamax ships; the exact figure depends on the water level. \n The maximum dimensions allowed for a ship transiting the canal using the original locks and the new locks (New Panamax) are: [1] \n Length [ edit ] \n Overall (including protrusions): 950\u00a0ft (289.56\u00a0m). Exceptions: \n Container ship and passenger ship: 965\u00a0ft (294.13\u00a0m) \n Tug-barge combination, rigidly connected: 900\u00a0ft (274.32\u00a0m) overall \n Other non-self-propelled vessels-tug combination: 850\u00a0ft (259.08\u00a0m) overall; \n New Panamax increases allowable length to 366\u00a0m (1,201\u00a0ft). [2] \n Width (beam) [ edit ] \n Width over outer surface of the shell plating: 106\u00a0ft (32.31\u00a0m). General exception: 107\u00a0ft (32.61\u00a0m), when draft is less than 37\u00a0ft (11.3\u00a0m) in tropical fresh water. \n New Panamax increases allowable width to 49\u00a0m (161\u00a0ft). [2] \n Draft [ edit ] \n 39.5\u00a0ft (12.04\u00a0m) in Tropical Fresh Water (TFW). The name and definition of TFW is created by ACP using the freshwater  Lake Gat\u00fan  as a reference, since this is the determination of the maximum draft. The salinity and temperature of water affect its density, and hence how deep a ship will float in the water. Tropical Fresh Water (TFW) is fresh water of Lake Gat\u00fan, with density 0.9954 g/cm 3 , at 29.1\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F). [3]  The physical limit is set by the lower (seaside) entrance of the Pedro Miguel locks. When the water level in Lake Gat\u00fan is low during an exceptionally dry season the maximum permitted draft may be reduced. Such a restriction is published three weeks in advance, so ship loading plans can take appropriate measures. \n New Panamax increases allowable draft to 15.2\u00a0m (49.9\u00a0ft), [2]  however due to low rainfall, the canal authority limited draft to 43 feet when the new locks opened in June 2016, increasing it to 44 feet (13.41 meters), in August \"based on the current level of Gatun Lake and the weather forecast for the following weeks.\" [4] \n Air draft [ edit ] \n 190\u00a0ft (57.91\u00a0m) measured from the waterline to the vessel's highest point; limit also pertains to New Panamax and Balboa harbor. Exception: 205\u00a0ft (62.5\u00a0m) when passage at low water (MLWS) at Balboa is possible. \n All exceptions are typically allowed only after specific request and an investigation, and on a once- or twice-only basis. \n Cargo capacity [ edit ] \n A Panamax cargo ship would typically have a  DWT  of 65,000\u201380,000  tonnes , but its maximum cargo would be about 52,500 tonnes during a transit due to draft limitations in the canal. [5]  New Panamax ships can carry 120,000 DWT. [6]  Panamax container ships can carry 5,000\u00a0 twenty-foot equivalent units \u00a0(TEU); with 13,000\u00a0 TEU  for New Panamax vessels. \n Records [ edit ] \n The longest ship ever to transit the original locks was  San Juan Prospector , now  Marcona Prospector , an  ore-bulk-oil carrier  that is 973\u00a0ft (296.57\u00a0m) long, with a beam of 106\u00a0ft (32.31\u00a0m). [7]  The widest ships to transit are the four  Iowa -class   battleships  ( Iowa ,  New Jersey ,  Missouri , and  Wisconsin ), which have a maximum beam of 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m), leaving less than 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) margin of error between the ships and the walls of the locks. [8] \n Expansion plans [ edit ] \n Main article:  Panama Canal expansion project \n As early as the 1930s,  new locks were proposed for the Panama Canal  to ease congestion and to allow larger ships to pass. The project was abandoned in 1942. \n On October 22, 2006, the  Panama Canal Authority  (with the support of the Electoral Tribunal) held a  referendum  for Panamanian citizens to vote on the  Panama Canal expansion project . The expansion was approved by a  wide margin , with support from about 78% of the electorate. Construction began in 2007, and after several delays, the new locks opened for commercial traffic on 26 June 2016. [9] \n Neopanamax [ edit ] \n The plans to build another set of larger locks led to the creation of the  Neopanamax  or  New Panamax  ship classification, based on the new locks' dimensions of 427\u00a0m (1,401\u00a0ft) in length, 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft) in beam, and 18.3\u00a0m (60.0\u00a0ft) in depth. [2]   Naval architects  and  civil engineers  began taking into account these dimensions for container ships. [10]  Since the completion of the expansion in June 2016, the Panama Canal is able to handle vessels with overall length of 366 m (1201 feet), 49 meters beam and 15.2 meters draft. [2]  and cargo capacity up to 14,000\u00a0 twenty-foot equivalent units \u00a0(TEU); [11]  previously, it could only handle vessels up to about 5,000\u00a0 TEU . [12]  The Neopanamax standard will be able to accommodate ships up to 120,000 DWT. [6] \n Impact on world ports [ edit ] \nNavigational clearance under the  Bayonne Bridge  in New York harbor is being increased to accommodate New Panamax ships. The lower roadway will be removed once the new upper roadway is operational. \n Several ports, including the ports of  New York and New Jersey ,  Norfolk , and  Baltimore , all on the East Coast of the United States, have already increased their depth to at least 50 feet (15\u00a0m) to accommodate New Panamax ships; the  Port of Miami  has recently approved the same in a project known as the \" Deep Dredge \" [13]  and will be the closest deep-water port to the Panama Canal in the US.  Liverpool  is building a new container terminal,  Liverpool2 , where ships berth in the tidal river rather than in the enclosed docks, to coincide with the opening of the widened Panama Canal locks. In  Halifax  a major expansion of the South End Container Terminal was completed in 2012, extending the pier and increasing the berth depth from 14.5 to 16 metres (48 to 52\u00a0ft). [14]  The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  is raising the clearance of the  Bayonne Bridge  to 215 feet (66 m), at a cost of $1.3 billion, due in late 2017, to allow New Panamax ships to reach container port facilities at  Port Newark\u2013Elizabeth Marine Terminal . Currently,  GCT Bayonne , Global Container, can handle the New Panamax ships. Maersk will wait until the Bayonne Bridge is raised. As of April 2012, a controversy between  Savannah, Georgia , and  Charleston, South Carolina , over limited federal funding for dredging/deepening projects\u2014including both state and federal lawsuits filed by environmental groups in both states opposing the techniques planned to be used in dredging the Savannah River\u2014also revolves around attracting the business of carriers whose fleets include New Panamax vessels.  Jacksonville, Florida , is pursuing its \"Mile Point\" project with the prospect of deepening the St. John's River in anticipation of Post-Panamax traffic;  Mobile, Alabama , has completed the deepening of its harbor to 45 feet (14\u00a0m) for the same reason; and other ports seem likely to follow suit. \n Impact on existing ships [ edit ] \n Due to the expansion, demand for 'Old Panamax' ships has plummetted, resulting in ships being traded at scrap value. Some ships only 7 years old have been sold for scrap.

The first known post-Panamax ship was the  RMS  Queen Mary , launched in 1934, built with a 118-foot beam as she was intended solely for North Atlantic passenger runs. When she was moved to  Long Beach, California , as a tourist attraction in 1967, a lengthy voyage around  Cape Horn  was necessary. [17]  The first post-Panamax warships were the Japanese  Yamato -class battleships , launched in 1940. [18]  Until World War II, the United States Navy required that all of their warships be capable of transiting the Panama Canal. The first US Navy warship design to exceed Panamax limits was the  Montana -class   battleship , designed circa 1940 but never built. The limit was specifically removed by the  Secretary of the Navy  on 12 February 1940, with the (never-realized) prospect of a new set of 140-foot wide locks to be built for the Canal. [19]  The  Essex -class   aircraft carriers  were designed with a folding deck-edge elevator to meet Panamax limits; the limit did not apply to subsequent US aircraft carriers. [20] \n Even with the larger locks that went into service in 2016, there are still ships that cannot pass through the Panama Canal. These include  M\u00e6rsk E-class  and  Maersk Triple E class  container ships,  TI-class supertankers , and  Valemax  ore carriers, all of which are too wide for the new locks. Furthermore, while the world's largest cruise ships,  Oasis of the Seas ,  Allure of the Seas  and the  Harmony of the Seas  will fit within the new locks, they are too tall to pass under the  Bridge of the Americas  even at low tide unless the Bridge of the Americas is raised. \n See also [ edit ] \n Cargo ship sizes   Handymax , Panamax,  Suezmax ,  Capesize \n List of Panamax ports \n References [ edit ] \n ^  a   b   \"Vessel Requirements\"   (PDF) .
