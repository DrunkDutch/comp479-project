Ensure that it is fully plugged in and seated correctly. If this has no effect, then your cable or monitor might be defective. Test it with another cable. If it works with the second cable, then the first cable could be damaged. If it doesn't work with either, then there may be a problem with the monitor. \n Thanks! \n 0 \n 8 \n When I select display settings the display shows 1|2 and I can't differentiate between my monitors.
