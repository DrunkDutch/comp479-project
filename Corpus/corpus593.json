[7]  It operates domestic and international scheduled services on over 820 routes in more than 30 countries. [8] [9]  easyJet plc is listed on the  London Stock Exchange  and is a constituent of the  FTSE 100 Index . [10]   easyGroup  Holdings Ltd (the investment vehicle of the airline's founder  Stelios Haji-Ioannou  and his family) is the largest shareholder with a 34.62% stake (as of July 2014). [11]  It employs nearly 11,000 people, based throughout Europe but mainly in the UK. [12] \n EasyJet has seen expansion since its establishment in 1995, having grown through a combination of  acquisitions [13] [14]  and base openings fuelled by consumer demand for low-cost air travel. The airline, along with associate companies  easyJet Europe  and  easyJet Switzerland , operate more than 200 aircraft, [15]  mostly  Airbus A319 . [15]  It has 28 bases across Europe, the largest being  Gatwick . [16]  In 2014 the airline carried more than 65\u00a0million passengers, [17]  making it the second-largest airline in Europe by number of passengers carried, behind  Ryanair . [18] \n EasyJet was featured in the television series  Airline  broadcast on  ITV  which followed the airline's operations at London Luton and later at other bases. Its pilot training scheme was the subject of another ITV television series,  easyJet: Inside the Cockpit , which premiered in August 2017. [19] \n ' The airline was established in 1995, the first company in what would later become the  easyGroup  conglomerate. It was launched by Greek Cypriot businessman Stelios Haji-Ioannou with two  wet leased   Boeing 737-200  aircraft, initially operating two routes: London Luton Airport to  Glasgow  and  Edinburgh . In April 1996, the first wholly owned aircraft was delivered to the airline, enabling its first international route, to Amsterdam. Until October 1997, the aircraft were operated by  GB Airways  and subsequently by Air Foyle, as easyJet had not yet received its  Air Operator's Certificate . [20] \n EasyJet was floated on the  London Stock Exchange  on 5 November 2000. [20]  In October 2004 the  FL Group , owner of the airlines  Icelandair  and  Sterling , purchased an 8.4% stake in the airline. [21]  Over the course of 2005, FL increased its share in the company periodically to 16.9%, [21]  fuelling speculation that it would mount a takeover bid for the UK carrier. [22]  However, in April 2006 the threat of takeover receded as FL sold its stake for \u20ac325\u00a0million, securing a profit of \u20ac140m on its investment. [23]  In November 2005, Ray Webster stood down after 10 years as chief executive officer (CEO) and was replaced by former  RAC plc  CEO, Andrew Harrison.

As part of this, the airline has also purchased several rivals, including  GB Airways . \n Go Fly   Boeing 737-300  in 2004 \n In March 1998, easyJet purchased a 40% stake in Swiss charter airline  TEA Basle  for three million  Swiss francs . The airline was renamed  easyJet Switzerland  and commenced  franchise  services on 1 April 1999, having relocated its headquarters to  Geneva International Airport . This was easyJet's first new base outside the United Kingdom. [20]  In 2002, rival airline  Go Fly  was purchased for \u00a3374\u00a0million; the airline inherited three new bases from Go, at  Bristol Airport ,  East Midlands Airport  and  London Stansted Airport . The acquisition of Go almost doubled the number of  Boeing 737-300  aircraft in the easyJet fleet. [13] [25] \n In 2002, the airline opened its base at  Gatwick Airport , and between 2003 and 2007 opened bases in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, establishing a presence in continental Europe. [20]  In 2007, the airline claimed to be operating more flights per day than any other European airline. [26] \n On 25 October 2007 easyJet purchased the entire share capital of  GB Airways  from the  Bland Group . The deal was worth \u00a3103.5\u00a0million, and was used by the airline to expand operations at Gatwick [27]  and to establish a base at  Manchester Airport . [14] [28] [29] [30] [31] \n In June 2011, the airline opened its eleventh British base \u2013 at  London Southend Airport , offering flights to Alicante, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Belfast, Faro, M\u00e1laga, Jersey, Palma de Majorca and Ibiza. [32] \n In March 2013, the airline was promoted to the  FTSE 100  and launched its 100th route from Gatwick Airport, offering flights directly from London to Moscow. [33] \n On 28 October 2017, easyJet announced it will lease 25 A320 former  Air Berlin  aircraft to operate at  Berlin Tegel Airport . Previously EasyJet only operated from  Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport . [34] \n As of November 2017 easyJet owns and operates 10 aircraft under its Austrian guise easyJet Europe, the aircraft, all previously owned UK Registered aircraft were transferred to Austria's \"OE-\" registration prefix, the aircraft are mainly based in Vienna for the time being but will soon be deployed across their entire route network. To commemorate this new chapter in the airlines history, their first Austrian aircraft \"OE-IVA\" was given a special paint job sporting an image of Austria's mountainous terrain. \n Corporate affairs [ edit ] \n Business strategy [ edit ] \n EasyJet, like  Ryanair , uses a business model pioneered by  Southwest Airlines . Both airlines have adapted this model for the European market through further cost-cutting measures, such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points of this business model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as priority boarding, hold baggage and food) and keeping operating costs low. [35]  One main difference easyJet and Ryanair have from Southwest is they both fly a young fleet of aircraft. Southwest has an average fleet age of 11.9 years [36]  whereas Ryanair's and easyJet's average fleet ages are just a little over six years each. [37] \n Initially, easyJet's employment strategy was to maintain control with minimal union involvement. In recent years, the airline has adopted a different approach with a strategy in place to accommodate unions. [26] \n While the two airlines share a common business charter and concept, easyJet's strategy differs from Ryanair's in several areas. The most noticeable is that easyJet flies mainly to the primary airports in the cities that it serves, for the convenience of passengers, while Ryanair often chooses secondary airports to further reduce costs. For example, in servicing Paris, easyJet flies to  Charles de Gaulle Airport  and  Orly Airport , the primary airports, while Ryanair flies to the smaller  Beauvais-Till\u00e9 Airport , 85 km and a 75-minute bus journey from Paris. \n Originally, much like Southwest, easyJet did not allocate seats \u2013 passengers took any available seats, with the option to pay for \"Speedy Boarding\" and be first onto the aircraft. Since 2012, all passengers are allocated numbered seats before boarding commences, as it was found that this does not slow down boarding times and could earn more revenue than Speedy Boarding. Passengers can pay an additional fee for certain seats such as the front few rows and overwing seats (which have extra legroom).

Hangar 89, built in 1974, has 30,000 square feet (2,800\u00a0m 2 ) of office space and can house three aircraft the size of an Airbus A319 at one time. When easyJet received H89, it had a 1970s-style office setup. The airline modernised the building and painted it orange. [39] \n Marketing [ edit ] \n EasyJet's early marketing strategy was based on \"making flying as affordable as a pair of jeans\" and urged travellers to \"cut out the travel agent\". Its early advertising consisted of little more than the airline's telephone booking number painted in bright orange on the side of its aircraft. [20] \n The  Airline  TV series created by  LWT  and filmed between 1999 and 2007 made easyJet a household name in the United Kingdom. The series, while not always portraying the airline in a positive light, did much to promote it during this time. [40]  The airline has used a number of  slogans  since its establishment, including \"The Web's Favourite Airline\", \"Come on, lets fly\" and \"To Fly, To Save\" (a cheeky take on  British Airways'  slogan \"To Fly, To Serve\"). This was then followed by \"[something] by easyJet\", with \"Europe by easyJet\" and \"business by easyJet\" being the most widely used. \n It currently uses the slogan \"This is Generation easyJet\". \n Environment [ edit ] \n In June 2007, easyJet announced plans for construction of its own airliner, dubbed EcoJet. Featuring  propfan  engines, the EcoJet would feature an improvement in  fuel efficiency . It would be constructed with extensive use of  carbon fibre   composite material . The date for the first flight was to be in 2015. [41]  As of October 2014, no concrete information has been released on the proposed airliner. \n The airline offers  carbon offsetting  to its customers' trips for a  surcharge  via a calculator that estimates a passenger's  carbon footprint . [42] \n In February 2011, the airline painted eight of its aircraft with a lightweight, thin \"revolutionary nano technology coating\"  polymer . It works by reducing build-up of debris and reduces  drag  across the surface of the aircraft, thus reducing the fuel bill. It was estimated the airline could save 1\u20132% annually, equating to a \u00a314\u00a0million reduction in fuel costs. The coating has already been used on US military aircraft and if successful easyJet would apply the paint to its whole fleet. [43] \n Criticism [ edit ] \n EasyJet has been criticized in Germany for not observing  European Union  law on compensation (and assistance to passengers) in cases of denied boarding, delays or cancellations ( Regulation 261/2004 ). When flights are cancelled, passengers are supposed to be reimbursed within one week. In 2006, the airline did not always refund tickets in a timely fashion. Passengers occasionally had to wait longer for reimbursement of their expenses. [44] [45] \n EasyJet has campaigned to replace the  air passenger duty  (APD) tax in the UK with a new tax that would vary depending on distance travelled and aircraft type. [46] \n In July 2008, the  United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority  (ASA) criticised a press campaign by the airline, over a misleading environmental claim that its aircraft released 22% fewer emissions than rival airlines. The figures used were not based on emissions produced by an easyJet aircraft or emissions produced by the airline overall as the advertisement implied, and ASA declared that the airline had broken advertising rules. The judgement that followed reprimanded the airline in April 2007 after it made comments that its aircraft created 30% less pollution per passenger than some of its rivals. [47] \n In July 2011, the airline tried to refuse carriage of a boy with  muscular dystrophy  because he had an electric wheelchair. [48]  In separate incidents in 2012,  paralympians  received similar treatment, [49]  and a French court found the airline guilty of three counts of disability discrimination. [50]  In January 2017 the company was fined \u20ac60,000 by another French court because it had refused to allow a disabled passenger to board in 2010. The company cited security concerns and internal regulations; and said it would not appeal against the ruling. [51] \n In September 2013, a passenger who sent a tweet complaining about the airline after his flight was delayed said he was initially told he would not be allowed to board the aircraft because of the posting. [52] \n European AOC [ edit ] \n Following the UK\u2019s referendum vote to leave the European Union easyJet plans to establish an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) in another EU member state. This will secure the flying rights of the 30% of easyJet's network that remains wholly within and between EU states, excluding the UK. easyJet expects a one-off cost of around \u00a310 million over two years with up to \u00a35 million incurred in the 2017 financial year. The primary driver of the cost is the re-registering of aircraft in an EU AOC jurisdiction. [53] \n In July 2017 easyJet announced that it has applied for, and was subsequently granted by the  Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology , an Austrian Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and operating permit, thereby establishing  easyJet Europe . The new airline will be headquartered in Vienna, and will allow easyJet to continue operating flights across and within European countries after the UK leaves the EU. The first aircraft, an Airbus A320, was re-registered as OE-IVA.  [54] \n EasyJet announced that there will be no job losses in the UK, as the staff to be employed by easyJet Europe are already based in the EU27. easyJet UK staff will continue to be based in Luton. This will result in three airlines, easyJet UK, easyJet Europe, and easyJet Switzerland, all of which will be owned by easyJet plc, which will itself be EU owned and controlled, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and based in the UK.

Its five largest bases are London Gatwick,  Milan\u2013Malpensa , London Luton, Bristol Airport and London Stansted.  Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport  is currently the airline's smallest base with two aircraft. \n The airline has 19 European bases. Despite it being a British airline and having a significant presence there, it also has a significant presence in France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and many other European countries. The United Kingdom is its biggest market, containing the airline's largest base and nine others as well as a total of six other non-base airports. Its three largest British bases in order of size are London Gatwick and London Luton airports followed by Bristol Airport. London\u2013Stansted was once the second largest base but has seen significant reduction in recent years with flights being moved to Gatwick and the newest UK base,  Southend  which is in the same catchment area as Stansted. \n Codeshare agreements [ edit ] \n In 2013 easyJet entered a commercial agreement with  Transaero Airlines  to set up a  codeshare agreement [56] [57]  whereby Transaero acquired the right to sell a certain number of seats on easyJet's Moscow (Domodedovo) \u2013 London (Gatwick) route. This was the first codeshare agreement for easyJet and it terminated when Transaero Airlines ceased to operate in October 2015. [58]  easyJet ceased all flights to Moscow in March 2016. [59] \n easyJet has a reward miles sharing agreement with Emirates. easyJet's website states: \"Skywards members will be able to use their Skywards Miles towards any easyJet flights. Flying with Emirates to one of over 125 destinations across 76 countries including Dubai, Singapore, Delhi, Bangkok, Sydney and Cape Town will earn you miles to make connecting across Europe on our network of 600 routes between 130 airports in over 30 countries more affordable.\" [60] \n Fleet [ edit ] \n Current Fleet [ edit ] \neasyJet  Airbus A319-100 . \neasyJet  Airbus A320-200 . \n The easyJet fleet consists of the following aircraft as of November 2017: [61] [62] \n easyJet Fleet \n Aircraft \n In \nService \n Orders \n Passengers \n Notes \n Airbus A319-100 \n 127 \n \u2014 \n 156 \n easyJet is the largest operator of the Airbus A319 worldwide.

Sister company  easyJet Switzerland  operates an additional 11 Airbus A319 and 14 Airbus A320 aircraft. [65] \n Fleet strategy and aircraft orders [ edit ] \n In common with other  Low-cost carriers , easyJet has a strategy of operating just one aircraft type. Initially it used Boeing 737 aircraft exclusively, but in October 2002 it ordered 120  Airbus A319  aircraft, plus 120  options . [20] [66]  Since then, the Boeings have been phased out and all orders have been from the Airbus A320 family. Through the acquisition of  GB Airways , easyJet inherited nine Airbus A320 and six  Airbus A321  aircraft. This gave the airline some time to evaluate the feasibility of operating these larger aircraft. Based on this evaluation, easyJet exchanged 25 A319 orders for A320s in July 2008 and later removed the A321 aircraft from the fleet. [14] [28] [30] [31] \n On 18 June 2013 the airline announced an intention to acquire \u2013 subject to shareholder approval \u2013 35 Airbus A320 aircraft, for delivery between 2015 and 2017, and 100 Airbus A320neo aircraft for delivery between 2017 and 2022. [67]  As part of the agreement the airline will have purchase rights on a further 100 A320neo aircraft. [67]  The current generation A320s and fifty of the A320neos will replace current aircraft. [67] \n On 15 May 2017, easyJet announced the conversion of 30 A320neo orders into A321neo aircraft. \n Historical Fleet [ edit ] \n easyJet has previously operated the following aircraft: [68] \n easyJet Historical Fleet \n Aircraft \n Introduced \n Retired \n Notes \n Airbus A321-200 \n 2008 \n 2010 \n Inherited from  GB Airways . \n Boeing 737-300 \n 1995 \n 2007 \n Replaced by A319s. \n Boeing 737-700 \n 2000 \n 2011 \n Replaced by A319s and A320s. \n Services [ edit ] \n Booking [ edit ] \nBoeing 737-33V in telephone number livery \n Initially booking was by telephone only, with all of the airline's aircraft painted with the booking telephone number. There is no incentive for  travel agents  to book flights on the airline because it does not pay commissions, a standard practice for low cost carriers. [20] \n In December 1997, one of easyJet's design and adverting agencies suggested to Stelios Haji-Ioannou that he should consider trialling a website for direct bookings. Haji-Ioannou's reply was \"The Internet is for nerds, it will never make money for my business!\". Other executives of the airline saw the potential and approved a website trial involving putting a different telephone reservations number on the website, to track success. Once Haji-Ioannou saw the results he changed his mind and an e-commerce website capable of offering real-time online booking went live in April 1998\u2014the first such website for a low cost carrier in Europe. [20] [69] [70] \n In December 2001, the airline switched from a third-party reservation system to an in-house system. [71]  Internet bookings were priced cheaper than booking by telephone, to reflect the reduced  call centre  costs; and the aircraft were repainted with the web address. Within a year over 50% of bookings were made using the website; by April 2004 the figure had jumped to 98%. [20] \n Cabin and onboard services [ edit ] \neasyJet Airbus A319 cabin \n easyJet's aircraft cabins are configured in a single class, high density layout. [72] \n The airline's main fleet, comprising Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft, carry up to 156 and 180/186 passengers respectively, depending on layout. A typical Airbus A319 carries approximately 140 passengers in a single class configuration, but as the airline does not serve meals on its shorter flights, it opted for smaller galleys and had a  lavatory  installed in unused space at the rear of the aircraft. The space saved by having smaller galleys allowed for the installation of 156 seats. Due to this seating arrangement, to satisfy safety requirements the airline's Airbus A319 aircraft have two pairs of overwing exits, instead of the standard one-pair configuration found on most Airbus A319 aircraft. [62] [73] [74] \n EasyJet does not provide complimentary meals or drinks on its flights (except for some occasional charter flights operated by the airline). Passengers may purchase items on board from the \"easyJet Bistro\"  buy on board  programme. [75]  Onboard sales are an important part of the airline's  ancillary revenue ; gifts such as fragrances, cosmetics, gadgets and easyJet-branded items are sold on board, as well as tickets for airport transfer services or train tickets. The airline's monthly  inflight magazine  is called  The Traveller . [76] \n The airline had previously provided in-flight entertainment (IFE) in some aircraft (the ex GB Airways fleet), using drop-down screens on some Airbus aircraft; IFE has now been discontinued. The airline offers headphones for purchase, along with a travel pillow and eyeshades, subject to stock. \n Frequent flyer, business travel, and loyalty products [ edit ] \n Three distinct loyalty products are offered, tailored towards business and frequent flyers. These are Flexi Fare, easyJet Plus and a new frequent traveller loyalty programme called Flight Club. Flexi Fare [77]  is a type of ticket that is usually more expensive than the regular fare and comparable to a business ticket with other airlines. This ticket offers additional flexibility, including unlimited free date changes within a set period, free route changes, complimentary checked baggage (1x20kg), an increased carry-on baggage allowance, and a \u00a35 on board refreshment voucher. easyJet Plus is an annual subscription product targeted at frequent flyers, [78]  both business and leisure. This service offers free allocated seating (including extra legroom), priority check-in, fast track security, speedy boarding and extra cabin baggage. The airline's loyalty programme is called Flight Club. [79]  To qualify for this a person must have flown at least twenty times or spent over \u00a31500 on ten flights within 12 months. Benefits include fee-free flight changes, free name changes, and a dedicated contact centre team. \n easyJet Hotels and easyJet Holidays [ edit ] \n On 14 December 2004, easyJet and Hotelopia, a subsidiary of  First Choice Holidays , launched the co-branded easyJetHotels accommodation booking service. easyJetHotels offers accommodation products throughout the airline's network. Customers booking flights through the airline's website are provided with quotes for a number of hotels at their destination. Alternatively, customers can book accommodation separately at the easyJetHotels website. [80] [81] \n On 28 June 2007, the airline expanded its relationship with Hotelopia by launching easyJetHolidays, which offers Travel Trust Association protected  package holidays  made up of easyJet flights and Hotelopia accommodation products. [82] [83] \n On 6 November 2010, the airline started a venture with Low Cost Travel Group, to offer flights dynamically packaged with Low Cost Travel Group's accommodation through the easyJet Holidays website. As of March 2011, easyJet Holidays has provided holidays and city breaks to all of the airline's routes. [84] \n Sponsorship [ edit ] \n The airline sponsored  Luton Town F.C.  from the 2009\u201310 season to the end of 2015\u201316 season. [85]  The airline and  Manchester Airport  have also jointly sponsored  Manchester Pride  in 2013 and 2014.
