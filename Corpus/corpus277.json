This suggests a need to consider transitioning to direct pay  arrangements, where the investor directly pays the dealer\u2019s compensation. \n \u201cTo address the  investor protection and market efficiency issues that have been raised  regarding embedded commissions, we believe that transitioning to direct pay  arrangements must be considered and evaluated,\u201d said Louis Morisset, CSA Chair  and President and CEO of the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers. \u201cThis is a  consultation process, and we are mindful of the need to carefully assess  potential impacts before making a decision.\u201d  \n Given the broad  potential impacts of the policy option discussed in the Consultation Paper, the  CSA is holding a longer than normal comment period.\u00a0 The CSA welcomes feedback on the Consultation  Paper, which includes 36 consultation questions. Comments should be submitted  in writing on or before June 9, 2017.  \n Some CSA members  also plan to hold in-person consultations in 2017 to facilitate additional  feedback. The CSA will consider the feedback it receives through both the  written comment process and in-person consultations before deciding on an  appropriate policy response. \u00a0 \n The CSA, the  council of the securities regulators of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories,  co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets. \n - 30 - \n Backgrounder \n For more information: \n Alison Walker \n            British Columbia Securities Commission \n            604-899-6713   \n Kristen\n            Rose \n            Ontario Securities Commission \n            416-593-2336 \n Nicole Tuncay\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n            Alberta Securities Commission \n            403-297-4008\u00a0  \n Jason (Jay) Booth \n            Manitoba Securities Commission \n            204-945-1660 \n Jane Anderson\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n            Nova Scotia Securities Commission \n            902-424-0179\u00a0  \n Andrew\n            Nicholson \n            Financial and Consumer Services \n            Commission, New Brunswick \n            506-658-3021\n  John O\u2019Brien \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            Newfoundland and Labrador \n            709-729-4909  \n            Janice Callbeck \n            Office of the Superintendent of\n            Securities \n            P.E.I \n            902-368-6288\n Jeff Mason \n            Nunavut Securities Office \n            867-975-6591 \n            Rhonda Horte \n            Office of the Yukon Superintendent \n            of Securities \n            867-667-5466\n Shannon McMillan \n            Financial and Consumer Affairs \n            Authority of Saskatchewan \n            306-798-4160  \n Tom\n            Hall \n            Northwest Territories Securities Office \n            867-767-9305\n Sylvain Th\u00e9berge \n            Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers \n            514-940-2176  \n \u00a0 \n Contact  | \n                                     Legal  |\n                                     Legislation  |\n                                     Accessibility  |\n                                     Fran\u00e7ais \n \u00a9 Ontario Securities Commission 2017 \n Government of Ontario \n JavaScript is disabled or not supported by this browser.
