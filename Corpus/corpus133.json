The first phase began in 2003 to develop both the outdoor and indoor Loyola Campus recreation and athletics facilities. Artificial surfaces were installed to create two new outdoor playing fields for football, soccer, rugby, and recreational activities. Permanent lighting was installed to permit evening practices and games, and temporary stands were erected to replace badly deteriorating stadium seating. The Ed Meagher Arena lockers and rink refrigeration system were renovated in 2014. Fundraising is underway to extend and renovate other parts of the ageing 1967 Sports Complex. The plans include: \n a new weight room and conditioning room facilities \n an athletic therapy centre \n academic and administrative support spaces \n recreational and varsity locker room space \n stadium construction to include permanent seating for 5,000 \n Visit the Stingers.ca website. \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
