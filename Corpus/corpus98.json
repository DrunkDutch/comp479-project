This year's Beta Gamma Sigma inductees from Concordia's John Molson School of Business have certainly earned that title. \nConcordia University's John Molson School of Business congratulates the students who have earned invitations to join the distinct organization. While almost 300,000 students receive bachelors or masters degrees in business each year, only about 20,000 are inducted into lifetime membership in Beta Gamma Sigma. Only students who rank in the top five percent of the junior class, the top 10 percent of the senior class and the top 20 percent of the PhD, Master's and Graduate Diploma programs at schools accredited by AACSB International - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business - are eligible for an invitation to membership. \n Beta Gamma Sigma was founded as a national organization in 1913. Its mission is to encourage and honour academic achievement and personal excellence in the study and practice of business. The Society endeavours to foster in its members an enduring commitment to the principles and values of Beta Gamma Sigma: honour and integrity, pursuit of wisdom and earnestness. \n Beta Gamma Sigma membership has become a truly international honour. With the expansion of accreditation by AACSB International, membership is no longer limited to those who have studied in the U.S. or Canada. These outstanding Concordia students are now eligible for the highest recognition a business student anywhere in the world can receive in an undergraduate or masters program at a school accredited by AACSB International. \n List of students previously initiated into the Concordia University Chapter of Beta Gamma Sigma: \n 2016 \n 2015 \n 2014 \n 2013 \n 2012 \n 2011 \n 2010 \n 2009 \n 2008 \n 2007 \n 2006 \n 2005 \n 2004 \n 2003 \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About JMSB \n Programs \n Research \n Services & facilities \n Student life \n News & events \n Future students \n Current students \n Employers \n Organizations \n Alumni \n John Molson School of Business \n1450 Guy St. \nMontreal, Quebec, Canada\u00a0 \n H3H 0A1 \n See campus map \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
