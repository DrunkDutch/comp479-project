Alternatively known as  Bhedav\u0101da ,  Tattvav\u0101da  and  Bimbapratibimbav\u0101da , Dvaita Vedanta sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar  Madhvacharya . [1]  The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that  God  (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls ( j\u012bv\u0101tman ) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct. The Dvaita school contrasts with the other two major sub-schools of Vedanta, the  Advaita Vedanta  of  Adi Shankara  which posits  nondualism  \u2013 that ultimate reality ( Brahman ) and human soul are identical and all reality is interconnected oneness, and  Vishishtadvaita  of  Ramanuja  which posits qualified nondualism \u2013 that ultimate reality ( Brahman ) and human soul are different but with the potential to be identical. [2] [3] \n Dvaita  (\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924) is a Sanskrit word that means \"duality, dualism\". [4]  The term refers to any premise, particularly in theology on the temporal and the divine, where two principles (truths) or realities are posited to exist simultaneously and independently.

The first and the only independent reality (svatantra-tattva), states the Dvaita school, is that of  Vishnu  as Brahman. [5]  Vishnu is the supreme  Self , in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions. [6]  The second reality is that of dependent (asvatantra-tattva) but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul, matter, and the like exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy, as opposed to monistic  Advaita Vedanta , is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe. [7] \n Like  Ramanuja , Madhvacharya also embraced  Vaishnavism . Madhvacharya posits God as being  personal  and  saguna , that is endowed with attributes and qualities. To Madhvacharya, the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas was Vishnu. He stated \" brahma\u015babda\u015bca Vi\u1e63\u1e47aveva \", that Brahman can only refer to  Vishnu . To him, Vishnu was not just any other  deva , but rather the one and only  Supreme Being . [8] [9] \n Dvaita Vedanta acknowledges two principles; however, it holds one of them (the sentient) as being eternally dependent on the other. The individual souls are depicted as reflections, images or shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine.  Moksha  (liberation) therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme. [5] \n Five fundamental, eternal and real differences are described in Dvaita school: [5] [9] [10] \n Between the individual souls (or j\u012bv\u0101tman) and God ( Brahm\u0101tme\u015bvara  or Vishnu). \n Between matter (inanimate, insentient) and God. \n Between individual souls (j\u012bv\u0101tman) \n Between matter and j\u012bvatman. \n Between various types of matter. \n These five differences are said to explain the nature of the universe. The world is called  prapa\u00f1ca  ( pa\u00f1ca  \"five\") by the Dvaita school for this reason. \n Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of  eternal damnation . For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls,  mukti-yogyas , qualifies for liberation, another, the  nitya-samsarins , subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class,  tamo-yogyas , who are condemned to eternal  hell  ( andhatamasa ). [11]  No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths. \n Influence [ edit ] \n Dvaita Vedanta and  Madhvacharya 's historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer, has been salutary, but not extensive. [12] \n According to Sharma, the influence of Dvaita Vedanta ideas have been most prominent on the Chaitanya school of  Bengal  Vaishnavism, [13]  and in  Assam . [14] \n Madhva's theology influenced later scholars such as  Nimbarka ,  Vallabha Acharya  and  Chaitanya Mahaprabhu . B.N.K. Sharma notes that Nimbarka's theology is a loose  r\u00e9chauff\u00e9  of Madhva's in its most essential aspects. \n Dvaita Vedanta's discussion of the eternal differences and the gradation between the concept of God, human beings and the observed nature led some early colonial-era Indologists such as  George Abraham Grierson  to suggest that its founder, the 13th-century Madhva was influenced by  Christianity , [12]  but later scholars rejected this theory.
