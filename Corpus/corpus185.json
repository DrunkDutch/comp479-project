Even if you pay by bank card or transfer still ask your landlord for a reciept. If they do not have a way of offering you one then you can use this generator to create your own.\u00a0 \n http://www.rentreceipt.net/ \n Remember if you don't have proof you paid it's like you never did. Landlords can and do take advantage of tenants this way. Know your rights so that you can better protect yourself.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n HOJO Articles \n   Finding Work Off Campus   \n   Finding an On-campus Part-Time Job at Concordia   \n   Protecting your Privacy   \n   Temporary Accomodation   \n   How to deal with Frozen Pipes   \n   Bed Bugs   \n   Looking for an Internship?   \n   Did you receive a Rental Increase letter from your landlord?   \n   Students and Employment   \n   Off-Campus Safety   \n   Neighbourhoods in Montreal   \n   Fraud Prevention   \n   Cockroaches   \n   6 simple ways to get ready for winter    \n   Apartment Search Tools   \n \u2039 previous \n 2 of 3 \n next \u203a \n \u200b   \n Quick Links \n Login \n Resources \n Jobs \n Contact Information \n Downtown:\u00a01455 de Maisonneuve Blvd West,\u00a0H-711\u00a0Montr\u00e9al, QC H3G 1M8 \n Loyola:\u00a07141 Sherbrooke Street West, CC-426\u00a0Montr\u00e9al,\u00a0QC\u00a0H4B 1R6 \n Phone -\u00a0514 848-7474 | Fax: 514 848-7450 \n Email -\u00a0 contactus@csu.qc.ca \n Concordia Student Union | Copyright 2016\u00a0|\u00a0All Rights Reserved"}
