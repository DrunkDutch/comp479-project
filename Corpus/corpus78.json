The research skills that I developed through the MA projects in various sub-fields of economics have been necessary for conducting unbiased market research and for delivering competitive analysis. Moreover, the theoretical background that I gained in economics is vital for modelling, forecasting and interpreting real industry data. \n What do you value most from your Economics experience? \n What I value most would be the continuous learning environment that exists and the professors\u2019 willingness to motivate their students into producing research. The program is demanding, but the professors were always willing to answer my questions and provide me with all the necessary tools I needed to conduct my research. This mentorship has supported my academic and professional growth.\u00a0 \n Is there a particular memory that stands out from your time at Concordia? \n The whole co-op internship experience was the highlight of my studies at Concordia. The day I got offered an internship at one of the leading manufacturing companies in the aviation sector was especially memorable. This job offer made me realize that all the knowledge that I had acquired from the master\u2019s degree and the transferable skills of time management, organization, research and critical thinking that I had developed during my studies were of utmost importance in building my future career.\u00a0\u00a0 \n What advice would you give to someone considering graduate studies in Economics? \n If you have a passion for the field of economics and you are curious about how economies, markets and businesses work and react to their environments\u2019 changes, definitely consider Concordia\u2019s Economics program. In this setting, you will be able to expand your horizons and develop skills that are vital for professional and academic growth. Choose the program in combination with the co-op internship program in order to maximize the benefits of this experience. You\u2019ll be getting the opportunity to apply your skills in a professional setting and gain valuable work experience. Overall, be prepared to work hard and you will definitely succeed and grow. \n Alumni profiles Carlos A.
