Agamas exist in Hinduism as well. 'Agama' is a Sanskrit word. The discourse delivered in a  samavasarana  (divine preaching hall) is called  \u015ahrut Jn\u0101na  and comprises eleven  angas  and fourteen  purvas . [1]  The discourse is recorded by  Ganadharas  (chief disciples), and is composed of twelve  angas  (departments). It is generally represented by a tree with twelve branches. [2]  This forms the basis of the Jaina  Agamas  or canons. These are believed to have originated from  Rishabhanatha , the first  tirthankara . [3] \n The earliest versions of Jain Agamas known were composed in  Ardhamagadhi Prakrit .  Agama  is a  Sanskrit  word which signifies the 'coming' of a body of doctrine by means of transmission through a lineage of authoritative teachers.

These scriptures are said to have contained the most comprehensive and accurate description of every branch of learning that one needs to know. [5]  The knowledge contained in these scriptures was transmitted orally by the teachers to their disciple saints  Digambara  sect of Jainism maintains that the  Agamas  were lost during the same famine that the  purvas  were lost in. [6]  According to the  Digambaras ,  \u0100ch\u0101rya  Bhutabali  was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. Later on, some learned  \u0100ch\u0101ryas  started to restore, compile and put into written words the teachings of Lord Mahavira, that were the subject matter of  Agamas . [7]   \u0100ch\u0101rya Dharasena , in first century CE, guided two  \u0100ch\u0101ryas ,  \u0100ch\u0101rya Pushpadanta  and  \u0100ch\u0101rya Bhutabali , to put these teachings in the written form. The two  \u0100ch\u0101ryas  wrote, on palm leaves,  \u1e62a\u1e6dkha\u1e45\u1e0d\u0101gama - among the oldest known Digambara Jaina texts. This was about 683 years after the  nirvana  of Mahavira. \n While some authors date the composition of Jain Agamas starting from the 6th century BCE, [8]  noted Indologist  Hermann Jacobi  holds that the composition of the Jaina siddhanta would fall somewhere about the end of the 4th or the beginning of the 3rd century BC. [9]  The general consensus amongst western scholars, such as Ian Whicher and David Carpenter, is that the earliest portions of Jain siddhanta were composed around the 4th or 3rd century BCE. [10] [11]  This may not be in agreement with Jain tradition according to which the  agamic  literature and the  Purvas  were passed from one heads of the order to his disciples for around 170 years after the  nirvana  of Mahavira. However, with time, it became difficult to keep the entire Jain literature committed to memory. In the 3rd century BCE,  Chandragupta Maurya  was the ruler of  Magadha  and  Bhadrabahu , (the last knower of complete Jain  agamas ) was the head of  Jain community . Predicting a 12 year long famine, Bhadrabahu went south to  Karnataka  with his adherents [12]  and  Sthulabhadra , another Jain monk remained behind. During this time the knowledge of the doctrine was getting lost. A council was formed at  Pataliputra  where eleven scriptures called  Angas  were compiled and the remnant of fourteen purvas were written down in 12th Anga, Ditthivaya by the adherents of Sthulbhadra. Due to the twelve years of famine it was extremely difficult for the Jain ascetics to preserve the entire canonical literature. The  Purvas  or the ancient texts were already forgotten and lost after the famine. According to  Svetambara  tradition, the agamas were collected on the basis of collective memory of the ascetics in the first council of Pataliputra under the stewardship of  Sthulibhadra  in around to 463\u2013367 BC. [13] \n In 453 or 466 CE that the  Vallabhi  council of the Svetambara Jain monks recompiled the Agamas and recorded them as written manuscripts under the leadership of Acharya Shraman Devardhigani along with other 500 Jain scholars. The existing Svetambara texts are based on the  Vallabhi  council texts. Digambaras reject the authority of the  Agamas  compiled at Valabhi. [14] \n Angas [ edit ] \nTable showing  Anga scriptures \n The knowledge of  Shruta-Jnana , may be of things which are contained in the  Angas  (Limbs or sacred Jain books) or of things outside the Angas. [15] \n The Agamas were composed of the following forty-six texts: [14] \n Twelve  Ang\u0101s \n \u0100c\u0101ranga s\u016btra \n S\u016btrakrtanga \n Sth\u0101n\u0101nga \n Samav\u0101y\u0101nga \n Vy\u0101khy\u0101praj\u00f1apti or Bhagavati s\u016btra \n Jn\u0101trdh\u0101rmakath\u0101h \n Up\u0101sakada\u015b\u0101h \n Antakrddaa\u015b\u0101h \n Anuttaraupap\u0101tikada\u015b\u0101h \n Pra\u015bnavy\u0101karanani \n Vip\u0101ka\u015bruta \n Drstiv\u0101da  (now extinct) \n Six  Chedas\u016btras  (Texts relating to the conduct and behaviour of monks and nuns)\n \u0100c\u0101rada\u015b\u0101h \n Brhatkalpa \n Vyavah\u0101ra \n Ni\u015b\u012btha \n Mah\u0101ni\u015b\u012btha \n J\u012btakalpa \n Four  M\u016blas\u016btras  (Scriptures which provide a base in the earlier stages of the monkhood)\n Da\u015bavaik\u0101lika \n Uttar\u0101dhyayana \n \u0100va\u015byaka \n Pindaniryukyti \n Ten  Prak\u012brnaka s\u016btras  (Texts on Independent or miscellaneous subjects)\n Catuh\u015barana \n \u0100turapraty\u0101khyan\u0101 \n Bhaktaparij\u00f1\u0101 \n Samst\u0101raka \n Tandulavaicarika \n Candravedhy\u0101ka \n Devendrastava \n Ganividy\u0101 \n Mah\u0101praty\u0101khyan\u0101 \n V\u012brastava \n Two  C\u016blikas\u016btras  (The scriptures which further enhance or decorate the meaning of Angas)\n Nand\u012b-s\u016btra \n Anuyogadv\u0101ra-s\u016btra \n Jain literature [ edit ] \n Main article:  Jain literature \n The  digambaras  maintain that original  agamas  were lost and knowledge of only one  anga  is available. The most authoritative  Jain text  accepted both by Digambara and Svetamberas is  Tattvartha Sutra . It is the first Jain scripture written in the  Sanskrit  language. [16]  Other Sanskrit Jain literature includes  \u015br\u0101vak\u0101c\u0101ra s such as the  Ratnakaranda \u015br\u0101vak\u0101c\u0101ra . [ citation needed ] \n Digambaras group texts into four literary categories called 'exposition' ( anuyoga ). [17]  The 'first' ( prathma ) exposition contains Digambara versions of the Universal History; the 'calculation' ( karana ) exposition contains works on cosmology; the 'behaviour' ( charana ) exposition includes texts about proper behaviour for monks and lay people. [17] \n Languages of Aagams [ edit ] \n Main article:  Languages of Jain literature \n The  Jain  literature includes both religious texts and books on generally secular topics such as sciences, history, and grammar. The Jains have used several languages at different times and in different regions of India. The earliest versions of Jain Agamas known were written in Ardhamagadhi  Prakrit  language. [14] [18] [19] [20] \n Prakrit \n Prakrit literature  includes the Aagams, Aagam-tulya texts, and Siddhanta texts. The dialect used to compose many of these texts is referred to as  Jain Prakrit . Composition in Prakrits ceased around the 10th century AD. \n Tamil \n Some of the early Tamil classics such as  Valayapathi ,  Silappatikaram  and  Civaka Chintamani  are Jain or Jain-affiliated works. \n Importance [ edit ] \n For Jains, their scriptures represent the literal words of  Mah\u0101v\u012bra  and the other fordmakers only to the extent that the Agama is a series of beginning-less, endless and fixed truths, a tradition without any origin, human or divine, which in this world age has been channelled through  Sudharma , the last of Mahavira's disciples to survive.
