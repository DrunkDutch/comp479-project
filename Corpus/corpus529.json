It is the United Kingdom's only island city and has a population of 205,400. The city forms part of the  South Hampshire built-up area , which also covers Southampton and the towns of  Havant ,  Waterlooville ,  Eastleigh ,  Fareham , and  Gosport . \n The city's history can be traced to  Roman times . A significant naval port for centuries, Portsmouth has the world's oldest  dry dock  and was England's first line of defence during the  French invasion  in 1545. Special  Palmerston Forts  were built in 1859 in anticipation of another invasion from continental Europe. By the early-19th century, Portsmouth was the most heavily  fortified  city in the world, and was considered \"the world's greatest naval port\" at the height of the  British Empire  throughout  Pax Britannica . The world's first mass  production line  was set up in the city, making it the most industrialised site in the world. During the  Second World War , the city was a pivotal embarkation point for the  D-Day landings  and was bombed extensively in the  Portsmouth Blitz , which resulted in the deaths of 930 people. In 1982, a large proportion of the task force dispatched to liberate the  Falkland Islands  deployed from the city's naval base.  Her Majesty's Yacht  Britannia  left the city to oversee the  transfer of Hong Kong  in 1997, which marked for many the end of the empire. \n Portsmouth is one of the world's best known ports.  HMNB Portsmouth  is considered to be the home of the  Royal Navy  and is home to two-thirds of the UK's surface fleet. The city is home to some famous ships, including  HMS  Warrior , the Tudor  carrack   Mary Rose  and  Horatio Nelson's  flagship,  HMS  Victory  (the world's oldest naval ship still in commission). The former  HMS  Vernon  naval shore establishment  has been redeveloped as a retail park known as  Gunwharf Quays . Portsmouth is among the few British cities with two cathedrals: the  Anglican Cathedral of St Thomas  and the  Roman Catholic   Cathedral of St John the Evangelist . The waterfront and  Portsmouth Harbour  are dominated by the  Spinnaker Tower , one of the  United Kingdom's tallest structures  at 560 feet (170\u00a0m). Nearby  Southsea  is a seaside resort with a  pier  amusement park and medieval  castle . \n Portsmouth F.C. , the city's professional  football  club, play their home games at  Fratton Park . The city has several mainline railway stations that connect to  London Waterloo  amongst other lines in southern England.  Portsmouth International Port  is a commercial cruise ship and ferry port for international destinations. The port is the second busiest in the United Kingdom after  Dover , handling around three million passengers a year. The city formerly had its own airport,  Portsmouth Airport , until its closure in 1973. The  University of Portsmouth  enrols 23,000 students and is ranked among the world's best modern universities. Portsmouth is also the birthplace of author  Charles Dickens  and engineer  Isambard Kingdom Brunel . \n Contents \n 1   History \n 1.1   Early history \n 1.2   Norman to Tudor \n 1.3   Stuart to Georgian \n 1.4   Industrial Revolution to Victorian \n 1.5   Edwardian to Second World War \n 1.6   Post-war \n 2   Geography \n 2.1   Climate \n 3   Demography \n 4   Government and politics \n 5   Economy \n 6   Culture \n 6.1   Literature \n 7   Education \n 8   Landmarks \n 9   Gunwharf Quays \n 10   Southsea \n 11   Religion \n 12   Sport \n 13   Transport and communications \n 14   Media \n 15   Notable residents \n 16   See also \n 17   Notes \n 18   References \n 18.1   Bibliography \n 19   External links \n History [ edit ] \n Main article:  History of Portsmouth \n Early history [ edit ] \n The  Romans  built  Portus Adurni , a  fort , at nearby  Portchester  in the late third century. [4]  The city's  Old English  name \"Portesmu\u00f0a\" is derived from  port , meaning a haven, and  mu\u00f0a , the mouth of a large river or estuary. [5]  It was mentioned in an  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  entry for the year 501: \n Her cwom Port on Bretene 7 his .ii. suna Bieda 7 M\u00e6gla mid .ii. scipum on \u00fe\u00e6re stowe \u00fee is gecueden Portesmu\u00fea 7 ofslogon anne giongne brettiscmonnan, swi\u00fee \u00e6\u00feelne monnan. [a] [6] \n This was reaffirmed in  Winston Churchill 's book  A History of the English-Speaking Peoples , which relates the story that Portsmouth was founded by Port, the pirate. [7] [8] \n The south coast was vulnerable to  Danish Viking  invasions during the 8th and 9th centuries. In 787, it was assaulted and conquered by Danish pirates, [9]  and then during the reign of  \u00c6thelwulf , King of  Wessex  in 838, a Danish fleet landed between Portsmouth and Southampton and the surrounding area was plundered. [10]  In response, \u00c6thelwulf sent Wulfherd and the governor of  Dorsetshire  to confront the Danes at Portsmouth, where most of their ships were docked. They were successful although Wulfherd was killed. [10]  In 1001, the Danes returned and pillaged Portsmouth and surrounding locations, threatening the English with extinction. [11] [12]  The Danes were massacred by the survivors the following year and rebuilding began, although the town suffered further attacks until 1066. [13] \n Norman to Tudor [ edit ] \nThe  Round Tower  was built in 1418 to defend the entrance to  Portsmouth Harbour . \n Portsmouth was not mentioned in the  Domesday Survey  of 1086, but  Bocheland  ( Buckland ),  Copenore  ( Copnor ), and  Frodentone  ( Fratton ) were. [14]  Some sources maintain it was founded in 1180 by the Anglo-Norman merchant  Jean de Gisors . [15] \n When King  Henry II  died in 1189, his son  Richard I , who had spent most of his life in France, arrived in Portsmouth before he was crowned in London. [16]  When Richard returned from captivity in  Austria  in May 1194, he summoned a fleet of 100 ships and an army to the port. [17]  He granted the town a  Royal charter , giving permission for an annual fifteen-day free market fair, weekly markets, and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from paying an annual tax of \u00a318. [14] [18]  Richard granted the town the arms of  Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus , whom he had defeated during the  Third Crusade  in 1191, reflecting a significant involvement of local soldiers, sailors, and vessels in the holy war. [19]  The 800 anniversary was celebrated in 1994 as the city's founding [20] . \n King John  reaffirmed the rights and privileges awarded by Richard \u00a0 I and established the permanent naval base. The first docks were built by  William of Wrotham  beginning in 1212. [14] [17]  John summoned his earls, barons, and military advisers to the town to plan an invasion of  Normandy . [21]  In 1229, after a declaration of war against France,  Henry \u00a0 III  assembled a force described as \"one of the finest armies that had ever been raised in England\" by historian Lake Allen. [22]  The invasion stalled and returned from France in October 1231. [23]  In 1242 Henry \u00a0 III summoned troops to invade  Guienne , and in 1295  Edward \u00a0 I  sent supplies for his army in France. [24]  By the following century, commercial interests had grown and its exports included wool, corn, grain, and livestock. [25] \n Edward II  ordered all ports on the south coast to assemble their largest vessels at Portsmouth to carry soldiers and horses to the  Duchy of Aquitaine  in 1324 to strengthen defences. [26]  In 1336 a French fleet under the command of  David II of Scotland  attacked the  English Channel , ransacked the  Isle of Wight  and threatened the town. Concerned,  Edward \u00a0 III  instructed all maritime towns to build vessels and raise troops to rendezvous at Portsmouth. [26]  Two years later, a French fleet led by  Nicholas B\u00e9huchet   raided Portsmouth , destroying much of the town. Only the stone-built church and hospital survived. [27] [28]  After the raid, Edward \u00a0 III exempted the town from national taxes to aid reconstruction. [29]  Upon Edward \u00a0 III's death in 1377, his grandson  Richard \u00a0 II  was crowned, and the French landed in Portsmouth in the same year. The town was plundered and burnt, but its inhabitants fought back and defeated them, which led the French to retreat and raid towns in the  West Country  instead. [30] \nA map of Portsmouth in around 1540. \n Henry V  built the first permanent  fortifications of Portsmouth . In 1416, a number of French ships blockaded Portsmouth, which housed ships that were set to invade Normandy. Instead, Henry gathered a fleet at Southampton and invaded the Norman coast in August of that year. [31]  Recognising the town's growing importance, he ordered a wooden  Round Tower  to be built at the mouth of the harbour, which was completed in 1426. [32]   Henry VII  rebuilt the fortifications with stone, assisted Robert Brygandine and Sir  Reginald Bray  in the construction of the world's first  dry dock , [33]  and raised the  Square Tower  in 1494. [32]  During his reign, Henry \u00a0 VII made Portsmouth a Royal Dock, and was England's only dockyard to be considered \"national\" at the time. [34]  Although  King Alfred  may have used Portsmouth to build ships as early as the 9th century, the first warship recorded as constructed in the town was the  Sweepstake , built in the dry dock in 1497. [35] \n In 1539,  Henry VIII  built  Southsea Castle , financed by the  Dissolution of the Monasteries , in anticipation of a French invasion. [36] [37]  He also invested large sums of money into the town's dockyard, and expanded its boundaries to 8 acres (3.2\u00a0ha). [38]  Around this time a Tudor  defensive boom  stretched from the Round Tower to Fort Blockhouse in Gosport, as a protection to Portsmouth Harbour. [39] \n In 1545, from Southsea Castle, he witnessed his flagship  Mary Rose  sink with the loss of about 500 lives, whilst going into action against the French fleet in the  Battle of the Solent . [40]  Some historians believe that the  Mary Rose  turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports, whereas others argue that it sank due to its poor design. [41]  Over the years, Portsmouth's fortifications were rebuilt and improved by successive monarchs. In 1563, Portsmouth suffered from an outbreak of a  plague , resulting in about 300 deaths out of the town's population of 2000. [15] \n Stuart to Georgian [ edit ] \nView of  Old Portsmouth  from the  Spinnaker Tower \n In 1623,  Charles I  (then Prince of Wales) returned to Portsmouth from his travels in France and Spain. [42]  Five years later, Charles' unpopular military adviser,  George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham , was stabbed to death in an  Old Portsmouth  pub by war veteran  John Felton . [14] [43]  Felton never attempted to escape and was caught walking through the streets when soldiers confronted him, to which he responded: \"I know that he is dead, for I had the force of forty men when I struck the blow\". [44]  Felton was then hanged, and his body was chained to a  gibbet  on  Southsea Common  as a warning to others. [15] [44]  The murder took place in the Greyhound public house on High Street, which is now private and called Buckingham House; it bears a commemorative plaque. [45] \n Most residents, including the mayor, supported the  parliamentarians  during the  English Civil War , although its military governor,  Colonel Goring , supported the  royalists . [15]  The town became a major base for the parliamentarian navy and was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to raid it by land in the  Siege of Portsmouth ; the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the royalist garrison in the town. Across the harbour, parliamentarians in  Gosport  joined in the assault, with their guns damaging  St Thomas's Church . [15] [46]  On 5 \u00a0 September 1642, the remaining royalists in the garrison at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened to blow it up with gunpowder. In return, he and his garrison were allowed safe passage. [46] [47] \n Under the  Commonwealth of England ,  Robert Blake  used the harbour as his base during the  First Anglo-Dutch War  in 1652 and the  Anglo Spanish War  of 1654. He died within sight of the town returning from  C\u00e1diz . [47]  After the end of the Civil War in 1646, Portsmouth was among the first towns to declare  Charles \u00a0 II  as king and subsequently began to prosper. [48]  In 1650, the first ship to be built for more than 100 years,  HMS  Portsmouth , was launched. Between 1650 and 1660, twelve ships were built. After the  restoration of Monarchy , Charles \u00a0 II married  Catherine of Braganza  in the  Royal Garrison Church . [49] [50]  During the latter half of the 17th century the town continued to grow; a new wharf was constructed in 1663 for military use, and in 1665 a  mast  pond was dug out. In 1684 a list of ships docked in Portsmouth gave evidence of its increasing national importance; the town was the only place of naval rendezvous in England at the time. [51]  Between 1667 and 1685 the town's fortifications were rebuilt; new walls were constructed with  bastions  and two moats were dug, making Portsmouth one of the most heavily fortified places in the world. [15] \n In 1759, General  James Wolfe  sailed from the harbour to Canada on an ill-fated expedition to capture  Quebec . His body was brought back to Portsmouth in November that year and received the highest naval and military honours. [52]  Two years later, on 30 \u00a0 May 1775, Captain  James Cook  arrived on board  HMS \u00a0 Endeavour  after circumnavigating the world. [14] [53]  On 13 \u00a0 May 1787,  eleven ships left  to establish the first European colony in  Australia , marking the beginning of prisoner transportation, [54] [55]  and in the same year, Captain  William Bligh  of  HMS \u00a0 Bounty  set sail from the harbour. [14] [56]  After the  mutiny on the  Bounty  on 28 \u00a0 April 1789, the  HMS \u00a0 Pandora  was dispatched from Portsmouth to bring back the mutineers for trial. The court martial opened on 12 \u00a0 September 1792 on board the  HMS \u00a0 Duke  in Portsmouth Harbour\u00a0\u2013 of the remaining ten men, three were sentenced to death. [57] [58]  In 1789, a chapel was erected in Prince George's Street and was dedicated to  St John  by the Bishop of Winchester. Around this time, a  bill  was passed in the House of Commons regarding the creation of a canal to link Portsmouth to Chichester, but the project was abandoned. [59] \n The city's nickname Pompey is thought to have derived from the log entry \"Pom. \u00a0 P.\" (Portsmouth Point) made as ships entered the harbour. Navigational charts use the abbreviation. [60]  However, a historian argues that the name Pompey may have been brought back from a group of Portsmouth-based sailors who visited  Pompey's Pillar  in  Alexandria , Egypt, in around 1781. [61]  Another theory is that it is named after the harbour's guardship,  Pompee , a 74-gun French battleship captured in 1793. [62] \n The borough's coat of arms is attested in the early 19th century, as  Azure a crescent or, surmounted by an estoile of eight points of the last [63]  This design is apparently based on seals of the mayoralty used in the 18th century. [64] \n Industrial Revolution to Victorian [ edit ] \n HMS  Warrior  (launched in 1860) has been restored to its original Victorian condition. \n Marc Isambard Brunel  established the world's first mass production line at  Portsmouth Block Mills  making  pulley   blocks  for  rigging  on the navy's ships. [65]  The first machines were installed in January 1803 and the final set for large blocks in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks. [66]  By the turn of the 19th century, the town had the largest industrial site in the world with a workforce of 8000 and an annual budget of \u00a3570,000. [67] \n In 1805,  Admiral Nelson  left Portsmouth to command the fleet that defeated the Franco-Spanish at the  Battle of Trafalgar . [14]  Before departing, Nelson told the crew of the  HMS  Victory  and workers in the dockyard that \"England expects every man will do his duty\". [68]  The Royal Navy's reliance on Portsmouth led to it becoming the most fortified city in the world. [69]  A network of  Palmerston Forts  were built around the town as part of a programme led by Prime Minister  Lord Palmerston  to defend British military bases from an inland attack. The forts were nicknamed \"Palmerston's Follies\" due to the fact that their armaments were pointed inland and not out to sea. [70]  From 1808 the Royal Navy's  West Africa Squadron , tasked with stopping the slave trade, operated out of Portsmouth. [71] \n In April 1811 the Portsea Island Company constructed the first piped water supply [72]  to upper and middle class houses. [15]  It supplied water to approximately 4500 of the 14,000 houses, generating an income \u00a35000 a year. [72]  HMS  Victory ' s active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a  depot ship . The town of Gosport contributed \u00a375 a year towards the ship's maintenance. [68]  In 1818,  John Pounds  began teaching working class children in the country's first  ragged school . [73] [74]  In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout the town, [14]  followed by Old Portsmouth three years later. [15] \n During the 19th century, Portsmouth grew and expanded across Portsea Island. By the 1860s  Buckland  had been merged into the expanding town, and by the next decade  Fratton  and  Stamshaw  had also been incorporated. Between 1865 and 1870 the council built sewers after more than 800 people died in a  cholera  epidemic. A bylaw stated that any house within 100 feet (30\u00a0m) of a sewer had to be connected to it. [14]  By 1871 the population had risen to 100,000, [15]  although the national census at that time gave the population as 113,569. [14]  A working-class suburb was constructed in the 1870s when around 1,820 houses were built on land owned by a Mr \u00a0 Somers. The suburb became  Somerstown . [14]  Despite public health improvements, 514 people died in a  smallpox  epidemic in 1872. [14]  That year, on 21 \u00a0 December, the  Challenger  expedition  was launched from Portsmouth, embarking on a 68,890-nautical-mile (127,580\u00a0km) circumnavigation of the globe for scientific research. [75] [76] \n Edwardian to Second World War [ edit ] \n George VI  inspecting the crew of the  HNoMS  Draug  in Portsmouth during the Second World War \n At the turn of the 20th century, Portsmouth was considered \"the world's greatest naval port\" when the  British Empire  was at its height of power, covering a quarter of Earth's total land area and 458 million people. [77]  In 1900, Portsmouth Dockyard employed 8000 men \u00a0 \u2013 a figure which more than doubled to 23,000 people during the  First World War . [15] [78]  On 1 \u00a0 October 1916, Portsmouth was bombed by a  Zeppelin  airship. [79]  Although the  Oberste Heeresleitung  (German Supreme Army Command) stated that the town was \"lavishly bombarded with good results\", there were no reports of any bombs being dropped in the area. [80]  Another source asserted that the bombs were mistakenly dropped into the harbour rather than the dockyard. [79]  Throughout the war, around 1200 ships were refitted in the dockyard, making it one of the most strategic ports in the empire at the time. [78] \n Portsmouth was granted  city status  in 1926, following a long campaign by the borough council. The application was made on the grounds that it was the \"first naval port of the kingdom\". [81]  In 1929, the city council added the  motto  \"Heaven's Light Our Guide\" to the medieval coat of arms. Except for the celestial objects in the arms, the motto was that of the  Star of India , referring to the troopships bound for  British India  that left from the port. [82]  The crest and supporters are based on those of the  royal arms , but altered to show the city's maritime connections: the lions and unicorn have been given fish tails, and a  naval crown  placed around the unicorn. [82]  Around the unicorn is wrapped a representation of the Tudor defensive boom which stretched across Portsmouth Harbour. [39] \n During the  Second World War , the city, particularly the port, was bombed extensively by the  Luftwaffe  in the  Portsmouth Blitz . [14]  Between July 1940 and May 1944, the city was hit by 67 air raids which destroyed 6625 houses and severely damaged 6549 of them. [15]  The air raids caused 930 deaths and wounded almost 3000 people, [83] [84]  many of them in the dockyard and military establishments. [85]  On the night of the city's heaviest raid on 10 \u00a0 January 1941, the Luftwaffe dropped 140 tonnes of high explosive bombs, killing 171 people and leaving 3000 homeless. [86]  Many of the city's houses were damaged and areas of  Landport  and Old Portsmouth destroyed, with the future site of  Gunwharf Quays  being razed to the ground. [87]  On the same night, the  Guildhall  was hit by an incendiary bomb which burnt out the interior and destroyed its inner walls, [88]  although the civic plate was retrieved unharmed from the vault under the front steps. [83]  Following the heaviest raid on the city, Portsmouth's mayor, Sir Denis Daley, wrote in the  Evening News : \n We are bruised but we are not daunted, and we are still as determined as ever to stand side by side with other cities who have felt the blast of the enemy, and we shall, with them, persevere with an unflagging spirit towards a conclusive and decisive victory. \n \u2014\u2009 Sir Denis Daley, January 1941 [89] \n Portsmouth Harbour was a vital military embarkation point for the  D-Day landings  on 6 \u00a0 June 1944.  Southwick House , just to the north of the city, was the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, US General  Dwight D. Eisenhower . [90] [91]  On 15 \u00a0 July 1944 an experimental  V-1 flying bomb  hit Newcomen Road, killing 15 people. [15] \n Post-war [ edit ] \n Much of the city's housing stock was damaged during the war. The wreckage was cleared in an attempt to improve the quality of dwellings after the war, though before permanent accommodation could be built, Portsmouth City Council built  prefabs  for those who had lost their homes. Between 1945 and 1947, more than 700 prefab houses were constructed \u00a0 \u2013 some were erected over bomb sites. [15]  The first permanent houses were built away from the city centre to new developments such as  Paulsgrove  and  Leigh Park , [92] [93]  with construction of council estates in Paulsgrove being completed in 1953. In Leigh Park, the first housing estates were completed in 1949, though building work in the area continued until 1974. [15]  Developers still occasionally find  unexploded bombs  in the area, such as on the site of the destroyed Hippodrome theatre in 1984. [94]  Despite improvements made by the city council to build new accommodation, a survey made in 1955 concluded that 7000 houses in Portsmouth were unfit for human habitation. Following a controversial decision, a whole section of central Portsmouth, including Landport, Somerstown and Buckland, was demolished and replaced by council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The success of the project and the quality of the 70s homes are debatable. [15] \n Her Majesty's Yacht  Britannia  in Portsmouth Harbour during the 50th anniversary of the D-Day Landings in 1994. The masts of  HMS  Victory  can be seen in the background. \n Portsmouth was affected by the British Empire's decline in the latter half of the 20th century. Shipbuilding jobs fell from 46% of workforce in 1951 to 14% in 1966, drastically reducing the manpower in the dockyard. The city council attempted to create new work; an industrial estate was built in Fratton in 1948, and others were built at Paulsgrove and Farlington in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. [15]  Traditional industries such as brewing and corset making disappeared during this time, though electrical engineering became a major employer. Despite the cutbacks made to traditional sectors, Portsmouth still remained an attractive place for industry. In 1968,  Zurich Insurance Group  moved their UK headquarters to the city, with  IBM  relocating their European headquarters in 1979. [15]  The population of the city had dropped from approximately 200,000 to 177,142 by the end of the 1960s. [95]  In the early 1980s, then Defence Secretary  John Nott  concluded that of the four home dockyards, both Portsmouth and  Chatham  would be closed. However, Portsmouth City Council won a concession, and rather than face closure, the dockyard was downgraded to a naval base. [96] \n On 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded two British territories in the South Atlantic: the  Falkland Islands  and  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The British government's response was to dispatch a  naval task force , and on 5 \u00a0 April, the aircraft carriers  HMS  Hermes  and  HMS  Invincible  sailed from Portsmouth for the South Atlantic. The successful outcome of the war had reaffirmed Portsmouth's significance as a naval port and importance to the defence of British interests. [97]  In January 1997,  Her Majesty's Yacht  Britannia  embarked from the city on her final voyage to oversee the  transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong , which marked for many the end of the empire. [98] [99]  She was later decommissioned on 11 \u00a0 December that year at Portsmouth Naval Base in the presence of the Queen, the  Duke of Edinburgh , and twelve senior members of the Royal Family. [100] [101] \n In 2001, redevelopment of the  HMS  Vernon  naval shore establishment  began as a complex of retail outlets, clubs, pubs, and a large shopping centre known as Gunwharf Quays. [15]  In 2003, construction of the 552 feet (168\u00a0m) tall  Spinnaker Tower  began at Gunwharf Quays with sponsorship from the  National Lottery . [102]  In late 2004, the  Tricorn Centre , dubbed \"the ugliest building in the UK\" by the BBC, was demolished after years of debate over the expense of demolition, and controversy as to whether it was worth preserving as an example of 1960s  brutalist   architecture . [103] [104]  It was designed by  Owen Luder  as part of a project to \"revitalise\" Portsmouth in the 1960s, consisting of a shopping centre, market, nightclubs, and a  multi-storey car park . [105]  In 2005 the city celebrated the 200th anniversary of the  Battle of Trafalgar , with Queen  Elizabeth II  being present at a formal  fleet review  and a staged mock battle. [15]  The naval base continues to be home to two-thirds of the surface fleet. [106] \n Geography [ edit ] \nAerial view of Portsmouth and Portsmouth Harbour \n By road, Portsmouth lies 73.5 miles (118.3\u00a0km) from Central London, 49.5 miles (79.7\u00a0km) west of  Brighton , and 22.3 miles (35.9\u00a0km) east of  Southampton . [107]  Portsmouth is situated primarily on  Portsea Island  and is the United Kingdom's only island city, although parts of it have expanded onto the mainland in recent years. [108]   Gosport  forms a borough in its own right immediately to the west. [107]  The island is separated from the mainland by  Portsbridge Creek [109]  which is crossed by three road bridges (the  M275 motorway , the  A3 road , and the  A2030 road ), a railway bridge, and two footbridges. [110]  Portsea Island, which forms part of the  Hampshire Basin , [111]  is low-lying: the majority of its surface area on the island is less than 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft)  above sea level . [112] [113]  The highest natural elevation on Portsea Island is the road junction Kingston Cross, at 21 feet (6.4\u00a0m). [112] \n Old Portsmouth  forms the oldest part of the city in the south-west part of Portsea Island, and includes  Portsmouth Point  and the historic waterfront area known as Spice Island. [114]  The main channel entering Portsmouth Harbour, which lies to the west of Portsea Island, [109]  passes between Old Portsmouth and Gosport. [107]  Within Portsmouth Harbour are a series of lakes, including Fountain Lake near the harbour, Portchester Lake in the central south, Brick Kiln Lake and Tipner to the east, and Bombketch and Spider Lakes to the west. In the channel further to the northwest, around Portchester, are Wicor, Cams, and Great Cams Lakes. [107]  The large tidal bay of  Langstone Harbour  lies to the east of Portsea Island. In the northern part, off the coast of  Farlington , is the  Farlington Marshes , a 125-hectare (308-acre) grazing marsh and saline lagoon. One of the oldest  local reserves  in the county, built from reclaimed land in 1771, it provides an important habitat for migratory wildfowl and  waders . [115] \nPortsea Island and Hayling Island \n To the south of Portsmouth are the waters of  Spithead  and the wider  Solent , which connects Portsmouth Harbour and the  Isle of Wight . The southern waterfront of the city is dominated by a series of fortifications including the  Round Tower , the  Square Tower , and  Southsea Castle . [116]  The seaside resort of  Southsea  is situated to the south of Portsea Island, [117]  and to the east lies the area known as  Eastney . [118]  Eastney Lake covered nearly 170 acres (69 hectares) in 1626. [119]  To the north of Eastney is the residential district of  Milton  and an area of reclaimed land now known as Milton Common (formerly Milton Lake), [107]  described as a \"flat scrubby land with a series of freshwater lakes\". [120]  Further north on the east coast is the residential district of  Baffins , featuring Great Salterns recreation ground and golf course, which forms an area around  Portsmouth College . [107] \n The  Hilsea Lines  are a series of defunct fortifications on the north coast of the island which border Portsbridge Creek and the mainland. [121] [122]   Portsdown Hill  dominates the skyline in the northern part of the city, and contains several large  Palmerston Forts , [b]  such as  Fort Fareham ,  Fort Wallington ,  Fort Nelson ,  Fort Southwick ,  Fort Widley , and  Fort Purbrook .  [116] [123]  Portsdown Hill is formed by a large band of  chalk , while the rest of Portsea Island is composed of layers of  London Clay  and  sand  (part of the  Bagshot Formation ), formed principally during the late and early  Eocene  Epoch. [124] \n Northern areas of the city include  Stamshaw ,  Hilsea  and  Copnor ,  Cosham ,  Drayton ,  Farlington , and  Port Solent . [125]  Other districts in Portsmouth include  North End  and  Fratton . [126] [127]  The west of the city is mainly  council estates  such as  Buckland ,  Landport , and  Portsea . These were built to replace Victorian terraces destroyed by bombing in the Second World War. [15]  After the war the 2,000 acres (810\u00a0ha) estate of  Leigh Park  was built to solve the chronic housing shortage during the post-war reconstruction. [92]  Since the early 2000s the estate has been entirely under the jurisdiction of  Havant Borough Council , but Portsmouth City Council remains the landlord of these properties, making it the biggest landowner in Havant Borough. [93] \n The city's main station,  Portsmouth and Southsea railway station , [128]  is located in the city centre, close to the  Guildhall  and the Civic Offices. [83] [129]  Just to the south of the Guildhall is Guildhall Walk, a nightlife area with many pubs and clubs. [130]  Edinburgh Road contains the city's Roman Catholic cathedral and  Victoria Park , a 15 acres (6.1\u00a0ha) park which opened in 1878. [131] \nPanorama of Portsmouth from  Portsdown Hill .

During winter, frosts are light and short-lived and snow quite rare, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, as the city is surrounded by water and densely populated, and Portsdown Hill protects the city from cold northerly winds. [112]  The average maximum temperature in January is 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) with the average minimum being 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). The lowest temperature recorded is \u22128\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u00a0\u00b0F). [132]  In summer a temperature of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) can occasionally be attained, particularly in more sheltered spots. The average maximum temperature in July is 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F), with the average minimum being 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded is 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). [132]  As it is located on the coast in  South East England , the city receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. [133]  The city gets around 645 millimetres (25.4\u00a0in) of rain a year, with a minimum of 1\u00a0mm (0.04\u00a0in) of rain reported on 103 days a year.

[138] [139] [140] [141]  As of the  2011 census , the city had 205,400 residents. [138] [142]  This equates to 5,100 people living in every square kilometre (0.4 sq. \u00a0 mi.), which is eleven times more than the regional average of 440 people per square kilometre and more than London, which has 4,900 people per square kilometre. The city used to be even more densely populated, with the 1951 census showing a population of 233,545. [143] [144]  In a reversal of that decrease, the population of the city has been gradually increasing since the 1990s. [145]  With about 860,000 residents, the  South Hampshire built-up area  is the  fifth-largest urban area in England  and the largest in  South East England , forming the centre of one of the United Kingdom's  most populous metropolitan areas . [146] \n The city is predominantly white in terms of ethnicity, with 91.8% of the population belonging to this ethnic group. [147]  Portsmouth's long association with the  Royal Navy  means that it represents one of the most diverse cities in terms of the peoples of the British Isles. [148]  Similarly, some of the largest and most well-established non-white communities have their roots with the Royal Navy, most notably the large  Chinese  community, principally from  British Hong Kong . [148] [149]  Portsmouth's long industrial history in support of the Royal Navy has seen many people from across the British Isles move to Portsmouth to work in the factories and docks, the largest of these groups being Irish Catholics. [150] [c]  According to 2011 census, the ethnic breakdown of Portsmouth's population is as follows: 84.0%  White British , 3.8%  Other White , 1.3%  Chinese , 1.4%  Indian , 0.5%  Mixed-Race , 1.8%  Bangladeshi , 0.5%  Other ethnic group , 1.4%  Black African , 0.5%  White Irish , 1.3%  Other Asian , 0.3%  Pakistani , 0.3%  Black Caribbean  and 0.1%  Other Black .

Portsmouth was granted its first charter in 1194. [155]  In the early 20th century, the boundaries were extended to include the whole of Portsea Island; they were further extended in 1920 and 1932, taking in areas of the mainland and adjacent villages which included  Drayton  and  Farlington . [15] [156]  From 1 \u00a0 April 1974 it formed the second tier of local government below  Hampshire County Council ; [157]  however, Portsmouth, along with Southampton, became administratively independent of Hampshire with the creation of the unitary authority on 1 \u00a0 April 1997. [158]  The city is divided into two parliamentary constituencies,  Portsmouth South  and  Portsmouth North , represented in the  House of Commons  by, respectively,  Stephen Morgan  and  Penny Mordaunt , of the  Labour Party  and  Conservative  Members of Parliament. [159] \n The city council is made up of 42 councillors. After the  May 2014 local elections , the Conservatives formed a minority administration with just 12 \u00a0 councillors. [160]  The largest party within the council is the  Liberal Democrats  with 19 \u00a0 councillors (including the  Lord Mayor ). [161]  The other parties represented in council are the  UK Independence Party  (UKIP) and  Labour , with five and four Councillors, respectively. [161]  There are also two  independent  councillors, Eleanor Scott (elected as a Liberal Democrat) and Paul Godier (elected as UKIP). [162]  Councillors are returned from 14 \u00a0 wards, with each ward having three councillors [163]  and a four-year term. [164]  The leader of the council is the Conservative Donna Jones. [165]  The position of Lord Mayor of Portsmouth is usually held for a one-year period. [166] \n The council is based in the Civic Offices, which house departments such as tax support, housing benefits, resident services, and municipal functions. [167]  They are situated in Guildhall Square, along with  Portsmouth Guildhall  and Portsmouth Central Library. The Guildhall is a symbol of Portsmouth, serving principally as a cultural venue. It was designed by  Leeds -based architect  William Hill , who first started constructing it in the  neo-classical style  in 1873 at the cost of \u00a3140,000. [89] [168]  The Guildhall was opened to the public in 1890. [169] \n Economy [ edit ] \nPortsmouth Continental Ferry Port serves as one of the city's major industries. \n A tenth of the city's workforce is employed at  Portsmouth Naval Dockyard , which is directly linked to the city's biggest industry, defence, with the headquarters of  BAE Systems Surface Ships  located in the city. [170]  BAE's Portsmouth shipyard has been awarded a share of the construction work on the two new  Queen Elizabeth class  aircraft carriers , [171] [172]  with both aircraft carriers set to enter Portsmouth Harbour upon completion. [173]  A \u00a3100 million contract was signed to develop the facilities at Portsmouth that will be necessary to support the vessels. [173]  There is also a major ferry port that handles both passengers and cargo, [174]  and the city has a dedicated fishing fleet consisting of 20 to 30 boats that operate out of the camber docks in Camber Quay,  Old Portsmouth . They land fresh fish and shellfish daily, most of which is sold at the quayside fish market. [175] \n The city is host to the European headquarters of  IBM  and, until 2007, the UK headquarters of  Zurich Financial Services . [15] [176]  In the city centre, shopping is centred on Commercial Road and the 1980s Cascades Shopping Centre, with over 100 high street shops between them. [177] [178]  Approximately 185,000 to 230,000 people use the Cascades Shopping Centre each week. [179]  Recent redevelopment has created new shopping areas, including the upmarket  Gunwharf Quays \u2014a redevelopment of the  HMS  Vernon  naval shore establishment \u2014 [180] [181]  containing fashion stores, restaurants, and a cinema, and the Historic Dockyard, which caters to the tourist sector and holds an annual Victorian  Christmas market . [182] [183]  Ocean Retail Park sits on the north-eastern side of Portsea Island and was built on land previously occupied by a Metal Box factory in September 1985. [184] \nPortsmouth will be the home port of the two  Queen Elizabeth -class aircraft carriers , the largest ships ever built by the Royal Navy. \n Development at Gunwharf Quays continued until 2007 with the completion of the 330 feet (100\u00a0m) tall No. \u00a0 1 Gunwharf Quays residential tower (nicknamed 'Lipstick Tower'). [185] [186]  The development of the former Brickwoods Brewery site included the construction of a 22-storey tower known as the Admiralty Quarter Tower, the tallest in a complex of mostly low-rise residential buildings. [187]  A new 25-storey tower named 'Number One Portsmouth', was made public at the end of October 2008, which has been proposed at a height of 330 feet (100\u00a0m), and will stand opposite Portsmouth & Southsea Station. [188]  As of August 2009, internal demolition has started on the building that currently occupies the site. [189]  A new student accommodation tower, nicknamed 'The Blade', has started construction on the site of the old Victoria swimming baths, on the edge of Victoria Park. The tower will stand over 300 feet (91\u00a0m), and will become Portsmouth's second tallest structure after the Spinnaker Tower. [190] \n In April 2007, Portsmouth F.C. announced plans to move away from  Fratton Park  to a new stadium situated on a piece of reclaimed land beside the Historic Dockyard, nicknamed  Portsmouth Dockland Stadium . The \u00a3600 million mixed-use development, designed by architects  Herzog & de Meuron , would also include 1500 harbourside apartments as well as shops and offices. [191] [192]  The scheme attracted criticism due to its large size and location, with some officials saying that it would interfere with harbour operations. [193] [194]  The \u00a3600 million project for a new stadium was rejected by the city council due to the financial crisis of 2008. [195] \n Portsmouth will help build, and be the home port of, two new  Queen Elizabeth -class aircraft carriers :  HMS  Queen Elizabeth  and  HMS  Prince of Wales , the largest ships ever built by the Royal Navy. [196]  The supercarriers were first ordered by then Defence Secretary  Des Browne  on 25 \u00a0 July 2007. [197]  Construction of both ships took place in the Firth of Forth at  Rosyth Dockyard  and  BAE Systems Surface Ships  in Glasgow,  Babcock International  at Rosyth, and at HMNB Portsmouth. [198] [199]  It was announced by the government prior to the  Scottish Independence Referendum  that military shipbuilding would end in Portsmouth, with all UK surface warship shipbuilding to be focused instead at the two older BAE facilities in Glasgow. [200]  This was heavily criticised at the time as a political rather than economic decision to help the \"No campaign\" for Scotland to remain a part of the United Kingdom. [201] [202] \n Culture [ edit ] \n Gunwharf Quays  shopping centre \n Portsmouth has several theatres: the  New Theatre Royal  in Guildhall Walk, near the city centre, which specialises in professional drama, [203]  and the newly restored Kings Theatre in Southsea, which features amateur musicals as well a number of national tours. [204]  Another theatre is the Groundlings Theatre, which was built in 1784 and is housed in The Old Beneficial School, Portsea. [205]  New Prince's Theatre and Southsea's Kings Theatre were both designed by Victorian architect and entrepreneur  Frank Matcham . [206] \n The city also has three established music venues: the Guildhall, [207]   The Wedgewood Rooms  (which includes a smaller venue, Edge of the Wedge), [208]  and  Portsmouth Pyramids Centre . [209]   Portsmouth Guildhall , another theatrical venue, is one of the largest events venue in South East England, with a seating capacity of 2500. [83] [210] [211]  For many years a series of symphony concerts has been presented at the Guildhall by the  Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra . [212]  In the 1970s the  Portsmouth Sinfonia  approached classical music from a different angle: the Sinfonia often recruited players that had  no musical training  or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to play an instrument that was entirely new to them. [213] [214]  The Portsmouth Summer Show is held at  King George's Fields . The 2016 event was held in the last weekend of April, and featured cover bands such as the Silver Beatles, the Bog Rolling Stones, and Fleetingwood Mac. [215] \n Numerous musical works are set in the city.  Portsmouth Point  is an  overture  for orchestra by the English composer  William Walton  in 1925. The work was inspired by  Thomas Rowlandson 's etching depicting Portsmouth Point, otherwise known as \"Spice Island\" in Old Portsmouth. [216] [217]  The overture was used for the BBC Proms Concert in 2007. [218]   H.M.S. Pinafore  is a comic opera in two acts set in Portsmouth Harbour, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. \u00a0 S. Gilbert. [219]   John Cranko 's 1951 ballet  Pineapple Poll , which features the operetta music of  The Bumboat Woman's Story  by  Gilbert and Sullivan , is also set in Portsmouth. [220] [221] \n Portsmouth hosts yearly remembrances of the  D-Day landings , which veterans from Allied and Commonwealth nations attend. [222] [223]  The city played a major part in the 50th D-Day anniversary in 1994; visitors included then-US President  Bill Clinton , Australian Prime Minister  Paul Keating , King  Harald V of Norway , French president  Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand , New Zealand Prime Minister  Jim Bolger , Canadian Prime Minister  Jean Chretien , Prime Minister  John Major , the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. [224] [225]  The Portsmouth International Kite Festival is organised annually by Portsmouth City Council and The Kite Society of Great Britain. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016. [226] \n Literature [ edit ] \n In literature, Portsmouth is the chief location for  Jonathan Meades ' 1993 novel  Pompey , in which it is inhabited largely by  incestuous  and  necrophiliac  criminals. [227]  Since the release of his novel, Meades has presented a TV programme documenting Victorian architecture in Portsmouth Dockyard. [228]  In  Jane Austen 's novel  Mansfield Park , Portsmouth is the hometown of the main character Fanny Price, and is the setting of most of the closing chapters of the novel. [229]  In  Charles Dickens ' novel  The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby , main protagonists Nicholas and Smike make their way to Portsmouth and get involved in a theatrical troupe. [230]  In  Patrick O'Brian 's nautical historical  Aubrey-Maturin series , Portsmouth is most often the port from which Captain Jack Aubrey's ships sail. [231] \n Victorian novelist and historian  Sir Walter Besant  documented his childhood in the town in the 1840s in  By Celia's Arbour: A Tale of Portsmouth Town . [232]  The book is notable for its precise descriptions of the town before the defensive walls were removed. [233]  Southsea features in  The History of Mr Polly  by  H. G. Wells  under the fictional name of  Port Burdock , which he describes as \"one of the three townships that are grouped around the Port Burdock naval dockyards\". [234]   High fantasy  author  Neil Gaiman  also sets his graphic novel  The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch  around Southsea, Gaiman having grown up in Portsmouth. A street along the seafront in Southsea was renamed \"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\" by the city council in honour of his  novel of the same name . [235] [236] \n Notable crime novels set in Portsmouth and the surrounding area include  Graham Hurley 's D.I. \u00a0 Faraday/D.C. \u00a0 Winter novels [237]  and  C. J. Sansom 's Tudor crime novel  Heartstone , with the latter including references to the famous warship  Mary Rose  and descriptions of Tudor life in the town. [238]  A collection of fantastical short stories,  Portsmouth Fairy Tales for Grown Ups , was published in 2014. [239] [240]  It uses locations around Portsmouth for the stories, and includes writing by crime novelists William Sutton, Diana Bretherick, and others. [241] [242] \n Education [ edit ] \n See also:  List of schools in Portsmouth \nPark Building, University of Portsmouth \n The city's  post-1992 university , the  University of Portsmouth , has 20,000 students on campus as of 2016 [update] . [243]  The university was ranked among the top 100 modern universities in the world in April 2015. [244] [245]  As of 2013 [update] , the university had approximately 23,000 students and more than 2500 staff. [246]  Several local colleges also have the power to award  Higher National Diplomas , including  Highbury College , which specialises in vocational education, [247]  and Portsmouth College, which offers various academic courses in the city. [248]  Both  Admiral Lord Nelson School  and  Miltoncross Academy  were built in the late 1990s to meet the demand of a growing school-age population. [249] [250] \n Following the cancellation of the national building programme for schools, these redevelopments did not go ahead. [251]  In 2009, only two schools in the city were judged \"inadequate\", whereas 29 of the city's 63 schools were considered \"no longer good enough\" by  Ofsted . [252]  Before being taken over by  Ark Schools  and becoming a  Charter Academy , St \u00a0 Luke's Church of England secondary school was, in terms of GCSE achievement, one of the worst schools in the country. It was also criticised by officials for its behavioural standards\u00a0\u2013 reports were made of students repeatedly throwing chairs at teachers. [253]  Since becoming an academy in 2009, the schools have significantly improved; 69% of students achieved five GCSEs at grades A*\u00a0\u2013\u00a0C including English and mathematics. [254]  Charter Academy operates its intake policy as a standard comprehensive taking from its catchment area rather than selecting on religious background. [255] \n There is also a cohort of independent schools within the city\u00a0\u2013 the oldest, founded in 1732 by the Mayor of Portsmouth, [256] [257]  is the  Portsmouth Grammar School , which has been rated as one of the best private schools in the country. [258] [257]  The  Portsmouth High School , a member of the Girls Day School Trust, was ranked one of the top private schools for girls in the UK by A-level results in 2013. [259]  Other independent schools in the city include  Mayville High School , founded in 1897, [260]  and  St John's College , an independent Catholic boarding school. [261] [262] \n Landmarks [ edit ] \n HMS  Warrior  (right) and the  Spinnaker Tower  (left) are among the city's main attractions. \n Many of the city's former defences are now museums, or venues for hosting events. Several of the Victorian era forts on Portsdown Hill are now tourist attractions: [263]   Fort Nelson , which lies on the summit of Portsdown Hill, is home to the Royal Armouries museum. [264]  The Tudor era  Southsea Castle  has a small museum, and much of the seafront defences leading up to the  Round Tower  are open to the public. The castle was withdrawn from active service in 1960 and was subsequently purchased by Portsmouth City Council. [265]  The southern part of the Royal Marines'  Eastney Barracks  is now the  Royal Marines Museum , and was opened to the public under the  National Heritage Act 1983 . [266]  The museum was awarded a \u00a314 million grant from the National Lottery Fund, and is set to relocate to the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 2019. [267]  The birthplace of  Charles Dickens  at Mile End Terrace, [268] [269]  is now the  Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum . The two-storey red brick building became a Grade \u00a0 I listed building in 1953. [270]  Other tourist attractions include the Blue Reef Aquarium, which houses an \"underwater safari\" of aquatic life in Britain, [271]  and Cumberland House Natural History Museum, which features a variety of wildlife featured in the area. [272] [273] \n HMS  Victory  at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard is the world's oldest naval ship still in commission and is one of the city's most popular tourist attractions. \n Most of the city's landmarks and tourist attractions are related to its naval history. Among the attractions are the  D-Day Museum  and the adjacent  Overlord embroidery  in Southsea, which was awarded a grant of \u00a34 million by the  Heritage Lottery Fund  to expand it in time for 2019. [274]  The museum's embroidery is 83 metres (272\u00a0ft) long, making it the longest of its kind in the world. [275]  The city is home to some famous ships: in the dry dock of  Portsmouth Historic Dockyard  lies Horatio Nelson's flagship,  HMS  Victory , the world's oldest naval ship still in commission. HMS  Victory  was preserved for the nation and placed in permanent dry dock in 1922, when the  Society for Nautical Research  led a national appeal to restore her. [68]  22 \u00a0 million people have visited her since. [276]  In 1971, the remains of Henry VIII's flagship, the  Mary Rose , was rediscovered on the seabed. [41]  She was raised and brought into a purpose-built structure in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 1982. [277]  Britain's first iron-hulled warship,  HMS  Warrior , was restored and moved to Portsmouth in June 1987 after serving as an oil fuel pier at  Pembroke Dock  in  Pembrokeshire  for fifty years. [278] [279] [280]  The  National Museum of the Royal Navy  is also in the historic dockyard, and is sponsored by an independent charity which aims to promote research into the history and archaeology of the Royal Dockyard. [281]  Every November the Historic Dockyard hosts the Victorian Festival of Christmas, which features a traditional green-coloured  Father Christmas . [282] [283] \n Portsmouth's long association with the armed forces means it has a large number of war memorials around the city, including several at the Royal Marines Museum, [284]  and a large collection of memorials related to the Royal Navy in  Victoria Park . [131]  The  Portsmouth Naval Memorial  in Southsea Common commemorates 24,591 fallen soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War. [285]  The memorial was designed by Sir  Robert Lorimer  and was unveiled by  George VI  on 15 \u00a0 October 1924. [286]  In the city centre, the Guildhall Square Cenotaph displays the names of the fallen, and is guarded by stone sculptures of machine gunners carved by the sculptor Charles Jagger. [287]  On the west face, the description reads: \n This memorial was erected by the people of Portsmouth in proud and loving memory of those who in the glorious morning of their days for England's sake lost all but England's praise. May light perpetual shine upon them. [288] \n Portsmouth contains three cemeteries: Kingston, Milton Road, and Highland Road. Kingston Cemetery was opened in 1856 and lies on the eastern side of Fratton. At 52 acres (21\u00a0ha), it is the largest cemetery in the city and has about 400 burials a year. [289]  In February 2014, a ceremony was held at the cemetery to celebrate the 180th anniversary of Portsmouth's Polish community. [290]  Milton Road Cemetery, of some 25 acres (10\u00a0ha), was established on 8 \u00a0 April 1912 and has approximately 200 burials per year. There is also a crematorium at Portchester. [289] \n Gunwharf Quays [ edit ] \n Main article:  Gunwharf Quays \nA view of the  Spinnaker Tower  from the waterfront at  Gunwharf Quays . \n The naval shore establishment, HMS  Vernon , contained the Royal Navy's arsenal\u00a0\u2013 weapons and ammunition would be taken from ships as they entered the harbour and would be resupplied as they headed out to sea. The 1919  Southsea and Portsmouth Official Guide  described the establishment as \"the finest collections of weapons outside the Tower of London, containing more than 25,000 rifles\". [291]  In the early nineteenth century, Gunwharf Quays supplied the fleet with a \"grand arsenal\" consisting of cannons, mortars, bombs, and various ordinance. Gunpowder was not provided due to safety concerns; however, it could be obtained at Pridday's Hard near Gosport. [292]  An armoury existed to sell small arms to soldiers, along with blacksmith and carpenter shops for armourers. The establishment was run by three officers; a  viz  (storekeeper), a clerk, and a foreman. By 1817, Gunwharf purportedly housed the largest naval arsenal in the world, employing 5000 men at the time. [293] \n HMS Vernon  closed on 1 April 1996 [294]  and was redeveloped by Portsmouth City Council as Gunwharf Quays, [180]  a mixed residential and retail destination with outlet stores, restaurants, pubs, and caf\u00e9s. [295]  Construction of the  Spinnaker Tower  began in 2001 and was completed in summer 2005. The project ran overbudget and cost \u00a336 \u00a0 million, of which Portsmouth City Council contributed \u00a311 million. [296] [297] [298]  The 560 feet (170\u00a0m) tower is visible from 23 miles (37\u00a0km) on a clear day, and its viewing platforms provide views across the Solent towards the Isle of Wight, and north towards the harbour and Southsea Castle. [299] [300]  The tower has the largest glass floor in Europe and weighs more than 33,000 tonnes (32,000 long tons; 36,000 short tons). [301] [300] \n Southsea [ edit ] \n Main article:  Southsea \nA view of Southsea Promenade, which includes the  Clarence Pier  amusement park \n Southsea is a  seaside resort  and residential area that lies at the southern end of Portsea Island. The name Southsea originates from Southsea Castle, a castle on the seafront established in 1544 by Henry \u00a0 VIII to help defend the  Solent  and approaches to Portsmouth Harbour. [302]  The area was originally developed in 1809 as \"Croxton Town\", though by the 1860s the suburb of Southsea had expanded to provide houses for working-class people. [117]  During this time, Southsea grew as a seaside and bathing resort. [117]  A pump room and baths were erected near the present day  Clarence Pier , and a large complex was developed including vapour baths, showers, and card playing and assembly rooms for holiday-goers. [303] \n Clarence Pier was officially opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, and was named after the once military governor of Portsmouth,  Lord Frederick FitzClarence . At the time of its opening, the pier was labelled as \"one of the largest amusement parks on the south coast\". [304]   South Parade Pier  was built in 1878 and is among the 55 remaining private piers in the United Kingdom. [305] [306]  The pier was originally used as a terminal for ferries travelling to the Isle of Wight, but it was soon redeveloped as a centre of entertainment. It had to be rebuilt after the first fire in 1904, and rebuilt again after the second fire in 1967. The third fire struck during filming of  The Who 's concert in 1974, after which it was rebuilt once again. [305] [117]  In 2015, plans were unveiled to build the \"Solent Eye\" at the pier, an amusement ride with 24 gondolas resembling the  London Eye , at a cost of \u00a3750,000. [307] \n Southsea is dominated by Southsea Common, a grassland covering an area of 480 acres (190\u00a0ha), which was first created by draining the marshland alongside the construction of the vapour baths in 1820. The common owes its existence to the demands of the military in the early 19th century for a clear range of fire. [308]  The present day common lies parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. [308]  Today, the common is a popular recreation ground, and also a venue for a number of annual events, which includes carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals. [309] [310]  The common also has a large collection of mature  elm  trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire, which have escaped  Dutch elm disease  owing to their isolation. Other plants include the  Canary Island  date palms  Phoenix canariensis , which are some of the largest in Britain and have produced viable seed in recent years. [311] \n Religion [ edit ] \n St John the Evangelist  is a  Roman Catholic  cathedral of worship, built in 1882. It is one of the two cathedrals of the city. \n Portsmouth has two cathedrals: the  Anglican Cathedral of St Thomas  in  Old Portsmouth , and the Roman Catholic  Cathedral of St John the Evangelist  (the city is one of 34 British settlements with a  Roman Catholic  cathedral). [151] [312]  The city's first chapel, dedicated to  Thomas Becket , was built by Jean de \u00a0 Gisors in the second half of the 12th century. [313] [314]  The chapel was rebuilt and developed into the  parish church  and then  Anglican cathedral . [314] [315]  It was damaged during the  Siege of Portsmouth  in 1642, but after the restoration of the monarchy the tower and  nave  were rebuilt. [316]  Significant changes were made when the Diocese of Portsmouth was established in 1927. [317]  It became a cathedral in 1932, and was enlarged, although construction was halted during the Second World War. The cathedral was re-consecrated in the presence of  Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother  in 1991. [318] \n The  Royal Garrison Church  was founded in 1212 by  Peter des Roches ,  Bishop of Winchester . After centuries of decay, it became an ammunition store in 1540. The marriage of Charles \u00a0 II to Catherine of Braganza took place in the church in 1662. After the defeat of  Napoleon  at the  Battle of Leipzig  in 1814, large receptions were held inside the church. In 1941, a firebomb fell on the roof, destroying the nave. [49]  The church's chancel was saved by servicemen shortly after the raid; however, replacing the roof was determined to be impossible due to the large amounts of salt solution the stonework had absorbed over the years. [319] \n The Cathedral of St John the Evangelist was built in 1882 to accommodate Portsmouth's increasing Roman Catholic population, replacing a chapel built in 1796 to the west. Before 1791 Roman Catholic chapels in towns with  borough status  were prohibited. The chapel was opened after the  Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791  was passed and then replaced by the cathedral. [320]  Its construction was completed in phases: in 1882 the nave was complete; in 1886 the crossing was finished, and the  chancel  was ready by 1893, eleven years after its opening. During the blitz, the cathedral was badly damaged when Luftwaffe bombing destroyed Bishop's House next door. It was restored in 1970, 1982, and 2001. [320]  The  Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth  was founded in 1882 by  Pope Leo XIII . [d] \n Smaller places of worship in the city include St \u00a0 Jude's Church in Southsea, [322]   St \u00a0 Mary's Church  in Portsea, [323]   St \u00a0 Ann's Chapel  in the naval base [324]  and the  Portsmouth and Southsea Synagogue , which is among the oldest  synagogues  in Britain. [325] \n Sport [ edit ] \n Fratton Park , home to  Portsmouth F.C. \n Portsmouth F.C.  play their home games at  Fratton Park . They have won two  Football League  titles (1949 and 1950) [326] [327]  and won the  FA Cup  in  1939  and  2008 . [328] [329]  They returned to the  Premier League  in 2003. [330]  In 2010 they were relegated to the  Championship , and amid serious financial difficulties in February 2012, [331]  they were further relegated to  League One . [332]  In 2013 Portsmouth were relegated again, this time placing them in the  League Two , the fourth tier of English Football. [332]  In April 2013, Portsmouth \u00a0 F.C. was purchased by the Pompey Supporters Trust, becoming the largest fan-owned football club in English Football history. [333] [334] \n Moneyfields F.C.  have been playing in the  Wessex Football League  Premier Division since 1998. [335]   United Services Portsmouth F.C.  (formerly known as Portsmouth Royal Navy) and  Baffins Milton Rovers F.C.  both compete in Wessex League Division One, with United Services being formed in 1962, [336]  and Baffins Milton Rovers being founded in 2011. [337]  The  rugby  teams,  United Services Portsmouth RFC  and  Royal Navy Rugby Union , both play their home matches at the United Services Recreation Ground in the city. Royal Navy Rugby Union play in the annual  Army Navy Match  at  Twickenham . [338] \n Portsmouth hosted  first-class cricket  at the  United Services Recreation Ground  from 1882, [339]  while from 1895 to 2000  Hampshire County Cricket Club  matches were played there. This arrangement came to an end in 2000 when Hampshire moved all their home matches to their newly built  Rose Bowl  cricket ground in  West End . [340]  The city is also home to four  hockey  clubs: City of Portsmouth Hockey Club, who are based at the University's Langstone Campus; [341]  Portsmouth & Southsea Hockey Club, and Portsmouth Sharks Hockey Club, who are both based at the  Admiral Lord Nelson School ; [342]  and United Services Portsmouth Hockey Club, who are based on Burnaby Road. [343]  Great Salterns Golf Club, established in 1926, [344]  is an 18-hole parkland course with two holes playing across Saltern lake. [345]  There are also coastal courses at  Hayling , near the entrance to Langstone Harbour in the east and at the  Gosport and Stokes Bay Golf Club  to the west of Portsmouth Harbour entrance in Gosport. [107] \n Transport and communications [ edit ] \n See also:  Buses in Portsmouth \nFerries, cargo and military vessels operating from Portsmouth Harbour \n Portsmouth Harbour has passenger ferry links to  Gosport  and the  Isle of Wight  from the  Portsmouth International Port , [346]  with a car ferry service to the Isle of Wight operated by  Wightlink  located nearby. [347]  Britain's longest-standing commercial  hovercraft  service, begun in the 1960s, still runs from near Clarence Pier to  Ryde , Isle of Wight, operated by  Hovertravel . [348]  Portsmouth Continental Ferry Port has links to  Caen ,  Cherbourg-Octeville ,  St Malo , and  Le Havre  in France, [349] [350]   Santander  and  Bilbao  in Spain, [351]  and the  Channel Islands . [352]  Ferry services from the port are operated by  Brittany Ferries ,  Condor Ferries , and  LD Lines . [351] [353] [354] \n Local bus services are provided by  Stagecoach  and  First Hampshire & Dorset , serving the city of Portsmouth and its surrounding towns. Hovertravel and Stagecoach run a bus service called the Hoverbus from the city centre to Southsea Hovercraft Terminal and  The Hard Interchange , near the seafront. [355]  In addition, Countryliner runs a Saturday service to  Midhurst  in West Sussex, [356]  and  Xelabus  operate a Sunday open-top seafront summer service around the city as of 2012 [update] . [357]   National Express  services from Portsmouth run mainly from The Hard Interchange to  London Victoria station , Cornwall,  Bradford ,  Birkenhead  and  Bristol . [358] \n The city has several mainline railway stations, including  Portsmouth & Southsea railway station , [359]  and  Portsmouth Harbour railway station . [360]  Portsmouth lies on two different direct  South Western Railway  routes to  London Waterloo , via  Guildford  and  Basingstoke . [361]  There is also a South Western Railway stopping service to Southampton Central and a service by  Great Western Railway  to  Cardiff Central  via Southampton,  Salisbury , Bath, and Bristol. [362]   Southern  additionally offers service to  Brighton , Gatwick Airport,  Croydon , and  London Victoria . [363] \n On 18 May 2006,  Trasmediterranea  started a service to Bilbao in competition with  P&O 's then-existing service. This service was criticised when the ferry  Fortuny  was detained in Portsmouth by the  Maritime and Coastguard Agency  for numerous safety breaches. [364]  The faults were quickly corrected by Trasmediterr\u00e1nea, and the service was cleared to begin carrying passengers on 23 \u00a0 May 2006. [365]  In March 2007, Trasmediterr\u00e1nea withdrew the Bilbao service at short notice, citing the need to deploy the  Fortuny  elsewhere. [366]  P&O Ferries ceased their service to  Bilbao  on 27 \u00a0 September 2010, due to \"unsustainable losses\". [367] [368]  The port is the second-busiest ferry port in the UK after  Dover , handling around three million passengers a year. [369] [370] \n Portsmouth Airport , an airport with a grass runway, was in operation from 1932 to 1973. After its closure, housing (Anchorage Park), industrial sites, retail stores (Ocean Retail Park), and a school (Admiral Lord Nelson School) were built on the site. [371] [372]  Today, the nearest airport is  Southampton Airport , situated in the  Borough of Eastleigh , which lies 19.8 miles (31.9\u00a0km) away. [107]  The airport has an indirect  South Western Railway  rail connection requiring a change at  Southampton Central  or  Eastleigh . [373]   Heathrow  and  Gatwick  are 65 miles (105\u00a0km) and 75 miles (121\u00a0km) away, respectively. Gatwick is directly linked by Southern train services to London Victoria station, while Heathrow is linked by coach to  Woking , which is on both rail lines to  London Waterloo , or by  London Underground . [374]  Heathrow is directly linked to Portsmouth by National Express coaches. [375] \n There is an ongoing debate on the development of a new public transport structure, with  monorails  and  light rail  both being considered. A light rail link to Gosport was authorised in 2002 with completion expected in 2005, but it is unlikely that the project will be completed following the refusal of funding by the  Department for Transport  in November 2005. [376]  In April 2011, an article appeared in  Portsmouth News  suggesting a new scheme could be in the offing by running a light rapid transit system over the line to Southampton via Fareham,  Bursledon , and  Sholing , thus replacing the existing heavy rail services. [377] [378] \n Media [ edit ] \n Portsmouth, along with Southampton and its adjacent towns, are served predominantly with transmissions from the  Rowridge Transmitter  on the  Isle of Wight . [379]  Portsmouth was one of the first cities in the United Kingdom to have a local TV station, MyTV, although the Isle of Wight had a local television service in 1998. [380]  In November 2014, a new TV station, named  That's Solent , was launched as part of a UK-wide roll-out of local Freeview channels in southern central England. [381]  The stations are broadcast from the Rowridge Transmitter on the  Isle Of Wight . [382] \n The local commercial radio station is  The Breeze  on 107.4FM, [383]  while the city also has a non-profit community radio station  Express FM  on 93.7FM. [384]  Patients at Portsmouth's primary hospital,  Queen Alexandra  in Milton, also have access to local programming from charity station Portsmouth Hospital Broadcasting, which starting broadcasting in 1951. [385]  When the first local commercial radio stations were licensed in the 1970s by the  Independent Broadcasting Authority  (IBA),  Radio Victory  was the radio service for Portsmouth. In 1986, due to transmission area changes by the IBA, it was replaced by a new company and service called Ocean Sound, later renamed as  Heart Hampshire . From the city's 800th birthday in 1994, Victory \u00a0 FM broadcast for three 28-day periods over an 18-month period. [386]  It was purchased from the founders by TLRC, who, due to poor  RAJAR  figures, relaunched the service in 2001 as Ocean FM, [387]  with Portsmouth Football Club purchasing a stake in the station during 2007 and selling it in 2009. [388] \n The city currently has one daily local newspaper known as  The News . The paper was established in 1873 and was previously known as the  Portsmouth Evening News . A free weekly newspaper is published by the same publisher,  Johnston Press , called  The Journal . [389] [390] \n Notable residents [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of people from Portsmouth \nThe Naval War Memorial in Southsea \n The city has been home to a number of famed authors. Most notably  Charles Dickens \u00a0\u2013 known for such works as  Oliver Twist ,  A Tale of Two Cities , and  The Pickwick Papers \u00a0\u2013 was born in Portsmouth. [391]   Arthur Conan Doyle , author of the  Sherlock Holmes  stories, practised as a doctor in the city and played in goal for Portsmouth Association Football Club, an amateur team not to be confused with the later professional Portsmouth Football Club. [392] [393]   Rudyard Kipling , poet and author of the  Jungle Book , [394]  and  H. G. Wells , author of  War of the Worlds  and  The Time Machine , lived in Portsmouth during the 1880s. [395]   Sir Walter Besant , a novelist and historian, was born in Portsmouth, [396]  writing one novel set exclusively in the town,  By Celia's Arbour, A Tale of Portsmouth Town . [397]  Sir  Francis Austen , brother of  Jane Austen , briefly lived in the area after graduating from Portsmouth Naval Academy.
