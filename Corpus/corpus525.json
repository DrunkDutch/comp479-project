[5] [6]  It is the official  national language  and  lingua franca  of  Pakistan . In India, it is one of the 22  official languages  recognized in the  Constitution of India , having official status in the  five states  of  Jammu and Kashmir ,  Telangana ,  Uttar Pradesh ,  Bihar , and  Jharkhand , as well as  Delhi . \n Apart from specialized  vocabulary , Urdu is  mutually intelligible  with  Standard Hindi , another recognized register of Hindustani. The Urdu variant of Hindustani received recognition and patronage under  British rule  when the  British  replaced the local official languages with English and Hindustani written in  Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script , as the official language in  North  and  Northwestern India . [7] [8] [9]  Religious, social, and political factors pushed for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi in India, leading to the  Hindi\u2013Urdu controversy .

[11]  It evolved from the medieval (6th to 13th century)  Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba  register of the preceding  Shauraseni language , a  Middle Indo-Aryan language  that is also the ancestor of other modern Indo-Aryan languages, including the  Punjabi dialects . Urdu developed under the influence of the  Persian  and  Arabic  languages, both of which have contributed a significant amount of vocabulary to formal speech. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  Around 99% of Urdu verbs have their roots in  Sanskrit  and  Prakrit . [18] \n Although the word  Urdu  is derived from the  Turkic  word  ordu  (army) or  orda , from which English  horde  is also derived, [19]  Turkic borrowings in Urdu are minimal [20]  and Urdu is also not  genetically related  to the  Turkic languages . Urdu words originating from  Chagatai  and Arabic were borrowed through Persian and hence are Persianized versions of the original words. For instance, the Arabic  ta' marbuta  (\u00a0 \u0629 \u00a0) changes to  he  (\u00a0 \u0647 \u200e \u00a0) or  te  (\u00a0 \u062a \u200e \u00a0). [21]   [note 1]  Nevertheless, contrary to popular belief, Urdu did not borrow from the  Turkish language , but from  Chagatai . Urdu and Turkish borrowed from Arabic and Persian, hence the similarity in pronunciation of many Urdu and Turkish words. [22] \n Arabic  influence in the region began with the late first-millennium  Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent . The Persian language was introduced into the subcontinent a few centuries later by various Persianized Central Asian  Turkic  and  Afghan  dynasties including that of  Mahmud of Ghazni . [23] [24]  The Turko-Afghan  Delhi Sultanate  established Persian as its official language, a policy continued by the  Mughal Empire , which extended over most of northern  South Asia  from the 16th to 18th centuries and cemented  Persian  influence on the developing Hindustani. [ citation needed ] \n With the advent of the  British Raj , Persian was no longer the language of administration but  Hindustani , still written in the  Persian script , continued to be used by both  Hindus  and  Muslims . [ citation needed ]  The name  Urdu  was first used by the poet Ghulam Hamadani Mushafi around 1780. [25] [26] ( p18 )  From the 13th century until the end of the 18th century Urdu was commonly known as Hindi. [26] ( p1 )  The language was also known by various other names such as  Hindavi  and  Dehlavi . [26] ( pp21\u201322 )  The communal nature of the language lasted until it replaced  Persian  as the official language in 1837 and was made co-official, along with English. Urdu was promoted in British India by British policies to counter the previous emphasis on Persian. [27]  This triggered a Brahman backlash in northwestern India, which argued that the language should be written in the native  Devanagari  script. Thus a new literary register, called \"Hindi\", replaced traditional Hindustani as the official language of  Bihar  in 1881, establishing a sectarian divide of \"Urdu\" for Muslims and \"Hindi\" for Hindus, a divide that was formalized with the division of India and Pakistan after independence (though there are Hindu poets who continue to write in Urdu to this day, with post-independence examples including  Gopi Chand Narang  and  Gulzar ). \n There have been attempts to \"purify\" Urdu and Hindi, by purging Urdu of  Sanskrit  loanwords, and Hindi of Persian loan words, and new vocabulary draws primarily from Persian and Arabic for Urdu and from Sanskrit for Hindi. English has exerted a heavy influence on both as a co-official language. [28] \n Speakers and geographic distribution [ edit ] \n See also:  Languages of Pakistan  and  Languages of India \nThe phrase  Zab\u0101n-i Urd\u016b-yi Mu\u02bfall\u0101  (\"The language of the exalted camp\") written in  Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script . \n There are over 100 million native speakers of Urdu in India (more than 80% of it) and Pakistan together: there were 52 million and 80.5 million Urdu speakers in India some 5% and 6.5% of the total population of India as per the 2001 and 2011 censuses respectively; [29]  approximately 10 million in Pakistan or 7.57% as per the 1998 census and 16 million in 2006 estimates; [30]  and several hundred thousand in the  United Kingdom ,  Saudi Arabia ,  United States , and  Bangladesh  (where it is called \"Bihari\"). [31]  However, a knowledge of Urdu allows one to speak with far more people than that, because  Hindustani , of which Urdu is one variety, is the third most commonly spoken language in the world, after  Mandarin  and  English  . [32]  Because of the difficulty in distinguishing between Urdu and Hindi speakers in India and Pakistan, as well as estimating the number of people for whom Urdu is a second language, the estimated number of speakers is uncertain and controversial. [ citation needed ] \n Owing to interaction with other languages, Urdu has become localized wherever it is spoken, including in Pakistan. Urdu in Pakistan has undergone changes and has incorporated and borrowed many words from regional languages like  Pashto ,  Punjabi ,  Sindhi  and  Balti , thus allowing speakers of the language in Pakistan to distinguish themselves more easily and giving the language a decidedly Pakistani flavour. Similarly, the Urdu spoken in India can also be distinguished into many dialects like  Dakhni  ( Deccan ) of South India, and Khariboli of the  Punjab region . Because of Urdu's similarity to  Hindi , speakers of the two languages can easily understand one another if both sides refrain from using specialized vocabulary. The  syntax  (grammar),  morphology , and the  core vocabulary  are essentially identical. Thus linguists usually count them as one single language and contend that they are considered as two different languages for socio-political reasons. [33] \n In Pakistan, Urdu is mostly learned as a second or a third language as nearly 93% of Pakistan's population has a native language other than Urdu. Despite this, Urdu was chosen as a token of unity and as a  lingua franca  so as not to give any native Pakistani language preference over the other. Urdu is therefore spoken and understood by the vast majority in some form or another, including a majority of urban dwellers in such cities as  Karachi ,  Lahore ,  Okara District ,  Sialkot ,  Rawalpindi ,  Islamabad ,  Multan ,  Faisalabad ,  Hyderabad ,  Peshawar ,  Quetta ,  Jhang ,  Sargodha  and  Skardu . It is written, spoken and used in all  provinces/territories of Pakistan  although the people from differing provinces may have different indigenous languages, as from the fact that it is the \"base language\" of the country. For this reason, it is also taught as a compulsory subject up to higher secondary school in both English and Urdu medium school systems. This has produced millions of Urdu speakers from people whose native language is one of the  State languages of Pakistan  such as  Standard Punjabi ,  Pashto ,  Sindhi ,  Balochi ,  Potwari ,  Hindko ,  Pahari ,  Saraiki ,  Balti , and  Brahui  who can read and write only Urdu. It is absorbing many words from the regional languages of Pakistan. This variation of Urdu is sometimes referred to as Pakistani Urdu. [ citation needed ] \n Although most of the population is conversant in Urdu, it is the first language of only an estimated 7% of the population who are mainly Muslim immigrants (known as  Muhajir  in Pakistan) from different parts of  South Asia . The regional languages are also being influenced by Urdu vocabulary. There are millions of Pakistanis whose native language is not Urdu, but because they have studied in Urdu medium schools, they can read and write Urdu along with their native language. Most of the nearly five million  Afghan refugees  of different ethnic origins (such as  Pashtun ,  Tajik ,  Uzbek ,  Hazarvi , and  Turkmen ) who stayed in Pakistan for over twenty-five years have also become fluent in Urdu. With such a large number of people(s) speaking Urdu, the language has acquired a peculiar Pakistani flavour further distinguishing it from the Urdu spoken by native speakers and diversifying the language even further. \n Many newspapers are published in Urdu in Pakistan, including the  Daily Jang ,  Nawa-i-Waqt ,  Millat , among many others (see  List of newspapers in Pakistan#Urdu language Newspapers ). \n In India, Urdu is spoken in places where there are large Muslim minorities or cities that were bases for Muslim Empires in the past. These include parts of  Uttar Pradesh ,  Madhya Pradesh ,  Bihar ,  Telangana ,  Andhra Pradesh ,  Maharashtra  ( Marathwada ),  Karnataka  and cities such as  Lucknow ,  Delhi ,  Bareilly ,  Meerut ,  Saharanpur ,  Muzaffarnagar ,  Roorkee ,  Deoband ,  Moradabad ,  Azamgarh ,  Bijnor ,  Najibabad ,  Rampur ,  Aligarh ,  Allahabad ,  Gorakhpur ,  Agra ,  Kanpur ,  Badaun ,  Bhopal ,  Hyderabad ,  Aurangabad ,  Bangalore ,  Kolkata ,  Mysore ,  Patna ,  Gulbarga ,  Parbhani ,  Nanded ,  Malegaon ,  Bidar ,  Ajmer , and  Ahmedabad . [34]  Some Indian schools teach Urdu as a first language and have their own syllabi and exams. Indian  madrasahs  also teach  Arabic  as well as Urdu. India has more than 3,000 Urdu publications, including 405 daily Urdu newspapers. Newspapers such as  Neshat News Urdu ,  Sahara Urdu ,  Daily Salar ,  Hindustan Express ,  Daily Pasban ,  Siasat Daily ,  The Munsif Daily  and  Inqilab  are published and distributed in  Bangalore ,  Malegaon ,  Mysore ,  Hyderabad , and  Mumbai  (see  List of newspapers in India ). \n Outside  South Asia , it is spoken by large numbers of migrant South Asian workers in the major urban centres of the  Persian Gulf  countries. Urdu is also spoken by large numbers of immigrants and their children in the major urban centres of the  United Kingdom , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Germany ,  Norway , and  Australia . Along with  Arabic , Urdu is among the immigrant languages with the most speakers in  Catalonia , leading to fears of linguistic ghettos. [35] \n Cultural identity and Islam [ edit ] \n Colonial India [ edit ] \n Religious and social atmospheres in early nineteenth century India played significant roles in the development of the Urdu register. In addition to Islam, India was characterized by a number of tribal religions which each represented different spiritual outlooks and maintained different languages. These tribal religions were later categorized by British colonialists as Hinduism. Under British rule, the dispersed tribes associated with Hinduism pushed for unification by means of a common language.  Hindi  became the distinct register spoken by those who sought to construct a Hindu identity in the face of colonial rule. [10]  As Hindi separated from Hindustani to create a distinct spiritual identity, Urdu, which was originally spoken by both Hindu and Muslim elites, was employed to create a definitive Islamic identity for the Muslim population in India. [36] \n As Urdu and Hindi became means of religious and social construction for Muslims and Hindus respectively, each register developed its own script. According to Islamic tradition,  Arabic , the language spoken by the prophet  Muhammad  and uttered in creation of the  Qur'an , holds spiritual significance and power. [37]  Because Urdu was intentioned as means of unification for Muslims in Northern India and later Pakistan, it adopted an Arabic script. [38] [10] \n Pakistan [ edit ] \n Urdu continued its role in developing a Muslim identity as the  Islamic Republic of Pakistan  was established with the intent to construct a homeland for Islamic believers. Several languages and dialects spoken throughout the regions of Pakistan produced an imminent need for a uniting language. Because Urdu was the symbol of Islamic identity in Northern India, it was selected as the national language for Pakistan. While Urdu and Islam together played important roles in developing the national identity of Pakistan, disputes in the 1950s challenged the necessity for Urdu as a national symbol and its practicality as the lingua franca. The significance of Urdu as a national symbol was downplayed by these disputes when English and Bengali were also accepted as official languages. In addition to the disagreements over the value of Urdu as a national language in Pakistan, recent Muslims in Asia question the necessity for the Urdu script to be distinctly different from the Hindi script. While early nineteenth century Muslims saw the Arabic script as part of their identity, certain modern Muslims choose to use a modified Hindi script in writing Urdu. Although Urdu was a distinct identity marker for Muslims in colonialist ruled India and a national symbol for Pakistan, its necessity has been put into question by modern Muslims in both India and Pakistan. \n Official status [ edit ] \nA trilingual  signboard  in  Arabic , English and Urdu in the  UAE \nA multilingual  New Delhi  railway station board \n Urdu is the national and one of the two official languages of Pakistan, along with English, and is spoken and understood throughout the country, whereas the state-by-state languages (languages spoken throughout various regions) are the  provincial languages . Only 7.57% of Pakistanis have Urdu as their first language, [39]  but Urdu is mostly understood and spoken all over Pakistan as a second or third language. It is used in  education ,  literature , office and court business. [40]  It holds in itself a repository of the  cultural  and  social  heritage of the country. [41]  Although English is used in most elite circles, and  Punjabi  has a plurality of native speakers, Urdu is the  lingua franca  and national language of Pakistan. In practice English is used instead of Urdu in the higher echelons of government. [42] \n Urdu is also one of the officially recognized languages in  India  and the official language of  Jammu and Kashmir , one of the two official languages of  Telangana  and also has the status of  \"additional official language\"  in the  Indian states  of  Uttar Pradesh ,  Bihar ,  Jharkhand ,  West Bengal  and the national capital,  New Delhi . [43] \n In  Jammu and Kashmir , section 145 of the Kashmir Constitution provides: \"The official language of the State shall be Urdu but the English language shall unless the Legislature by law otherwise provides, continue to be used for all the official purposes of the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of the Constitution.\" [44] \n Dialects [ edit ] \n Urdu has a few recognised dialects, including  Dakhni ,  Rekhta , and Modern Vernacular Urdu (based on the  Khariboli  dialect of the Delhi region).  Dakhni  (also known as Dakani, Deccani, Desia, Mirgan) is spoken in  Deccan  region of southern India. It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from  Marathi  and  Konkani , as well as some vocabulary from  Arabic ,  Persian  and  Chagatai  that are not found in the standard dialect of Urdu. Dakhini is widely spoken in all parts of  Maharashtra ,  Telangana ,  Andhra Pradesh  and  Karnataka . Urdu is read and written as in other parts of India. A number of daily newspapers and several monthly magazines in Urdu are published in these states. In terms of pronunciation, the easiest way to recognize native speakers is by their pronunciation of the letter  \"q\u0101f\"  ( \u0642 \u200e ) as  \"k\u0332h\u0332e\"  ( \u062e \u200e ). \n Code switching [ edit ] \n Many bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display  code-switching  (referred to as \"Urdish\") in certain localities and between certain social groups. \n On 14 August 2015, the  Government of Pakistan  launched the  Ilm  Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish.  Ahsan Iqbal , Federal Minister of Pakistan, said, \"Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English and will name it Urdish.\" [45] [46] [47] \n Comparison with Modern Standard Hindi [ edit ] \nUrdu and Hindi on a road sign in India \n Further information:  Hindi\u2013Urdu controversy ,  Hindustani phonology , and  Hindustani grammar \n Standard Urdu is often  contrasted  with  Standard Hindi . [48]  Apart from religious associations, the differences are largely restricted to the  standard forms : Standard Urdu is conventionally written in the  Nastaliq style  of the  Persian alphabet  and relies heavily on Persian and Arabic as a source for technical and literary vocabulary, [49]  whereas Standard Hindi is conventionally written in  Devan\u0101gar\u012b  and draws on  Sanskrit . [50]  However, both have large numbers of Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit words, and most linguists consider them to be two standardised forms of the same language, [51] [52]  and consider the differences to be  sociolinguistic , [53]  though a few classify them separately. [54]  Old Urdu dictionaries also contain most of the Sanskrit words now present in Hindi. [55] [56]  Mutual intelligibility decreases in literary and specialized contexts that rely on educated vocabulary. Further, it is quite easy in a longer conversation to distinguish differences in vocabulary and pronunciation of some Urdu  phonemes . As a result of religious nationalism since the  partition of British India  and continued communal tensions, native speakers of both Hindi and Urdu frequently assert them to be distinct languages, despite the numerous similarities between the two in a colloquial setting. \n The barrier created between Hindi and Urdu is eroding: Hindi speakers are comfortable with using Persian-Arabic borrowed words [57]  and Urdu speakers are also comfortable with using Sanskrit terminology.

The more formal register of Urdu is sometimes referred to as  zab\u0101n-i Urd\u016b-yi mu\u02bfall\u00e1  ( \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0626\u06d2 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0651\u0670\u0649 \u200e  [z\u0259ba\u02d0n e\u02d0 \u028ard\u032au e\u02d0 mo\u0259lla\u02d0] ), the \"Language of the Exalted Camp\", referring to the Imperial army. [66] \n The  etymology  of the word used in the Urdu language for the most part decides how polite or refined one's speech is. For example, Urdu speakers would distinguish between  \u067e\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u200e  p\u0101n\u012b  and  \u0622\u0628 \u200e  \u0101b , both meaning \"water\"; the former is used colloquially and has older  Indic  origins, whereas the latter is used formally and poetically, being of  Persian  origin. \n If a word is of  Persian  or  Arabic  origin, the level of speech is considered to be more formal and grand. Similarly, if Persian or Arabic grammar constructs, such as the  izafat , are used in Urdu, the level of speech is also considered more formal and grand. If a word is inherited from  Sanskrit , the level of speech is considered more colloquial and personal. [67]  This distinction is similar to the division in English between words of  Latin ,  French  and  Old English  origins. [ citation needed ] \n Writing system  [ edit ] \n Main articles:  Urdu alphabet  and  Urdu braille \n Further information:  Hindustani orthography \nThe Urdu  Nasta\u02bfliq  alphabet, with names in the Devan\u0101gar\u012b and Latin alphabets \n Urdu is written right-to left in an extension of the  Persian alphabet , which is itself an extension of the  Arabic alphabet . Urdu is associated with the  Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq style  of  Persian calligraphy , whereas  Arabic  is generally written in the  Naskh  or  Ruq'ah  styles.  Nasta\u2019liq  is notoriously difficult to typeset, so Urdu newspapers were hand-written by masters of calligraphy, known as  k\u0101tib  or  kh ush-naw\u012bs , until the late 1980s. [ citation needed ]  One handwritten Urdu newspaper,  The Musalman , is still published daily in  Chennai . [68] \n Urdu has also historically been written in the  Kaithi  script. A highly Persianized and technical form of Urdu was the  lingua franca  of the law courts of the British administration in  Bengal ,  Bihar , and the North-West Provinces & Oudh. Until the late 19th century, all proceedings and court transactions in this register of Urdu were written officially in the Persian script. In 1880,  Sir Ashley Eden , the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal abolished the use of the Persian alphabet in the law courts of  Bengal  and  Bihar  and ordered the exclusive use of  Kaithi , a popular script used for both Urdu and  Hindi . [69]  Kaithi's association with Urdu and  Hindi  was ultimately eliminated by the political contest between these languages and their scripts, in which the Persian script was definitively linked to Urdu. \n More recently in India, Urdu speakers have adopted  Devanagari  for publishing Urdu periodicals and have innovated new strategies to mark Urdu in Devanagari as distinct from Hindi in Devanagari. Such publishers have introduced new orthographic features into Devanagari for the purpose of representing the Perso-Arabic etymology of Urdu words. One example is the use of \u0905 (Devanagari  a ) with vowel signs to mimic contexts of  \u0639 \u200e ( \u2018ain ), in violation of Hindi orthographic rules. For Urdu publishers, the use of Devanagari gives them a greater audience, whereas the orthographic changes help them preserve a distinct identity of Urdu. [70] \n Literature [ edit ] \n Main article:  Urdu literature \n Urdu has become a literary language only in recent centuries, as  Persian  was formerly the idiom of choice for the Muslim courts of North India. However, despite its relatively late development, Urdu literature boasts of some world-recognised artists and a considerable corpus. \n Prose [ edit ] \n Urdu afsana is a kind of Urdu prose in which many experiments have been done by short story writers from Munshi Prem Chand to  Naeem Baig . \n Religious [ edit ] \n Urdu holds the largest collection of works on  Islamic literature  and  Sharia . [ citation needed ]  These include translations and interpretation of the  Qur'an  as well as commentary on  Hadith ,  Fiqh ,  history , and  Sufism . A great number of classical texts from  Arabic  and  Persian  have also been translated into Urdu. Relatively inexpensive publishing, combined with the use of Urdu as a  lingua franca  among Muslims of  South Asia , has meant that Islam-related works in Urdu far outnumber such works in any other South Asian language. Popular Islamic books are also written in Urdu. \n It is interesting to note that a treatise on Astrology was penned in Urdu by  Pandit Roop Chand Joshi  in the eighteenth century. The book, known as  Lal Kitab , is widely popular in North India among astrologers. \n Literary [ edit ] \n Secular prose includes all categories of widely known fiction and non-fiction work, separable into genres. The  d\u0101st\u0101n , or tale, a traditional story that may have many characters and complex plotting. This has now fallen into disuse. \n The  afs\u0101na  or  short story  is probably the best-known genre of Urdu fiction. The best-known  afs\u0101na  writers, or  afs\u0101na nig\u0101r , in Urdu are  Munshi Premchand ,  Saadat Hasan Manto ,  Rajinder Singh Bedi ,  Krishan Chander ,  Qurratulain Hyder  (Qurat-ul-Ain Haider),  Ismat Chughtai ,  Ghulam Abbas , and  Ahmad Nadeem Qasimi . Towards the end of last century Paigham Afaqui's novel Makaan appeared with a reviving force for Urdu novel resulting into writing of novels getting a boost in Urdu literature and a number of writers like Ghazanfer, Abdus Samad, Sarwat Khan and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have taken the move forward. Munshi Premchand, became known as a pioneer in the  afs\u0101na , though some contend that his were not technically the first as Sir Ross Masood had already written many short stories in Urdu.  Novels  form a genre of their own, in the tradition of the  English novel . Other genres include  saf\u00e9rn\u0101ma  (travel story),  mazmoon  (essay),  sarguzisht  (account/narrative),  inshaeya  (satirical essay),  murasela  (editorial), and  khud navvisht  (autobiography). \n Poetry [ edit ] \n Main article:  Urdu poetry \n Further information:  Urdu poets \n Mir Taqi Mir  (1723\u20131810) ( Urdu :  \u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u200e \u200e) was the leading Urdu poet of the 18th century in the courts of  Mughal Empire  and  Nawabs of Awadh \nAn illustrated manuscript of one of  Amir Khusrau 's (1253\u20131325 CE)  Persian  poems \n Allama Muhammad Iqbal , the national poet of  Pakistan \n Urdu has been one of the premier languages of poetry in South Asia for two centuries, and has developed a rich tradition in a variety of poetic genres. The  Ghazal  in Urdu represents the most popular form of subjective music and poetry, whereas the  Nazm  exemplifies the objective kind, often reserved for narrative, descriptive, didactic or satirical purposes. Under the broad head of the Nazm we may also include the classical forms of poems known by specific names such as  Masnavi  (a long narrative poem in rhyming couplets on any theme: romantic, religious, or didactic),  Marsia  (an elegy traditionally meant to commemorate the martyrdom of  Husayn ibn Ali , grandson of Muhammad, and his comrades of the  Karbala  fame), or  Qasida  (a panegyric written in praise of a king or a nobleman), for all these poems have a single presiding subject, logically developed and concluded. However, these poetic species have an old world aura about their subject and style, and are different from the modern Nazm, supposed to have come into vogue in the later part of the nineteenth century. Probably the most widely recited, and memorised genre of contemporary Urdu poetry is  n\u0101t \u2014panegyric poetry written in praise of  Muhammad .  N\u0101t  can be of any formal category, but is most commonly in the  ghazal  form. The language used in Urdu  n\u0101t  ranges from the intensely colloquial to a highly  persified  formal language. The great early 20th century scholar  Ala Hazrat ,  Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi , who wrote many of the most well known  n\u0101t s in Urdu (the collection of his poetic work is Hadaiq-e-Baqhshish), epitomised this range in a  ghazal  of nine stanzas ( bayt ) in which every stanza contains half a line each of Arabic, Persian, formal Urdu, and colloquial Hindi. \n Another important genre of Urdu prose are the poems commemorating the martyrdom of  Husayn ibn Ali  at the  Battle of Karbala , called  noha  (\u0646\u0648\u062d\u06c1) and  marsia .  Anees  and  Dabeer  are famous in this regard. \n Terminology [ edit ] \n As\u0331\u1e96\u02bf\u0101r  ( \u0627\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u200e , verse, couplets): It consists of two hemistiches (lines) called  Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf  ( \u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639 \u200e ); first hemistich (line) is called  \u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639\u0650 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0670\u06cc \u200e  ( Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf-i \u016bl\u00e1 ) and the second is called ( \u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639\u0650 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u200e ) ( Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf-i s\u0331\u0101n\u012b ). Each verse embodies a single thought or subject (singular)  \u0634\u0650\u0639\u0631 \u200e   sh i\u02bfr . \n In the Urdu poetic tradition, most poets use a pen name called the  ta kh allu\u1e63 . This can be either a part of a poet's given name or something else adopted as an identity. The traditional convention in identifying Urdu poets is to mention the  ta kh allu\u1e63  at the end of the name. Thus Ghalib, whose official name and title was Mirza Asadullah Beg Khan, is referred to formally as Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, or in common parlance as just Mirza Ghalib. Because the  ta kh allu\u1e63  can be a part of their actual name, some poets end up having that part of their name repeated, such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz. \n The word  ta kh allu\u1e63  is derived from Arabic, meaning \"ending\". This is because in the ghazal form, the poet would usually incorporate his or her pen name into the final couplet ( maqt\u0324a\u02bf ) of each poem as a type of \"signature\". \n Urdu poetry example [ edit ] \n This is  Ghalib 's famous couplet in which he compares himself to his great predecessor, the master poet  Mir : [71] \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u0631\u06cc\u062e\u062a\u06d2 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062a\u0645\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u06c1\u0648 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0614 \u200e \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u060e \u200e \n \u06a9\u06c1\u062a\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06af\u0644\u06d2 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0614 \u0628\u06be\u06cc \u062a\u06be\u0627 \u200e \n Transliteration [ edit ] \n Re\u1e35\u1e96tah ke tumh\u012b ust\u0101d nah\u012b\u1e49 ho G\u0331\u1e96\u0101lib \n Kahte hai\u1e49 Agle zam\u0101ne me\u1e49 ko'\u012b M\u012br bh\u012b th\u0101 \n Translation [ edit ] \n You are not the only master of  Rekhta , [note 2]  Ghalib \n (They) say that in the past there also was someone (named) Mir. \n Sample text [ edit ] \n See also:  Hindi \u00a7\u00a0Sample text \n The following is a sample text in Urdu, of the Article 1 of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  (by the  United Nations ): \n Urdu text [ edit ] \n \u062f\u0641\u0639\u06c1 \u06f1:  \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0648 \u0639\u0632\u062a \u06a9\u06d2 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0627 \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4 \u0627\u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0636\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u062a \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u06c1\u06d2\u06d4 \u0627\u0633 \u0644\u0626\u06d2 \u0627\u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u0631\u06d2 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u0628\u06be\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u06a9\u0627 \u0633\u0644\u0648\u06a9 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0686\u0627\u06c1\u0626\u06d2\u06d4 \n \u200e \n Transliteration (ALA-LC) [ edit ] \n Daf\u02bfah 1:  Tam\u0101m ins\u0101n \u0101z\u0101d aur \u1e25uq\u016bq o \u02bfizzat ke i\u02bftib\u0101r se bar\u0101bar paid\u0101 h\u016b\u02bee hai\u1e49.
