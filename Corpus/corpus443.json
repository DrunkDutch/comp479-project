There might be a discussion about this on the  talk page . Please help  improve this article  if you can.   (January 2012) \n Slow Design  is a branch of the  Slow Movement , which began with the concept of  Slow Food , a term coined in contrast to  fast food . As with every branch of the Slow Movement, the overarching goal of Slow Design is to promote well being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. Slow Design seeks a holistic approach to designing that takes into consideration a wide range of material and social factors as well as the short and long term impacts of the design. \n Contents \n 1   Origin and meaning \n 2   Current and future practice \n 3   See also \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n Origin and meaning [ edit ] \n Slow Design refers to the goals and approach of the designer, rather than the object of the design. In this way a Slow Design approach can be used within any  design  field. The term was probably first coined by Alistair Fuad-Luke in his 2002 paper \"'Slow Design' - a paradigm for living sustainably?\", in which Slow Design is seen as the next step in the development of  sustainable design , balancing individual, socio-cultural, and environmental needs. [1] \n While Fuad-Luke focused on the design of physical products, the concept can be applied to the design of non-material things such as experiences, processes, services, and organizations. In fact, Slow Design may be seen as a path toward the  dematerialization  required for long-term sustainability as it takes into account the non-material nature of human well being and  happiness . \n Beth Meredith and Eric Storm attempt to summarize the concept, stating: \n Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.

It could evolve in the following ways: \n Longer design processes with more time for research, contemplation, real life impact tests, and fine tuning. \n Design for manufacturing with local or regional materials and technologies or design that supports local industries, workshops, and craftspeople. \n Design that takes into account local or regional culture both as a source of inspiration and as an important consideration for the design outcome. \n Design that studies the concept of natural time cycles and incorporates them into design and manufacturing processes. \n Design that looks at longer cycles of human behavior and sustainability. \n Design that takes into account deeper well being and the findings of  positive psychology . \n See also [ edit ] \n Design portal \n Slow Movement \n Systems thinking \n Design thinking \n User-centered design \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Fuad-Luke, Alistair.  \"'Slow Design' - a paradigm for living sustainably?\" . arts.ulster.ac.uk. 2002.
