Or How To Take-Down The Internet Archive. \n Last Updated: December 5 2014 \r\nArticle by  Richard  Stobbe Field LLP \n Your  LinkedIn  Connections  at Firm They say the internet never forgets. From time to time, someone\r\nwants to challenge that dictum. \n In our earlier posts, we discussed the so-called \"right to\r\nbe forgotten\" in connection with\u00a0a Canadian  trade-secret misappropriation and\r\npassing-off case  and an  EU privacy\r\ncase . In a brief ruling in October, the Federal\r\nCourt reviewed a copyright claim that fits into this same category.\r\nIn\u00a0 Davydiuk v. Internet Archive\r\nCanada , 2014 FC 944 (CanLII), the plaintiff\r\nsought to remove certain pornographic films that were filmed and\r\nposted online years earlier. By 2009, the plaintiff had\r\nsuccessfully pulled down the content from the original sites on\r\nwhich the content had been hosted. However, the plaintiff\r\ndiscovered that the Internet Archive's \"Wayback\r\nMachine\" had crawled and retained copies of the content as\r\npart of its archive. \n If you're not familiar with the Wayback Machine, here is the\r\ncourt's description: \"The 'Wayback Machine' is a\r\ncollection of websites accessible through the websites\r\n'archive.org' and 'web.archive.org'. The collection\r\nis created by software programs known as crawlers, which surf the\r\ninternet and store copies of websites, preserving them as they\r\nexisted at the time they were visited. According to Internet\r\nArchive, users of the Wayback Machine can view more than 240\r\nbillion pages stored in its archive that are hosted on servers\r\nlocated in the United States. The Wayback Machine has six staff to\r\nkeep it running and is operated from San Francisco, California at\r\nInternet Archive's office. None of the computers used by\r\nInternet Archive are located in Canada.\" \n The plaintiff used copyright claims to seek the removal of this\r\ncontent from the Internet Archive servers, and these efforts\r\nincluded DMCA notices in the US. Ultimately unsatisfied with the\r\nresults, the plaintiff commenced an action in Federal Court in\r\nCanada based on copyrights. The Internet Archive disputed that\r\nCanada was the proper forum: it argued that California was more\r\nappropriate\u00a0since all of the servers in question were located\r\nin the US and Internet Archive was a California entity. \n Since Internet Archive raised a doctrine known as \"forum\r\nnon conveniens\", it had to convince the court that the\r\nalternative forum (California) was \"clearly more\r\nappropriate\" than the Canadian court. It is not good enough to\r\nsimply that there is an appropriate forum elsewhere, rather the\r\nparty making this argument has to show that  clearly  the\r\nother forum is more appropriate, fairer and more efficient. The\r\nFederal Court was not convinced, and it concluded that there was a\r\nreal and substantial connection to Canada. The case will remain in\r\nCanadian Federal Court. A few interesting points come out of this\r\ndecision: \n This is not a privacy case. It turns upon copyright claims,\r\nsince the plaintiff in this case had acquired the copyrights to the\r\noriginal content. Nevertheless, the principles in this case (to\r\ndetermine which court is the proper place to hear the case) could\r\nbe applied to any number of situations, including privacy,\r\ncopyright or personality rights. \n Interestingly, the fact that the plaintiff had used American\r\nDMCA notices did not, by itself, convince the court that the US was\r\nthe best forum for this case. \n The court looked to a recent trademark decision\r\n( Homeaway.com Inc. v. Hrdlicka ) to show that a trademark\r\nsimply appearing on the computer screen in Canada constituted use\r\nand advertising in Canada for trademark law purposes. Here,\r\naccessing the content in Canada from servers located in the US\r\nconstituted access in Canada for copyright purposes. \n While some factors favoured California, and some favoured\r\nCanada, the court concluded that California was not  clearly\r\nmore appropriate . This shows there is a first-mover advantage\r\nin commencing the action in the preferred\r\njurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The content of this article is intended to provide a general\r\nguide to the subject matter.
