Moreover, avoid gifts to any Snap Inc. employee when the circumstances create or appear to create a conflict of interest. \u00a0For example, do not offer anything of value during a bid process or contract negotiation. Gifts offered or given at such times may appear as attempts to improperly influence Snap Inc. employees. Any gifts, meals, or entertainment must comply with applicable laws, must not exceed $100 in value and must be consistent with local custom and practice. Cash and cash equivalents, such as gift cards, are never acceptable.\u00a0 \n Intellectual Property & Confidential Information \n Supplier will respect intellectual-property rights.

Supplier must source only from certified conflict-free smelters, must adhere to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, must exercise diligence on the source and chain of custody of minerals used in their products, and must provide details of their diligence measures on request. \n If Supplier produces goods containing tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold, Supplier must adopt a conflict-minerals policy that is consistent with this Supplier Code of Conduct and the OECD Guidance. Supplier must distribute its conflict-minerals policy to all of its subcontractors and suppliers that provide materials for the manufacture of goods and must obtain agreements from those subcontractors and suppliers that they will also comply with the policy. Supplier may only use tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold in goods if Supplier can reasonably demonstrate that it has exercised due diligence in accordance with the OECD Guidance regarding the source and chain of custody of such metals, and satisfied the reporting and sourcing requirements of this policy. If Supplier cannot reasonably demonstrate such compliance, then Supplier must not use tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold in any goods. Supplier must maintain reasonable documentary evidence of Supplier\u2019s reporting, sourcing, and due-diligence activities, and must make such records available to Snap Inc. on request. \n 5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0SUPPLIER QUALITY \n Snap Inc. requires that its suppliers provide quality components. We believe quality is best optimized by ensuring that Suppliers have appropriate quality assurance processes and controls. \n Supplier must therefore comply with industry standards for manufacturing goods and providing of services to Snap Inc., including a commitment to the philosophy of continuous quality improvement. Supplier will collaborate with Snap Inc. to identify quality issues, risks, and costs, and develop plans for improvement where warranted. Supplier will timely resolve any deficiencies. \n Supplier\u2019s commitment to continuous quality improvement will necessarily involve changes to manage cost, quality, delivery, and technology. However, implementation of unapproved changes can have unintended effects on our products. Supplier accordingly will notify Snap Inc. of changes made to materials, products, or \u00a0processes. \n Supplier will make supplier management a part of its quality system. Supplier will actively manage its suppliers, alert Snap Inc. if it becomes aware of any quality (or other) risks posed by a particular supplier, and collaborate with Snap Inc. to agree on how to mitigate and manage any such issues. \n 6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ASSESSMENTS \n Supplier will periodically evaluate its operations and those of its subsidiaries, affiliates, and subcontractors to ensure compliance with this Code. Supplier will let Snap Inc. or a Snap Inc. agent assess any operations that are providing goods or services for Snap Inc. or for Snap Inc.\u2019s benefit. Supplier will commit to timely correct any deficiencies identified by an assessment, inspection, or other review. \n \u00a9 2017 Snap Inc.
