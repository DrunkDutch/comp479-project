On the cloud, 17.10 brings Kubernetes 1.8 for hyper-elastic container operations, and minimal base images for containers. This is the 27th release of Ubuntu, the world\u2019s most widely used Linux, and forms the baseline for features in the upcoming Long Term Support enterprise-class release in April 2018. \n \u201cUbuntu 17.10 is a milestone in our mission to enable developers across the cloud and the Internet of Things\u201d said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO and Founder of Canonical. \u201cWith the latest capabilities in Linux, it provides a preview of the next major LTS and a new generation of operations for AI, container-based applications and edge computing.\u201d \n Enhanced security and productivity for developers \n The Atom editor and Microsoft Visual Studio Code are emerging as the new wave of popular development tools, and both are available across all supported releases of Ubuntu including 16.04 LTS and 17.10. \n The new default desktop features the latest version of GNOME with extensions developed in collaboration with the GNOME Shell team to provide a familiar experience to long-standing Ubuntu users. 17.10 will run Wayland as the default display server on compatible hardware, with the option of Xorg where required. \n Connecting to WiFi in public areas is simplified with support for captive portals. Firefox 56 and Thunderbird 52 both come as standard together with the latest LibreOffice 5.4.1 suite. Ubuntu 17.10 supports driverless printing with IPP Everywhere, Apple AirPrint, Mopria, and WiFi Direct. This release enables simple switching between built-in audio devices and Bluetooth. \n Secure app distribution with snaps \n In the 6 months since April 2017, the number of snaps has doubled with over 2000 now available for Ubuntu, Debian, Solus and other Linux distributions. Snaps are a single delivery and update mechanism for an application across multiple Linux releases, and improve security by confining the app to its own set of data.  Hiri ,  Wavebox , and the  Heroku  CLI are notable snaps published during this cycle . \n Ubuntu 17.10 features platform snaps for GNOME and KDE which enable developers to build and distribute smaller snaps with shared common libraries. Delta updates already ensure that snap updates are generally faster, use less bandwidth, and are more reliable than updates to traditional deb packages in Ubuntu. \n The catkin Snapcraft plugin enables Robot Operating System (ROS) snaps for secure, easily updated robots and drones. There are many new mediated secure interfaces available to snap developers, including the ability to use Amazon Greengrass and Password Manager. \n The latest hardware support and container capabilities \n Ubuntu 17.10 ships with the 4.13 based Linux kernel, enabling the latest hardware and peripherals from ARM, IBM, Dell, Intel, and others. The 17.10 kernel adds support for OPAL disk drives and numerous improvements to disk I/O. Namespaced file capabilities and Linux Security Module stacking reinforce Ubuntu\u2019s leadership in container capabilities for cloud and bare-metal Kubernetes, Docker and LXD operations. \n Canonical\u2019s  Distribution of Kubernetes , CDK, supports the latest 1.8 series of Kubernetes. In addition to supporting the new features of Kubernetes 1.8, CDK also enables native cloud integration with AWS, native deployment and operations on VMWare, Canal as an additional networking choice, and support for the IBM Z and LinuxONE. \n Netplan by default \n Network configuration has over the years become fragmented between NetworkManager, ifupdown and other tools. 17.10 introduces  netplan \u00a0 as the standard declarative YAML syntax for configuring interfaces in Ubuntu. Netplan is backwards compatible, enabling interfaces to continue to be managed by tools like NetworkManager, while providing a simple overview of the entire system in a single place. New installations of Ubuntu 17.10 will use Netplan to drive systemd-networkd and NetworkManager. Desktop users will see their system fully managed by NetworkManager as in previous releases. On Ubuntu server and in the cloud, users now have their network devices assigned to systemd-networkd in netplan. Ifupdown remains supported; upgrades will continue to use ifupdown and it can be installed for new machines as needed. \n -Ends- \n About Canonical \nCanonical is the company behind Ubuntu, the leading OS for cloud operations.

Pike represents the 2nd release of OpenStack this year after Ocata was released back in February and it shows that the innovation and progress in OpenStack shows no signs of slowing just yet. With recent big announcements from Google, Amazon and VMware it is important that OpenStack continues to develop and offer a real, open alternative to public cloud platforms for organisations wanting to operate application infrastructure in house.\n New features: \n Pike updates have focused on manageability, flexibility and scale. Ubuntu OpenStack users \u00a0also benefit from updates to a number of key complementary technologies such as Ceph storage and OpenvSwitch. \n Manageability \n Thanks to updates of Cinder the block storage service of OpenStack, users get greater management of their data volumes, able to revert to a snapshot to recover from data loss or corruption. Volumes can also now be extended without rebooting a VM. \n Ironic, a bare metal service for OpenStack also now joins Cinder, Nova, Neutron and Swift in being able to support rolling upgrades. Whilst we have seen that for many uses cases, machines launched in OpenStack with LXD as a container hypervisor will deliver bare metal performance with greater security control and simplicity. For those who for one reason or another require Ironic, the ability to support rolling upgrades improves uptime during maintenance periods. \n Flexibility \n Users of Swift can now use a remote region to recover and even in the event of cross region network failure, individual regions can still function. \n Scalability \n Cells are an architectural implementation that breaks availability zones into units each with its own database and messaging server used to track state of the cloud. By splitting AZs in this way, centralised database and messaging services are no longer a bottleneck enabling larger pools of compute to be made available. In Pike more cells are supported and it is a great step to full CellsV2 support due in the next release of OpenStack known as Queens. \n Ubuntu OpenStack specific updates \n Now that we are over halfway through an LTS cycle OpenStack Pike gives us an opportunity to refresh many of the underlying operating system dependencies that OpenStack makes use of: \n QEMU \u2013 now refreshed to version 2.10 with improved NVMe support and handling of NUMA process scheduling. \n Libvirt 3.6.0 \u2013 many new features relating to use of libvirt with IBM pSeries servers and improvements in how hot plug events are handled with relation to vlans and OpenvSwitch \n Open vSwitch 2.8.0 \u2013 improvements to OVN including native active/passive HA support for ovn-northd, improvements to \u00a0network flow handling and improved support for DPDK (17.05.1) \n Ceph 12.2.0 \u2013\u00a0with Luminous also released this week it made sense to combine it with the release of Pike. Luminous has a new simple, built-in web-based dashboard for monitoring cluster status immediately improving usability. Luminous also uses Bluestore by default for ceph-osd meaning that a filesystem is no longer required. \n Access Pike now \n sudo add-apt-repository cloud-archive:pike \n New Charms for Pike will be released early next week giving users a clear way to upgrade from Ocata. \u00a0We\u2019ll post more details on that soon. \n]]> \n https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/09/01/openstack-pike-and-all-new-updates-to-the-cloud-archive/feed/ \n 0 \n Canonical expands enterprise Kubernetes \n https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/08/23/canonical-expands-enterprise-kubernetes/\n\t\t https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/08/23/canonical-expands-enterprise-kubernetes/#respond \n Wed, 23 Aug 2017 15:00:12 +0000 \n https://insights.ubuntu.com/?p=79155 \n Canonical supports enterprise Kubernetes on cloud and on-premises \n Two turnkey consulting packages for rapid deployment \n Support for Galactic Fog serverless, Rancher container management and Weave Cloud \n Reference architectures for Kubernetes operations on cloud or bare-metal \n LONDON, U.K, Aug 23rd, 2017 ,  Canonical  today announced two consulting packages for  enterprise Kubernetes  deployments, and expanded enterprise support to include serverless infrastructure from  Galactic Fog , container management workflows from  Rancher , and  Weave Cloud  from  Weaveworks . \n \u201cOrganisations looking for best-practice Kubernetes now have a reference architecture and specialist consulting to operate K8s on any cloud, bare metal, or virtualisation,\u201d said Marco Ceppi, product manager for Kubernetes at Canonical. \u201c Canonical Kubernetes  is transforming how our customers host scale out, cloud native workloads, with an emphasis on portability across public clouds and private infrastructure.\u201d \n \u2018Kubernetes Explorer\u2019 covers Kubernetes on a public cloud, private cloud or VMware.

Didier will be posting a series of blog posts next week on how this all works as they are landing. The vanilla upstream GNOME session will also emerge from this work. And we\u2019ll link to the posts in next week\u2019s newsletter, but keep an eye on social media for up-to-date information. \n We\u2019ve resurrected the \u201cpower off\u201d option when the power button is pressed. \u00a0This will appear in GNOME Control Center 3.25.90. \n Video, Audio, Bluetooth, Networking \n You might have seen this screenshot earlier in the week: \n We\u2019re testing some patches to Chromium 60 in Artful to enable video acceleration and we\u2019re seeing roughly a 50% saving in CPU overhead when using VA API. \u00a0In the screenshot above playing the video without acceleration is on the left and playing with acceleration is on the right. \u00a0The CPU is  Haswell . \u00a0There are still more bugs to fix, but we\u2019re making progress. \n In Pulse Audio we\u2019ve dropped some more patches for Android support (from Ubuntu Touch) bringing us more inline with upstream. \u00a0This will make maintenance easier and should reduce the chance of bugs cropping up from our patches. \n Our patches to add enabling and disabling of the Network Connectivity Checker are in review  upstream . \u00a0This will eventually add a toggle switch in the privacy settings of Control Center to allow you to turn on/off the connectivity checker. \u00a0We should be able to distro-patch these into Ubuntu soon before they appear upstream, and then drop the patches once they are available upstream. \n We\u2019re including the Rhythmbox \u201cAlternate Toolbar\u201d by default in 17.10, this brings a tidier user interface \n Updates \n Updated Chromium stable to 60.0.3112.78, pending validation. \u00a0The next Chromium stable update is 60.0.3112.90, already lined up in a PPA. \u00a0Updated Chromium beta to 61.0.3163.31, Chromium dev to 62.0.3175.4. \n Updating LibreOffice Snap to 5.4.0. \n Merged upstream Ghostscript version 9.21 from Debian into Ubuntu. \n Synced newest versions from Debian for hplip, cups-bjnp, ippusbxd. \u00a0System-config-printer updated to a new snapshot from upstream GIT. \n GNOME got a stack of updates to 3.25.90 (evolution, games, font viewer, online accounts, tweak tool, map, log, disk, calculator, cheese, todo) \n \u00a0 \n In The News \n We\u2019re planning a Fit And Finish hackfest in London at the end of August to find and fix all the niggly little bugs and theming issues. If you\u2019ve got skills to offer and would like to get involved please see  Popey\u2019s blog post . \n Softpedia also covers  this topic here . \n Linux Action News  discuss  the changes to the default session in 17.10. \n 16.04.3 was released last week. \u00a0OMG  covers the release here . \n OMG also have articles  on the dock \u00a0and the  Rhythmbox plugin \n Softpedia  discuss  Didier\u2019s blog post about the changes coming to the default session \n]]> \n https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/08/11/ubuntu-desktop-weekly-update-august-11-2017/feed/ \n 0 \n 68% of businesses are struggling to hire talent for IoT \n https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/08/09/68-of-businesses-are-struggling-to-hire-talent-for-iot/\n\t\t https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/08/09/68-of-businesses-are-struggling-to-hire-talent-for-iot/#respond \n Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:00:07 +0000 \n https://insights.ubuntu.com/?p=78740 \n Research from Canonical shows businesses are battling with drought in the \u201cInternet of Talent\u201d pool \n London, 9th August 2017  \u2013 Businesses are struggling to recruit employees with the skills needed to make the internet of things a success according to a new  IoT Business Models  report from Canonical \u2013 the makers of the IoT operating system,  Ubuntu Core . \n The report, which includes research from over 360 IoT professionals, developers and vendors found that 68% are struggling to find and recruit employees with relevant IoT expertise. \n According to Canonical\u2019s research, the most difficult to hire IoT employees are those with knowledge of big data and analytics, with 35% of IoT professionals saying they struggle to recruit this skillset. Knowledge of big data and analytics was also identified as the most important skillset for IoT professionals, with 75% deeming it a necessity for anyone claiming to be an IoT expert. The next most hard to find skillsets for IoT professionals are knowledge of embedded software development (33%), embedded electronics (32%), expertise in IT security (31%) and an understanding of AI (30%). \u00a0 \n Commenting on these findings, Mike Bell, EVP of IoT and Devices at Canonical said, \u201cWhen it comes to the internet of things, the business community is still overcoming a significant skills gap. Many businesses are concerned by their own lack of knowledge and skills within the IoT market and many business leaders are finding themselves running head first into a set of technology and business challenges that they do not yet fully understand. \n \u201cBusinesses need to realise that working in IoT should not require such an extensive variety of skills. What is needed, instead, is a simplification of the technologies behind IoT. Within the next five years we expect to see IoT technologies built into all aspects of the business environment. As edge computing brings connected intelligence directly to the shop floor, cloud computing will continue to drive back-end processes across the entire supply chain, for example. With all business processes growing increasingly connected, their supporting IoT technologies must be easy enough for anyone to manage, monitor and use \u2013 regardless of their background knowledge or personal skillset. \n \u201cAbove all, businesses must be agile when it comes to deciding on the \u2018right\u2019 people, skills and team to take them forward. What is decided upon today, is unlikely to remain the same in even one or two years, so constantly evaluating what change is needed and being able to execute this quickly is a must.\u201d To find out more about the IoT skills gap, download Canonical\u2019s  Defining IoT Business Models \u00a0report. \n ENDS \n Methodology \n The  Defining IoT Business Models  report incorporates original research, commissioned by Canonical and conducted by independent industry publication IoTNow.

That\u2019s according to a new  \u2018Defining IoT Business Models\u2019\u00a0 research whitepaper from Canonical \u2013 the company behind  Ubuntu Core , the IoT operating system. \n The report, which surveyed over 360 IoT professionals including developers, vendors, and enterprise users, highlights that \u2013 despite a widespread focus on IoT security \u2013 53% believe \u201cquantifying ROI and providing a clear use case\u201d is their most immediate IoT challenge. As an industry concern, this places defining the return on investment above both the lack of available infrastructure (40%) and the need for improved device security (45%). \n Despite the IoT industry now being valued at more than $900 billion1, it\u2019s clear that many businesses still don\u2019t understand how to turn a profit or gain genuine business benefits from the internet of things. According to Canonical\u2019s research, 34% of IoT professionals also believe that \u201cquantifying the business benefits\u201d of the internet of things should be their number one priority to encourage greater IoT adoption. \n Biggest immediate challenges faced by IoT professionals \n Quantifying ROI \u2013 53% \n Device security and privacy \u2013 45% \n Lack of IoT infrastructure \u2013 40% \n Lack of budget/investment in IoT \u2013 34% \n Ensuring integration with the wider ecosystem \u2013 29% \n Device management / long-term support \u2013 26% \n Resistance from within the organisation \u2013 25% \n Ensuring regular updates are installed \u2013 12% \n Commenting on these findings, Mike Bell, EVP of IoT and Devices at Canonical said, \u201cThe early internet of things was something of a gold rush, with vendors and developers jumping in to secure their share of an exciting and rapidly growing new market. Unfortunately, many of these businesses simply didn\u2019t understand or evaluate how the IoT was going to deliver value \u2013 and apparently \u2013 the majority still don\u2019t. \n \u201cAs we move towards 2018, businesses are looking for new ways to ensure that their investments in the IoT are driving financial growth and that their business models will remain sustainable in the years to come. At the forefront of this is a change in the way that businesses monetise the internet of things. Where once, people planned to monetise the IoT through device sales, we are now increasingly moving towards a software defined business model for IoT. With IoT specific operating systems, such as Ubuntu Core, allowing users to install new functionality onto their products, a growing number of businesses are now relying on IoT app stores to generate new revenues and increase their ROI. Through this new model, IoT users \u2013 whether corporate, industrial or consumer \u2013 can receive the latest features without having to buy a whole new device. This not only provides greater security and functionality for consumers, but also provides a long-term revenue source. With this in mind, businesses shouldn\u2019t need to see ROI as their biggest challenge for the IoT, if anything, it should be their biggest opportunity.\u201d \n To download Canonical\u2019s  Defining IoT Business Models  research whitepaper click  here . \n ENDS \n NOTES TO EDITORS \n McKinsey & Company, 2016 \n Methodology \n The Defining IoT Business Models report incorporates original research, commissioned by Canonical and conducted by independent industry publication IoTNow.
