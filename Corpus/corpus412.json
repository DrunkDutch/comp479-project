It might do this through  digital ,  analog  or  mixed-mode   electronics . Sound chips normally contain things like  oscillators ,  envelope  controllers,  samplers ,  filters  and  amplifiers . During the late 20th century, sound chips were widely used in  arcade game   system boards ,  video game consoles ,  home computers , and  PC   sound cards . \n Contents \n 1   Programmable sound generators (PSG) \n 1.1   Atari \n 1.2   General Instrument \n 1.3   Konami \n 1.4   MOS Technology \n 1.5   Oki \n 1.6   Philips \n 1.7   Ricoh \n 1.8   Sega \n 1.9   Sunsoft \n 1.10   Texas Instruments \n 1.11   Yamaha \n 2   Wavetable synthesis \n 2.1   Atari \n 2.2   Ensoniq \n 2.3   Hudson Soft/Epson \n 2.4   Konami \n 2.5   Namco \n 3   Frequency modulation (FM) synthesis \n 3.1   Atari \n 3.2   ESS Technology \n 3.3   Konami \n 3.4   Yamaha \n 4   Pulse-code modulation (PCM, sample-based) \n 4.1   Atari \n 4.2   Crystal Semiconductor \n 4.3   Drucegrove \n 4.4   Harris \n 4.5   MOS Technology \n 4.6   Namco \n 4.7   National SemiConductor \n 4.8   Oki \n 4.9   Ricoh \n 4.10   Sanyo \n 4.11   Sega \n 4.12   Sony \n 5   See also \n 6   References \n 7   External links \n Programmable sound generators (PSG) [ edit ] \n See also:  Programmable sound generator \n Atari [ edit ] \n Atari TIA , combined sound and  graphics chip , used in the  Atari 2600  and  Atari 7800  video game consoles and in  Video Music , a music visualizer for TV. \n Atari POKEY , used in  Atari 8-bit  home computers, the  Atari 5200  console, and certain Atari 7800 cartridges. \n Atari AMY , intended for the 65XEM, but never released. \n General Instrument [ edit ] \n General Instrument AY-3-8910 , used in arcade boards ( DECO , [1]   Taito Z80 , [2]   Konami Scramble , [3]   Irem M27 , [4]   Konami 6809 , [5]   Capcom Z80 [6] ), computers ( Colour Genie ,  Oric 1 ,  MSX ,  Amstrad CPC ,  ZX Spectrum  with 128K RAM,  Elektor TVGC  and  Mockingboard ), and the  Intellivision  home console. \n General Instrument SP0250 ,  LPC  (linear predictive coding)  speech synthesis  chip used in the  Sega G80  arcade system board. \n General Instrument SP0256 , LPC speech synthesis chip. \n Konami [ edit ] \n Konami RC , used in the  Konami Scramble [7]  and  Gyruss [8]  arcade system boards. \n Konami VRC6 , used in certain Konami-produced  Famicom  cartridges. \n MOS Technology [ edit ] \n MOS Technology 6560/6561  \"VIC\", used in the  Commodore VIC-1001 and VIC-20 . \n MOS Technology 6581/8580  \"SID\", used in the  Commodore 64  and  Commodore 128 . \n MOS Technology 7360/8360  \"TED\", used in the  Commodore 16  and  Commodore Plus/4 . \n Oki [ edit ] \n Oki   MSM5232 \n Philips [ edit ] \n Philips SAA1099 , used in the  SAM Coup\u00e9  and  Creative Music System  (also known as Game Blaster). \n Ricoh [ edit ] \n Ricoh 2A03/2A07 , used in the  Nintendo Entertainment System /Famicom  home console  (hardware expandable) and the arcade game  Punch-Out!! \n Sega [ edit ] \n Sega Melody Generator, used in the  Sega G80  arcade system board.
