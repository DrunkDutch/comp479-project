My experience [with Cosmotown] has been excellent. \n Troy Wilkinson \n Thanks for the great service and free domain privacy.  Almost went with GoDaddy, until I went to checkout and found they charge 9.99/yr just for private registration.  That's more than you charge for the domain registration! \n Private \n The domain pricing is awesome, and the customer care is the best I have seen in 15 years!  I am a customer for life!!!  THANK YOU Cosmotown, for letting me focus on my music... you ROCK! \n Carrie Lynn Grayson \n * If you find a lower regular price within 12 months of registering your domain with Cosmotown, we will refund you double the difference in price.  Only other registrars' regular pricing applies, promotional pricing, coupon pricing, limited time offers etc are excluded.  Whois Privacy is free for as long as your domain is registered with Cosmotown, on domains extensions that allow Whois Privacy.  Certain domain extensions do not allow Whois Privacy due to registry restrictions, such as country code TLDs (.cc, .asia etc).
