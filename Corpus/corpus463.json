Madhva divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ( Mukti-yogyas ), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration ( Nitya-samsarins ), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal  hell  or  Andhatamas  ( Tamo-yogyas ). [1] \n Mukti-yogyas are  Jivas  or souls who are receptive to spiritual values, and through repeated embodiments they evolve into better and better men, and finally through concentrated spiritual discipline and God's grace attain salvation. \n References [ edit ] \n ^   Tapasyananda, Swami.
