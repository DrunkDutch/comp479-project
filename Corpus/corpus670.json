She is the author of seven novels, including  Adam Bede  (1859),  The Mill on the Floss  (1860),  Silas Marner  (1861),  Middlemarch  (1871\u201372), and  Daniel Deronda  (1876), most of which are set in provincial England and known for their  realism  and psychological insight. \n She used a male pen name, she said, to ensure that her works would be taken seriously. Female authors were published under their own names during Eliot's lifetime, but she wanted to escape the stereotype of women's writing being limited to lighthearted romances. She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as an editor and critic. Another factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny, thus avoiding the scandal that would have arisen because of her adulterous relationship with the married  George Henry Lewes . [1] \n Eliot's  Middlemarch  has been described by  Martin Amis [2]  and  Julian Barnes [3]  as the greatest novel in the English language. \n Contents \n 1   Life \n 1.1   Early life and education \n 1.2   Move to Coventry \n 1.3   Move to London and editorship of the  Westminster Review \n 1.4   Relationship with George Lewes \n 1.5   First publication \n 1.6   Marriage to John Cross and death \n 2   Literary assessment \n 3   Works \n 3.1   Novels \n 3.2   Poetry \n 3.3   Other \n 4   Notes \n 5   Further reading \n 5.1   Context and background \n 5.2   Critical studies \n 6   External links \n Life [ edit ] \n Early life and education [ edit ] \n Mary Ann Evans was born in  Nuneaton , Warwickshire, England. She was the second child of Robert Evans (1773\u20131849) and Christiana Evans ( n\u00e9e  Pearson, 1788\u20131836), the daughter of a local mill-owner. Mary Ann's name was sometimes shortened to Marian. [4]  Her full siblings were Christiana, known as Chrissey (1814\u201359), Isaac (1816\u20131890), and twin brothers who survived a few days in March 1821. She also had a half-brother, Robert (1802\u201364), and half-sister, Fanny (1805\u201382), from her father's previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (?1780\u20131809). Her father Robert Evans, of Welsh ancestry, was the manager of the  Arbury Hall  Estate for the  Newdigate family  in Warwickshire, and Mary Ann was born on the estate at South Farm. In early 1820 the family moved to a house named  Griff House , between  Nuneaton  and  Bedworth . \n The young Evans was obviously intelligent, a voracious reader. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, Evans was thus not thought to have much chance of marriage, and because of her intelligence, her father invested in an education not often afforded women. [5]  From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham's school in  Attleborough , from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington's school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin's school in  Coventry . At Mrs. Wallington's school, she was taught by the  evangelical  Maria Lewis \u2014 to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Miss Franklin's school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism. [6] \n After age sixteen, Evans had little formal education. [7]  Thanks to her father's important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that \"George Eliot's novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy\". [8]  Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a  low church   Anglican  family, but at that time the  Midlands  was an area with a growing number of  religious dissenters . \n Move to Coventry [ edit ] \n In 1836 her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, but she continued correspondence with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to  Foleshill  near  Coventry . The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray.  Charles Bray  had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the progressive, free-thinking Brays, whose \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays' house included  Robert Owen ,  Herbert Spencer ,  Harriet Martineau , and  Ralph Waldo Emerson . Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal theologies and to writers such as  David Strauss  and  Ludwig Feuerbach , who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical stories. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss's  The Life of Jesus  (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\"; later she translated Feuerbach\u2019s  The Essence of Christianity  (1854). As a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans's earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the  Coventry Herald and Observer . [9] \n When Evans began to question her religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father's funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in  Geneva  alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends Fran\u00e7ois and Juliet d'Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that \"one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree\". Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. Fran\u00e7ois Durade painted her portrait there as well. [10] \n Move to London and editorship of the  Westminster Review [ edit ] \n On her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of  John Chapman , the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal  The Westminster Review , and Evans became its assistant editor in 1851. Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the Review in the first half of 1854. [11] \n Women writers were common at the time, but Evans's role as the female editor of a literary magazine was quite unusual. She was not considered to be a beautiful or even an attractive woman. According to Henry James: \n She had a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth full of uneven teeth and a chin and jawbone  qui n'en finissent pas ... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes, steals forth and charms the mind, so that you end, as I ended, in falling in love with her. Yes, behold me in love with this great horse-faced bluestocking . [12] \n During this period, she formed a number of embarrassing, unreciprocated emotional attachments, including one with Chapman (who was married but lived with both his wife and his mistress), and another with  Herbert Spencer . \n Relationship with George Lewes [ edit ] \nPortrait of George Eliot by  Samuel Laurence , c. 1860 \n The philosopher and critic  George Henry Lewes  (1817\u201378) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis. They had an  open marriage . In addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by  Thornton Leigh Hunt . [13]  Because Lewes allowed himself to be falsely named as the father on the birth certificates of Jervis's illegitimate children, he was considered to be complicit in adultery, and therefore he was not legally able to divorce her. In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to  Weimar  and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach's  The Essence of Christianity , and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of  Baruch Spinoza 's  Ethics , which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime. [14] \n The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, and they now considered themselves married, with Evans calling herself Mary Ann Evans Lewes, and referring to Lewes as her husband. It was not unusual for men and women in Victorian society to have affairs;  Charles Bray , John Chapman,  Friedrich Engels , and  Wilkie Collins  all had extra-marital relationships, though they were much more discreet than Lewes and Evans were. It was this lack of discretion and their public admission of the relationship which created accusations of polygamy and earned them the moral disapproval of English society. \n First publication [ edit ] \nPhotograph ( albumen print ) of George Eliot, c. 1865 \n While continuing to contribute pieces to the  Westminster Review , Evans resolved to become a novelist, and she set out a manifesto for herself in one of her last essays for the  Review , \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\" [15]  (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction by women. In other essays, she praised the  realism  of novels that were being written in Europe at the time, and it became clear in her subsequent fiction that she placed an emphasis on realistic storytelling. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, the one for which she would become known: George Eliot. This pen-name was said by some to be an homage to George Lewes. In addition to adopting his first name, the last name, Eliot, could possibly have been a code for \"to L\u2014I owe it\". [16] \n In 1857, when she was 37, \"The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton\", the first of the  Scenes of Clerical Life , was published in  Blackwood's Magazine  and, along with the other  Scenes , it was well received (it was published in book form early in 1858). Her first complete novel, published in 1859, was  Adam Bede ; it was an instant success, but it prompted intense interest in who this new author might be.  Scenes of Clerical Life  was widely believed to have been written by a country  parson  or perhaps the wife of a parson. With the release of the incredibly popular  Adam Bede , speculation increased, and there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. In the end, the real George Eliot stepped forward: Marian Evans Lewes admitted she was the author. The revelations about Eliot's private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Eliot's relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she so badly needed to write fiction, and to ease her self-doubt, but it would be some time before they were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to  Princess Louise , the daughter of  Queen Victoria . The queen herself was an avid reader of all of George Eliot's novels and was so impressed with  Adam Bede  that she commissioned the artist  Edward Henry Corbould  to paint scenes from the book. [17] \nBlue plaque, Holly Lodge, 31 Wimbledon Park Road, London \n After the success of  Adam Bede , Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing  Adam Bede , she finished  The Mill on the Floss , dedicating the manuscript: \"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.\" \n Her last novel was  Daniel Deronda , published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to  Witley , Surrey. By this time Lewes's health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next two years editing Lewes's final work,  Life and Mind , for publication, and she found solace and companionship with  John Walter Cross , a Scottish commission agent [18]  whose mother had recently died. \n Marriage to John Cross and death [ edit ] \nEliot's grave in  Highgate Cemetery \n On 16 May 1880 Eliot courted controversy once more by marrying John Cross, a man twenty years her junior, and again changing her name, this time to Mary Anne Cross. The legal marriage at least pleased her brother Isaac, who had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, but now sent congratulations. While the couple was honeymooning in  Venice , Cross, in a fit of depression, jumped from the hotel balcony into the  Grand Canal . He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This, coupled with the kidney disease she had been afflicted with for several years, led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61. [19] \n Eliot was not buried in  Westminster Abbey  because of her denial of the Christian faith and her \"irregular\" though monogamous life with Lewes. She was buried in  Highgate Cemetery  (East), Highgate, London, in the area reserved for religious dissenters and agnostics, beside the love of her life,  George Henry Lewes . [20]  In 1980, on the centenary of her death, a memorial stone was established for her in the  Poets' Corner . \n Several buildings in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named after her or titles of her novels. These include The George Eliot School (previously George Eliot Community School) and Middlemarch Junior School. In 1948, Nuneaton Emergency Hospital was renamed George Eliot Hospital in her honour. [21]  George Eliot Road, in  Foleshill , Coventry, was also named in her honour. \n A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street, Nuneaton, and  Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery  has a display of artifacts related to her. \n Literary assessment [ edit ] \nPortrait by  Frederick William Burton , 1864 \n Throughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From  Adam Bede  to  The Mill on the Floss  and  Silas Marner , Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution.  Felix Holt, the Radical  and  The Legend of Jubal  were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of  Middlemarch , in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the  Reform Bill of 1832 ; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of  John Ruskin 's  Modern Painters  in  Westminster Review  in 1856. \n Readers in the Victorian era praised her novels for their depictions of rural society. Much of the material for her prose was drawn from her own experience. She shared with  Wordsworth  the belief that there was much value and beauty to be found in the mundane details of ordinary country life. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to stories of the English countryside.  Romola , an historical novel set in late fifteenth century  Florence , was based on the life of the Italian priest  Girolamo Savonarola . In  The Spanish Gypsy , Eliot made a foray into verse, but her poetry's initial popularity has not endured. \n Working as a translator, Eliot was exposed to German texts of religious, social, and moral philosophy such as Friedrich Strauss\u2019s  Life of Jesus , Feuerbach\u2019s  The Essence of Christianity , and Spinoza\u2019s  Ethics . Elements from these works show up in her fiction, much of which is written with her trademark sense of  agnostic   humanism . She had taken particular notice of Feuerbach\u2019s conception of Christianity, positing that our understanding of the nature of the divine was to be found ultimately in the nature of humanity projected onto a divine figure. An example of this philosophy appeared in her novel  Romola , in which Eliot\u2019s protagonist displayed a \u201csurprisingly modern readiness to interpret religious language in humanist or secular ethical terms.\u201d [22]  Though Eliot herself was not religious, she had respect for religious tradition and its ability to maintain a sense of social order and morality. The religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from  The Mill on the Floss  sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans. Eliot also faced a quandary similar to that of Silas Marner, whose alienation from the church simultaneously meant his alienation from society. Because Eliot retained a vestigial respect for religion, German philosopher  Friedrich Nietzsche  excoriated her system of morality for figuring sin as a debt that can be expiated through suffering, which he demeaned as characteristic of \"little moralistic females \u00e0 la Eliot.\" [23] \n She was at her most autobiographical in  Looking Backwards , part of her final published work  Impressions of Theophrastus Such . By the time of  Daniel Deronda , Eliot's sales were falling off, and she had faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the posthumous biography written by her husband, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly, woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by  Virginia Woolf , who called  Middlemarch  \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\". [24]  In 1994, literary critic  Harold Bloom   placed Eliot among the most important Western writers of all time . [25]  In a 2007 authors' poll by  TIME ,  Middlemarch  was voted the tenth greatest literary work ever written. [26]  In 2015, writers from outside the UK voted it first among all British novels \"by a landslide\". [27]  The various film and television adaptations of Eliot's books have re-introduced her to the wider reading public. \n Works [ edit ] \n Novels [ edit ] \n Adam Bede , 1859 \n The Mill on the Floss , 1860 \n Silas Marner , 1861 \n Romola , 1863 \n Felix Holt, the Radical , 1866 \n Middlemarch , 1871\u201372 \n Daniel Deronda , 1876 \n Poetry [ edit ] \n Agatha , 1869 \n Brother and Sister , 1869 \n Armgart , 1871 \n Stradivarius , 1873 \n The Legend of Jubal , 1874 \n I Grant You Ample Leave , 1874 \n Arion , 1874 \n A Minor Prophet , 1874 \n A College Breakfast Party , 1879 \n The Death of Moses , 1879 \n From a London Drawing Room \n Count That Day Lost \n Other [ edit ] \n Digital facsimile of manuscript  \"Quarry for Middlemarch\" , MS Lowell 13, Houghton Library, Harvard University \n Translation of  Das Leben Jesu, kritisch bearbeitet (The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined)   Volume 2  by  David Strauss , 1846 \n Translation of  Das Wesen des Christentums (The Essence of Christianity)  by  Ludwig Feuerbach , 1854 \n \"Three Months in Weimar\" , 1855 \n \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\" , 1856 \n \"The Natural History of German Life\" , 1856 \n Scenes of Clerical Life , 1857\n The Sad Fortunes of the Rev.
