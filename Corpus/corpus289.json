Now, it\u2019s a simple toggle. \n There\u2019s just one catch:\u00a0it doesn\u2019t apply to every Windows application. But we\u2019ve got you covered. Here\u2019s how to get your whole desktop (or as much as possible) looking dark. \n Enable Dark Mode for Windows 10 Settings and Apps \n To enable the new dark theme, head to Settings > Personalization >\u00a0Colors. Scroll down and select \u201cDark\u201d under \u201cChoose your app mode\u201d. \n The Settings application itself will immediately turn dark, as will many other \u201cUniversal Windows Platform\u201d applications. However, it\u2019s up to each developer to support the dark theme, and some applications will continue using their normal colors. \n This option also doesn\u2019t affect desktop applications, including Windows 10\u2019s File Explorer, which will remain white. \n Enable the Dark Theme in Microsoft Edge \n The MIcrosoft Edge web browser included with Windows 10 also has a dark theme. However, its dark theme option is entirely separate from the main option in Settings\u2026for some reason. \n To activate a dark theme in Edge, open the Microsoft Edge web browser, open the menu, and select \u201cSettings\u201d. Select \u201cDark\u201d under \u201cChoose a theme\u201d. \n You can also choose to set your theme separately in the\u00a0Groove music player and Movies & TV video player apps. However, they\u2019ll just use your system theme setting by default. You don\u2019t have to change the\u00a0setting manually, as you do with Edge. \n Enable the\u00a0Dark Theme in Microsoft Office \n Microsoft Office 2016 also contains a dark theme that isn\u2019t enabled by default, and must be manually enabled. \n To enable it, open an Office application like Word or Excel and head to File > Options. On the General tab, click the \u201cOffice Theme\u201d box under \u201cPersonalize your copy of Microsoft Office\u201d and select the \u201cBlack\u201d office theme. \n Your theme choice will apply to all Office\u00a0applications. So, if you set this option in Word and later open Excel, Excel will also be using a dark theme. \n Install Dark Themes for Chrome, Firefox, and Other Applications \n Many other Windows desktop applications have their own theming options and theming engines. For example, to use a dark theme in Google Chrome, you\u2019ll need to head to Google\u2019s  Chrome themes site \u00a0and install a dark theme. For Firefox, you\u2019ll need to head to Mozilla\u2019s\u00a0 Firefox themes site  and install a dark theme. \n For example, we installed the  Morpheon Dark theme  for Chrome. It makes Chrome look much more at home on a dark-themed desktop. \n Check to see whether the applications you frequently use offer their own theme options. \n Enable a\u00a0Dark Theme for Windows Desktop Applications \n The real problem with the new \u201cdark mode\u201d setting is that it doesn\u2019t affect the Windows desktop theme at all. Desktop applications like File Explorer will continue using the normal, light theme. \n Windows does have a built-in dark theme for desktop applications, but it probably isn\u2019t ideal. To enable it, open the Control Panel and head to Appearance and Personalization > Change the Theme. Scroll down and choose one of the High Contrast themes, such as \u201cHigh Contrast Black\u201d. \n This will make applications like File Explorer have a dark background. However, they won\u2019t look all that great\u2013high contrast themes are an accessibility feature designed to increase contrast so the screen is easier to read and understand. They don\u2019t look as slick as a modern dark theme would. \n RELATED ARTICLE How to Install Custom Themes and Visual Styles in Windows \n If you want a slicker dark theme for File Explorer and other desktop applications, you\u2019ll have to go a bit off the beaten path. You\u2019ll need to bypass the normal protection against using third-party themes\u2013or \u201cvisual styles\u201d\u2013 in Windows. You can then hunt down a third-party dark theme you like. Follow  our guide to installing third-party visual styles on Windows  for more help. \n For example, we installed  UxStyle  and the  Windows 10 \u2013 Dark Edition \u00a0visual style. There are many other dark themes you could choose. A theme like this one\u00a0makes File Explorer and other applications look darker and fit in better, although there are still parts of Windows desktop applications that themes don\u2019t (and can\u2019t) modify. Just make sure you back up before installing something like this, as you\u2019re messing with system files. \n Like many parts of Windows 10, the new dark theme\u2013or dark \u201capp mode\u201d\u2013feels incomplete. Microsoft could\u00a0include a dark theme option for Windows desktop applications and the interface would look more cohesive. Perhaps Microsoft\u00a0plans on replacing File Explorer with a new, Universal Windows Platform-based file manager in a future update to Windows 10. For now, though, this is what we\u2019ve got. \n Share: \n Comments: \n 13 \n Chris Hoffman  is a technology writer and all-around computer geek.
