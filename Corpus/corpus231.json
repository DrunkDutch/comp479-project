Do this carefully and correctly. \n Steps Edit \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/97\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/97\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 1 \n Turn off the infected computer.  Open the case and  remove its main hard drive  (the one containing the OS partition).\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/ef\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/ef\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 2 \n If you have a USB/IEEE1394 external drive enclosure, you may connect the infected drive to that instead of completing the next two steps. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d9\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d9\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 3 \n Turn off the clean computer.  Open the case and connect the infected drive.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 4 \n Turn on the clean computer.  Make absolutely sure that it boots into the clean OS, not from the infected drive! Most PCs have a boot choice menu which can be accessed via the F11 or ESC key soon after power on.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/77\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-5-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 5 \n Make sure you can see all files.  Once the clean computer's OS has booted, you are going to want to clean out temp files from the infected drive, in order to make it easier to search. But first, you want to see all files, even hidden and system files. Go to \"Control Panel\" -> \"Folder Options\", and click on the \"View\" tab at the top of the \"Folder Options\" window. You are going to want to change the following options:\n Turn ON: Put a check in check box to display the contents of System Folders \n Turn ON: Select to show hidden files and folders \n Turn OFF: Uncheck hide extensions for known file types. \n Turn OFF: Uncheck hide protected operating system files (Recommended) \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ad\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ad\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 6 \n Take note of the drive letter of your infected drive.  It's probably going to be E: or F:, depending on the number of hard drives, partitions, and CD/DVD drives you have in your clean computer. Let's assume that we're dealing with the F: drive for this article.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/32\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/32\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 7 \n Clear your temporary file folders.  Once your temporary files folders have been cleared, there are a lot fewer files to search through. This should make the next few steps a bit less tiresome. Some of the following locations may not exist, some may be in slightly different places. It's important that you find and clear the cache for all of your browsers (IE/Netscape/Firefox/Opera) and that you clear it for every single user! Check the following folders and delete their contents, but not the directories themselves.\n F:\\TEMP \n F:\\Windows\\TEMP or F:\\WINNT\\Temp (Only NT4 and Windows 2000 use \"WinNT\") \n F:\\WINNT\\Profiles\\UserName\\Local Settings\\Temp \n F:\\WINNT\\Profiles\\UserName\\Local Settings\\Temporary Internet Files \n F:\\WINNT\\Profiles\\UserName\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\SomeRandomName.default\\Cache \n F:\\Documents and Settings\\UserName\\Local Settings\\Temp \n F:\\Documents and Settings\\UserName\\Local Settings\\Temporary Internet Files \n F:\\Documents and Settings\\UserName\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\SomeRandomName.default\\Cache \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/46\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/46\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 8 \n Make sure your recycle bin is empty of all files. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6b\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6b\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 9 \n Try backing up the drive that is infected to a folder on the clean part of the computer, only if you have enough space for that.  If you can back up the whole entire drive,you should . Otherwise, you should be able to get away with just the \"Documents and Settings\" folder (\"Profiles\" under NT4) and maybe a few of the folders for your computer games, (some games do store their saved games,their maps , high scores, etc in their program folder).\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/38\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/38\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 10 \n Perform completely full antivirus and spyware scans of your computer.  This will hopefully find some things on the infected F: drive and remove them.\n Download and install both  Spybot Search and Destroy  and  Lavasoft Adaware . It is important that you use both of these utilities, as they will often find more malware together. \n Update definition files when prompted. \n Scan your machine (this could take a while). \n Remove any spyware that is found. \n Make sure you have an antivirus program installed and up-to-date. Perform a full scan in your system and remove any viruses, trojans, and worms the program finds. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c4\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c4\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 11 \n When all the scans for malware are complete, go to \"C: \\Program Files\" (on your clean PC's drive) and copy the entire program directories that are for for Spybot, Ad-Aware, and your anti-virus to a new directory on your drive that is infected , called \"F:\\Cleaners\". Also copy the installers for these programs to the \"F:\\Cleaners\" folder. You may need them any time later.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f8\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f8\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-12-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 12 \n Hit a Windows Key+F to bring up the files finding window.  If you see a little animated dog, you may want to turn him off, because he makes searching a lot more annoying. The search options you will want to use for the searches we will perform are \"Search for All files and folders\" with the following \"Advanced Options\" turned ON:\n Search system folders \n Search hidden files and folders \n Search your subfolders \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 13 \n Look only in the F: \\ drive for file names matching \"*.exe\" and which have been modified in the past week. Simply enter \"*.exe\"\u00a0: \"asterisk period exe\", and specify \"within the last week.\" You may want to try searching for \"past month\" also , depending upon how long your computer has been infected.\n Run the search. Let it run until it completes. \n Examine the files that it has found. Some of them you may recognize, especially if you have recently installed certain programs. For example, if you recently upgraded or installed Lavasoft Ad-Aware, you may see\"F:\\Program Files\\Lavasoft\\Ad-Aware SE Personal\\Ad-Aware.exe\" in these lists. Ignore this type of file. The kind of file you're looking for is usually in F:\\Windows\\system32, less than 100KB in its size , and has a funny name like \"lkaljya.exe\" \n Any files you find should be moved into a temporary directory until you can verify that they are legit. For example, you can create a folder \"F:\\quarantine\" and move them into a subfolder \"F:\\quarantine\\Windows\\system32\" in there. \n Some malicious files are also sneakily hidden in the F:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers directory they will also have funny names like \"lkaljya.sys\". \n Any files you find should be moved into a temporary directory until you can verify that they are legit. For example, you can create a folder \"F:\\quarantine\" and move them to a subfolder \"F:\\quarantine\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\" in there. \n If you have an on-access anti-virus program, it may actually start complaining that it found a trojan the second you select the suspect file. If it does, then don't bother quarantining it, just let the antivirus remove it. \n Pay particular attention to *.exe files with either random or pretentious names. Pretentious names try to appear important by being very close to actual real useful programs. For example, a useful program is \"svchost.exe\", while a suspect program could be \"scvhost.exe\" \n Another good way of identifying good products and bad is by right-clicking the executable and clicking \"Properties\", then by choosing the \"Version\" tab (if there is one available). If the file is digitally signed by any company , it will have a \"Company Name\" property on this certain tab, for example \"Microsoft Corporation\" or \"Apple Computer Inc\" or \"Logitech\", etc. These files are probably safe and secure and good. If the file is not signed, then you should investigate further, and more. \n When in doubt, go to google and type the full name of the suspect executable: \"scvhost.exe\", for example. Examine the search results. Often you will see links like \"scvhost.exe, good or bad?\" or \"What does this file do?\" and you can see whether or not it is a necessary file or a dangerous trojan. \n Pay particular attention to any *.exe files you find in F:\\windows\\system32 and (especially) anywhere in F:\\Documents and Settings. There really shouldn't be many/any executables in the \"Documents and Settings\" folder. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6e\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 14 \n Repeat the previous step, but search for file names matching the pattern \"*.dll\" instead ok? .\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8c\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8c\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 15 \n Repeat the previous step, but search for file names matching the pattern \"*.sys\" instead of that. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ae\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ae\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-16-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 16 \n This last step is fairly complicated, but is usually successful at getting rid of most of the most stubborn worms and trojans, they are so despicable .  Pay close and lots attention and don't screw up.\n Go to Start->Run and type \"regedit\" and press enter. \n Load the \"SOFTWARE\" hive from the infected computer and remove any bad \"run on login\" entries.\n Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE by left-clicking it. \n Go to the File menu and click on \"Load Hive\". \n Navigate to F:\\Windows\\System32\\Config and load the file named \"SOFTWARE\". \n It will ask you for a key name. So type \"INFECTED_SOFTWARE\" and press enter. \n Click the plus sign on the side of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to reveal the key of \"INFECTED_SOFTWARE\". \n Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\INFECTED_SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. \n Back it up!!!!!! Right-click on \"Run\" and choose \"Export Data\" and save this file \"INFECTED_SOFTWARE,RUN.reg\" in the folder of quarantine . Note that if you need to restore this backup thing later on, while the  infected  computer is still running, you'll have to open the reg file in a text editor and slightly change the key path. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\INFECTED_SOFTWARE would need to be changed to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE, for example. If you merely want to immediately restore this reg file while running on the computer that is clean, you don't have to edit this file; just be 100% sure that the hive is still currently loaded and double-click the reg file so you can re-insert its keys/values into the places that are appropriate. \n In the right pane you should see a list of lots of # entries. Some of these may include programs such as Java Update, AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger / Windows Live Messenger, ICQ, Trillian, nVidia / ATI drivers, Sound drivers, Keyboard / Mouse drivers, Antivirus, Firewall software, etc. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/46\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/46\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 17 \n Once again, use your best judgment and the methods described earlier for differentiating good from bad.  If you determine that something is bad, grab the EXE file pointed to by the key and throw it into the folder for quarantine, and delete the key. You can always restore it later using the registry backup.\n Perform the same steps in \"RunOnce\" and \"RunOnceEx\", right next to the \"Run\" key. They may or may not have entries in them. \n When you are done, it is important that you click on the \"INFECTED_SOFTWARE\" and then go to the File menu and choose \"Unload Hive\". \n Load the \"DEFAULT\" hive from the infected computer (F:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\DEFAULT) and remove any bad \"run on login\" entries. Use the same steps as in the \"SOFTWARE\" step. Note: the \"DEFAULT\" hive may not even have a \"Run\" key. If that's the case, skip it. Be sure to unload \"INFECTED_DEFAULT\" when you're done. \n Load each user's hive from the infected drive. You will find the hive at F:\\Documents and Settings\\UserName\\NTUSER.DAT -- load it as \"INFECTED_USERNAME\" and then go through its \"Run/RunOnce/RunOnceEx\" keys for bad entries. You know the drill by now, right? Be sure to unload each hive when you're done. \n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ac\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/ac\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 18 \n If you're using an external hard drive enclosure, use \"Safely Remove Hardware\" to remove it from your PC, turn it off, and remove the (hopefully, by now) cleaned drive.  Otherwise, you need to power down your clean PC and remove the cleaned drive from the case.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f6\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-19-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-19-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f6\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-19-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-19-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 19 \n Reinstall the cleaned drive in its own case and power on your cleaned PC. \n If your PC absolutely refuses to boot at this point, you may have no choice but to wipe the drive clean and  reinstall Windows .

Also run your currently installed anti-virus program, or try running your anti-virus program from the \"Cleaners\" folder; it may or may not work.\n {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/11\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-21.jpg\\/v4-460px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-21.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/11\\/Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-21.jpg\\/v4-760px-Remove-Spyware-Manually-%28Windows%29-Step-21.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570} \n 21 \n If you're certain that you have removed all malware, you may continue using your Windows install.  However, if performance is unacceptable, you may have no choice but to reinstall. Some malware is so persistent that it's less effort to simply start over with a clean slate.\n Advertisement \n Community Q&A \n Search \n Add New Question \n Ask a Question \n 200 characters left \n Submit \n Tips Edit \n Windows NT and Windows 2000 use a \"WINNT\" folder instead of a \"WINDOWS\" folder. \n 0 \n Helpful? \n \u00a0 0 \n A much easier method is to boot the infected Windows computer with Linux on a CD or USB drive. Then run a Windows Anti-virus program while operating the computer using a Linux operating system. Many older computers can easily run Linux which is secure and can do most tasks. \n 1 \n Helpful? \n \u00a0 0 \n Completely avoid warez, crack, and porn websites (unless you are running a Unix based OS such as Linux or Solaris) - they are hotbeds for things to infect your computer. If you must, use Firefox with Adblock and Noscript turned on. \n 0 \n Helpful? \n \u00a0 0 \n Windows 95/98/ME probably, especially 95 and 98 to a lesser extent, are not worth repairing. Just backup, clean them out and reinstall. \n 0 \n Helpful? \n \u00a0 0 \n If you do not have another computer, get Malwarebytes Chameleon. This will terminate any viruses running. \n 0 \n Helpful? \n \u00a0 0 \n When you get a new computer set it up be dual boot. That means install two operating systems on the same computer. When Windows gets infected with a virus you can choose to boot the computer with the other operating system and do the repair. Ubuntu is one of the types of Linux that makes this easy to set up. \n 0 \n Helpful? \n \u00a0 0 \n Add \n Warnings Edit \n Don't delete files unless you're sure they're bad.
