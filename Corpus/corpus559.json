The river is some 12 miles (19\u00a0km) long, of which the last 4 miles (6\u00a0km) are tidal. Unusually, the entire river, including its bed, is owned by  Lord Montagu of Beaulieu . \n The Beaulieu River rises near  Lyndhurst  ( SU295090 ) in the centre of the New Forest, and flows east and then south across the forest heaths to the village of  Beaulieu . At Beaulieu the river becomes  tidal  and once drove a  tide mill  in the village. Below Beaulieu the tidal river continues to flow south-east through the Forest, passing the village of  Bucklers Hard  and entering the sea at the  Solent  ( SZ4397 ). \n The tidal river below Beaulieu village is navigable to small craft. Bucklers Hard was once a significant  shipbuilding  centre, building many wooden sailing ships, both merchant and naval, including  Nelson's   Agamemnon . \n Since 2000 the navigable channel at the entrance to the river has been marked by a lighthouse known as the Millennium Lighthouse or the Beaulieu River Beacon. [2] [3] \n For its final kilometre, it is separated from The Solent by a raised area of salt marsh known as  Gull Island . \n Contents \n 1   Etymology \n 2   Film appearances \n 3   Gallery \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n Etymology [ edit ] \n The current name \"Beaulieu\" is  French , meaning \"beautiful place\". \n The original name, \"Exe\", is  Brythonic , deriving from the  Ancient British  word * Iska  meaning \"fishes\" or \"fish-place\" and  cognate  with the modern Welsh word  Pysg  (fishes).This derivation applies to many similarly named rivers throughout Britain including the  Axe ,  Exe  and  Usk , with the names evolving local distinctions over the centuries. \n Film appearances [ edit ] \n The river was used as a backdrop for some scenes of the 1966 film  A Man for All Seasons  \u2013 the tree-lined waters were used to portray the 16th century  River Thames .
