{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Harry_Potter", "content": "Politics of Harry Potter - Wikipedia \n Politics of  Harry Potter   \n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\t navigation , \t\t\t\t\t search \n There are many published theories about  politics  in the  Harry Potter  books by  J. K. Rowling , which range from them containing criticism of racism to anti-government sentiments. According to  Inside Higher Ed , doctoral theses have been devoted to the Harry Potter books. [1]  There are also several university courses centred on analysis of the Potter series, including an upper division  Political Science  course. [2] \n Time  magazine noted the political and social aspects of Harry Potter in their 2007  Person of the Year  issue where Rowling placed third behind politicians  Vladimir Putin  and  Al Gore . [3]  Harry Potter's potential social and political impact was called similar to the 19th century phenomenon of  Harriet Beecher Stowe 's popular, but critically maligned book,  Uncle Tom's Cabin , which fuelled the  abolitionist  movement leading up to the  American Civil War . [4] \n When asked about the politics and message in Harry Potter, Rowling explained, \"I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a  hierarchy , you have  bigotry , and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops up all over the world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity. [...]. It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the  Ministry  even before it's taken over, there are parallels to  regimes  we all know and love.\" [5]  She also said, \"You should question authority and you should not assume that  the establishment  or  the press  tells you all of the truth.\" [6] \n The  Wall Street Journal  compared  Neville Chamberlain  to Rowling's  Cornelius Fudge , saying both were eager to help their constituents look the other way to avoid war. \"Throughout the '30s, Chamberlain, fearing that Churchill was out for his job, conducted a campaign against his fellow Tory. Chamberlain denied the existence of the German menace and ridiculed Churchill as a 'warmonger'. He used The Times\u2014the government's house organ\u2014to attack Churchill and suppress dispatches from abroad about the Nazis that would have vindicated him.\" [7]  Rowling confirmed Chamberlain was her inspiration in the Spanish newspaper magazine  XLSemanal . [8] \n Rowling also told the Dutch newspaper  de Volkskrant  that  Voldemort  was modeled on Hitler and Stalin, as a megalomaniac and paranoid figure, and that she was influenced by the Second World War, which is \"anchored in all our minds\": discussing Draco Malfoy, she claimed \"Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy. He wouldn\u2019t have killed Dumbledore, he couldn\u2019t. As long as things are imaginary, okay, but once it becomes reality, the thing becomes more difficult.\", on the other hand, \"No, that I gave him that light blonde hair is not because I wanted to make him into a scary Nazi. You give your characters the appearance that you find attractive\".

[10] \n Bill O'Reilly  joined in the political fray over Harry Potter character  Albus Dumbledore 's outing by asking if it was part of a \"gay agenda\" to indoctrinate children. He called J. K. Rowling a  provocateur  for telling fans about Dumbledore's sexuality after the books were written. His guest,  Entertainment Weekly  Senior Editor Tina Jordan, called his \"indoctrination\" claims \"a shallow argument\", saying \"indoctrination is a very strong word\" because \"we all know gay people, whether we know it or not.\" [11]  O'Reilly continued the following day saying that the real problem is Rowling is teaching \"tolerance\" and \"parity for homosexuals with heterosexuals\". His guest  Dennis Miller  said that tolerance was good and didn't think you could indoctrinate a child into being gay. [12] \n Zenit , a news agency dedicated to promoting the message of the Catholic Church, accused Rowling of betraying her readers by disclosing Dumbledore's sexuality, and said Rowling is the wealthiest woman in Britain thanks to the lack of political, social or moral propaganda in her books. [13]  The head of  Human Life International , an American-based Roman Catholic activist pro-life organisation, taking a negative view of the books and \"their literary offspring\", said that Harry Potter indoctrinates young souls in the language and mechanics of the  occult  and said that Rowling's portrayal of Dumbledore socialises if not indoctrinates young people into tolerance of gays. [14]  The  Berkeley Beacon  said that one parent's perception of  indoctrination  is another's education, in their article,  No Politics in Harry Potter , which countered charges that Rowling promoted homosexuality in her books. [15]  Discussing the controversy, Rowling told the BBC that \"Christian fundamentalists were never my base\" and thought it ridiculous to question if a gay person could be a  moral compass  in the 21st century. [16] \n Discussing the values and morality of her characters Draco and Dudley, Rowling explained that both were indoctrinated with their parents' beliefs. \"The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,  reality finally hit him,\" Rowling said, because his dream was \"so very different\". She said that there was a real moral cowardice to Draco, but that he was not wholly bad. [17] \n Racism, mistreatment of minorities and totalitarianism [ edit ] \nThis chart for distinguishing Jews, Germans, \"mixed blood: first degree\" and \"mixed blood: second degree\", used in  Nazi Germany  is redolent of the \"pure-blood\", \"half-blood\" and \"Mudblood\"/\"Muggle-born\" divisions used in Harry Potter. \n Analysts note the criticism of racism in J. K. Rowling's texts. [18] [19] \n When asked about the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, \"I do not think I am pessimistic but I think I am realistic about how much you can change deeply entrenched prejudice, so my feeling would be that if someone were a committed racist, possibly  Harry Potter  is not going to have an effect.\" [20] \n When asked in a post- Deathly Hallows  webchat about  Hermione 's future, Rowling said, \"Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk. She then moved to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she was a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws.\" [21] \n After the publication of  Deathly Hallows , Rowling responded to queries about metaphors in the books for  ethnic cleansing : \"Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, 'I want to recreate  Nazi Germany ', in the\u2014in the wizarding world. Because\u2014although there are\u2014quite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out.\" [22]  Rowling also compared her character  Voldemort  to paranoid  megalomaniacs  like  Adolf Hitler  and  Joseph Stalin . [23] \n In her 2007 book tour Rowling further discussed the topic, stating \"It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love.\" She prefaced the remark, saying \"People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity.\" [24] \n Rowling stated on her website that the  Harry Potter  phrases 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' compared to \"some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity. [25] \n Christopher Hitchens  noted in  The New York Times  that the  lightning bolt \u2014the shape of the scar which  Harry  received as a result of  Voldemort 's curse, now considered to be  emblematic  of the series\u2014is also the symbol of Sir  Oswald Mosley 's  British Union of Fascists , a prominent group of Nazi sympathisers during the 1930s and 1940s. [26]  The Nazis themselves, in their SS,  made use of the symbol too . In the same article, [27]  Hitchens noted that \"The prejudice against bank-monopoly goblins is modeled more or less on anti-Semitism and the foul treatment of elves is meant to put us in mind of slavery\". \n J. K. Rowling mentions in an article that Mosley was married to  Diana Mitford , sister of her heroine,  Jessica Mitford . Jessica, after whom Rowling named her daughter, never forgave Diana's Nazi sympathies. [28]  Oswald and Diana married in 1936, in the Berlin home of Nazi chief  Joseph Goebbels  with Adolf Hitler as a guest. J. K. Rowling also noted that Mitford's other sister  Unity , to whom Jessica was closest in youth, became an arch-fascist and favourite of Adolf Hitler's. [28] \n Jessica's story may have thus inspired a part of Harry's story:  Narcissa Black  (analogue to Diana Mosley) married a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy (Oswald Mosley). Her sister,  Bellatrix  (Unity Mitford), was herself a Death Eater, and a favourite of Lord Voldemort (Adolf Hitler).  Andromeda  (Jessica Mitford) married the Muggle-born  Ted Tonks  against her family's wishes (as Jessica eloped with her cousin  Esmond Romilly ) and was blasted out of the  family-tree tapestry . These parallels were noted in the American communist newspaper  People's Weekly World . [19] \n In an act commemorating  the Holocaust , actor  Daniel Radcliffe , whose mother is Jewish, donated his first pair of  Harry Potter  glasses to an art exhibition inspired by a famous World War II photo of a mangled mountain of spectacles of victims of ethnic cleansing. Radcliffe's  Potter  co-star  Jason Isaacs , who played  Lucius Malfoy  in the films, himself a Jewish Briton, was due to participate in the commemorations on National  Holocaust Memorial Day , leading a service at  Liverpool 's Philharmonic Hall. [29] \n Aviva Chomsky  (daughter of famed academic  Noam Chomsky ) in the  Providence Journal  suggests that  Harry Potter  is a parable on immigration rights, noting that US \"immigration, citizenship and naturalization laws are based explicitly on discrimination on the basis of national origin. Where you were born, and what passport you carry, determine whether you have the right to come here, to visit, to work, or to live here.\" [30] \n Evils of war [ edit ] \n On the  Harry Potter  series, Rowling said on her United States book tour in October 2007, \"I very consciously wanted to show what is one of the great evils of war, which is that totally innocent people are slaughtered... Another great evil of war is that children lose their families.\" [31] \n Progressive values and diversity [ edit ] \n Time  magazine said in 2005, \"Rowling adapts an inherently conservative genre for her own  progressive  purposes. Her  Hogwarts  is  secular  and  sexual  and multicultural and  multiracial  and even sort of  multimedia , with all those talking ghosts.\" [32]  To mark the French publication of  Deathly Hallows , prominent French center-left paper  Liberation  devoted the front cover and two more pages to answering the question \"Why Harry Potter is of the Left\". [33] \n In 2007, responding to a question from a child about  Dumbledore 's love life, Rowling revealed, \"I always saw Dumbledore as gay.\" Filling in a few more details, she said, \"Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald.... Don't forget, falling in love can blind us. [He] was very drawn to this brilliant person. This was Dumbledore's tragedy.\" [34] \n Melissa Anelli, webmaster of the fan site  The Leaky Cauldron , told The Associated Press, \"Jo Rowling calling any Harry Potter character gay would make wonderful strides in tolerance toward homosexuality.... By dubbing someone so respected, so talented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, she's reinforcing the idea that a person's gayness is not something of which they should be ashamed.\" [35]  Of the ensuing controversy, Rowling said, \"I know that it was a positive thing that I said it, for at least one person, because one man 'came out' at Carnegie Hall.\" [36]   Entertainment Weekly' s  Mark Harris  said \"her choice to make a beloved professor-mentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as malign influences was, I am certain, no accident.\" Harris also says that there is a drastic underrepresentation of gays in the population, and it is a failure of decency and nerve on the entertainment industry\u2014 \"including the tremendous number of gay producers, writers, and executives who sacrifice their convictions so they don't look too  strident  or  political. \" [37] \n According to  Think Progress , a  progressive  news site, conservative blogs say [ clarification needed ]  Rowling's revelation about Dumbledore vindicates  Jerry Falwell 's attacks on homosexuality in children's media that were lambasted by the mass media. [38]  \"What's stopping her from saying that [Harry's friend] Neville grows up to be a  paedophile ?\" said David Baggett, an associate philosophy professor at Falwell's  Liberty University 's School of Religion. Baggett, who coauthored the book  Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts , says he was taken aback not only by Rowling's announcement, but by the fact that it came on the heels of her confirming many Potter fans' belief that the series had Christian themes. [39] \n Slate Magazine  quotes an attendee of the book talk who said, \"It was clear that JKR didn't plan to out Dumbledore. She just cares about being true to her readers.\" [40]  Mike Thomas of the  Orlando Sentinel  said that upon reflection, Dumbledore was gay from the beginning, and that this neatly explains the behaviour of his character and his relationship with Grindelwald. Thomas notes the skill Rowling displays in writing a gay character without having to put a gay label on him. [41] \n According to Reuters, Rowling was surprised over the fuss and declined to say whether her \"outing\" of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality. \"It has certainly never been news to me that a brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is and I have the right to say what I say about him,\" she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as  The Leaky Cauldron  and  MuggleNet . [42] \n Actor  David Thewlis  ( Remus Lupin ) said that he was surprised about Dumbledore's sexuality, because while he was filming  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  director  Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n  had the idea that \"Lupin was gay, and he described my character like a 'gay junkie'.\" [43] \n Catholic fantasy author Regina Doman wrote an essay titled \"In Defense of Dumbledore\", in which she argued that the books actually support Catholic teaching on homosexuality because Dumbledore's relationship with the dark wizard Grindelwald leads to obviously terrible results, as he becomes interested in dark magic himself, neglects his responsibilities towards his younger sister and ultimately causes her death. [44] \n The South Florida  Sun-Sentinel ' s book reviewer Chauncey Mabe says that it was wrong for Rowling to disclose Dumbledore's  sexual orientation . Mabe was clear that this was not due to Dumbledore's being gay, but to his own objections to authors continuing to talk about their books after they are written. He called for Rowling to \"please be quiet, please\" in \"public gatherings\", which is contrary to the massive popularity of Rowling's book talks and her fans' thirst for more information about characters in the Harry Potter books. Mabe notes that 1,000 children attended the \"reading\" before they were given autographed books. Robin Berkowitz,  Sun-Sentinel  Entertainment Editor says of Rowling's comments, and other revelations she might make about her characters \"We don't need to know any of them to appreciate the books fully,\" \"Don't ask, don't spell\" a reference to the U.S. military's former policy on homosexuality,  Don't ask, don't tell . [45]  These sentiments are mirrored by Jeffrey Weiss in his article, \"Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up\", published in the  Dallas Morning News . [46] \n The  Washington Post ' s Michael Gerson says \"tolerance is one of the main themes of the Harry Potter books. In a marvelous social comparison,  lycanthropy  is treated as a kind of chronic disease, with  werewolves  subject to discrimination as if they had AIDS.\" [47] \n Social activism [ edit ] \n According to  Philip Nel  of  Kansas State University , the Potter series can be seen as \"political novels that critique racism and racial superiority. Rowling, who worked for  Amnesty International , evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her \"Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.\" [48]   Dobby the house elf  has been compared to the labour lawyer  Dobby Walker  who introduced Rowling's heroine, Jessica Mitford, to the  Communist Party . [49]  Hermione is depicted as starting a campaign to emancipate the enslaved  House elves , using the methods of real-world campaigns on social and political issues such as badges with slogans. She persists in this campaigning also when it is considered quixotic even by her close friends and not much appreciated even by most of the House elves themselves. But in  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , the campaign turns out to have had enormous unforeseen results, with House elves joining the struggle and making several indispensable contributions to Voldemort's final defeat and saving the main protagonists' lives. Rowling said in an early interview that Hermione and her political conscience about the rights of elves was fairly autobiographical. [50] \n Neoconservatism [ edit ] \n It has been argued that in many ways the Harry Potter series appears to have a  neoconservative  message, particularly during and after Order of the Phoenix, which happened to be the first Harry Potter book published after  9/11 , when neoconservatism was at its strongest political position. Specifically, the struggle between Harry and Voldemort is framed in a  Manichaean  spirit of good confronting evil, and in particular of freedom versus tyranny, a theme that has been commonly identified with neoconservative ideology in many works. Furthermore, the heroes of the story accuse Cornelius Fudge of deliberately obfuscating the threat of Voldemort, reminiscent of when many neoconservatives accused President Obama and other Democrats with the charge that they did not call out  ISIS  as pertaining to  radical Islam , or downplaying the nature of the Islamist threat. Similarly, they were against appeasement, and wanted to confront Voldemort directly, such as by setting up the Order of the Phoenix and Harry training Dumbledore's Army to defend against Voldemort and his Death Eater. Many neocons have warned of \"the lessons of Munich\", and Neville Chamberlain's appeasement, particularly when it came to states such as  Soviet Union  and the  Islamic Republic of Iran . \n Subversive and anarchistic message [ edit ] \n Gerson of the  Washington Post  also described what he considered to be the very  subversive  nature of the Harry Potter books in the answer they offer to death. Voldemort believes that death must be mastered and \"beaten\". In contrast, Harry accepts the necessity of his own death for the sake of love. Gerson also suggests that some will ask the book series about tolerance also be a book series about religion. He answers that many others \"believe \u2013 not in spite of their faith but because of it \u2013 that half-bloods, werewolves and others should be treated with kindness and fairness. Above all, believers are called to love, even at the highest cost.\" [47] \n In a 1999 interview with Rowling,  The Guardian  Unlimited' s Joanna Carey said, \"JK Rowling is every bit as witty and subversive as you'd expect. Rowling described her admiration of Jessica Mitford since age 14, her time at  Exeter University  \"not quite the chance to be the 'radical' I planned\", and said the later books dealing with Harry's hormones, and deaths would be unlike other children's series like the  Famous Five . Carey suggested a parallel between Harry Potter and  Prince Harry  which Rowling laughs off saying a friend said never let the press make you discuss the  royal family . [51] \n James Morone, a political science professor at  Brown University , wrote in the liberal  American Prospect  in 2001, \"Magical headmaster Albus Dumbledore practically awards bonus points for breaking rules. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is unruly, even slightly anarchic. Harry's classmate Hermione 'had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules,' writes Rowling near the end of Philosopher's Stone, 'and she was much nicer for it.' There's more than a touch of anarchy when all the students sing to their own tune. In her books, the kids are the central agents of their own lives. They make choices. Weigh judgments. Wrestle with freedom.\" [52] \n Isabelle Smadja of  Le Monde  wrote that Harry Potter is the first fictional hero of the anti- globalist , anti-capitalist, pro- Third World , \" Seattle \" generation. She wrote that \"Examination of the text suggests that they are, in fact, a ferocious critique of  consumer society  and the world of  free enterprise .\" [53] \n Conservative objections to liberal and socialist values [ edit ] \n The right-wing U.S.  John Birch Society  has objected to Rowling's books and her public statements. In his article for the John Birch Society's magazine  The New American ,  Constitution Party  Communications Director Steve Bonta compared  Harry Potter  negatively to  The Lord of the Rings , saying, \"The Potter books read in places like diatribes against the modern middle class, especially whenever Harry confronts his ludicrously dysfunctional and downright abusive adopted family,  the Dursleys .\" [54] \n Accusations of conservative and sexist themes [ edit ] \n The critic  Anthony Holden  wrote in  The Observer  on his experience of judging  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  for the  1999 Whitbread Awards . His overall view of the series was very negative\u2014\"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, very conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly  nostalgic  for a bygone Britain.\" [55]  A review in  The Guardian  echoed this interpretation and stated that \"despite all of the books' gestures to multiculturalism and gender equality, Harry Potter is a conservative; a paternalistic, One-Nation  Tory , perhaps, but a Tory nonetheless.\" [56]   Salon.com  critic Christine Schoefer has also criticised the books as  sexist , claiming that the series presents a  patriarchal  world filled with stereotypes and adherence to \"the conventional assumption that men do and should run the world\". [57] \n When an interviewer suggested her books portrayed a conservative world, Rowling replied, \"So I'm told repeatedly. The two groups of people who are constantly thanking me are  Wiccans  and  boarding schools . And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them.  New ageism  leaves me completely cold, and [my daughter] would never go to boarding school. I went to a  comprehensive .\" [58] \n Rowling says she gets frustrated with the \"conservative world thing\". She made Hogwarts a boarding school so that action could happen in the middle of the night and to create a sense of community among the characters. Harry also reflects the modern world, she argues, in that he is  mixed race  \u2014  his father  being  pure-blood ,  his mother  being  Muggle-born .\" [58]  She also says her feminist conscience is saved by  Hermione , \"who's the brightest character\" and is a \"very strong female character\". [59] \n Neoliberal and capitalist values [ edit ] \n In an article published in prominent French newspaper  Le Monde , literary scholar Ilias Yocaris argued that  Harry Potter  \"probably unintentionally ... appears as a summary of the social and educational aims of  neoliberal  capitalism.\" According to Yocaris' analysis, all life at  Hogwarts  is dominated by a culture of competition: \"competition among students to be prefect; competition among  Hogwarts houses  to gain points; competition among sorcery schools to win the Triwizard tournament; and, ultimately, the bloody competition between the forces of Good and Evil.\" The  free market  plays a prominent and positive role, while the state (the  Ministry of Magic ) is presented as inefficient and bureaucratic. In this \"pitiless jungle\", education only aims to \"give students an immediately exploitable practical knowledge that can help them in their battle to survive,\" while artistic subjects and social sciences are useless or absent. Yocaris concludes that \"like  Orwellian   totalitarianism , this capitalism tries to fashion not only the real world, but also the imagination of consumer-citizens,\" producing literature that suggests that no alternative is possible. [60]  In an article published in  Journal of Contemporary Religion , Michael Ostling also argued that the series depicts a modern capitalist and  consumerist  society, where the role of  gadgetry  is played by magic. [61]  The article by Yocaris provoked the response by Isabelle Smadja cited previously. \n Class distinctions [ edit ] \n O: The Oprah Magazine  noted that Rowling admires  Roddy Doyle  and  Jane Austen , saying \"both of whom write about class distinctions,\" and asked if the reason Rowling wrote about class was a conscious decision. Rowling replied, \"kids are acutely aware of money\u2014before they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how another kid holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I think back to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And not being able to buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches. Having enough money to fit in is an important facet of life\u2014and what is more conformist than a school?\" [59] \n Anti-government interpretation [ edit ] \n Some political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the  bureaucratised  Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the \"registration of  Mudbloods \" with the Ministry) as an allegory  criticising the state . [62] \n The  People's Weekly World , the newspaper of the  Communist Party USA , claims the books draw you \"into the politics of the wizarding world\u2014the 'Educational Decrees' from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of 'war criminals' from the last rise of Voldemort, the predjudice [ sic ] against 'mudbloods' and 'half-breeds.'\" They suggest connections \"to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the  Fudge administration  and the  Bush administration \". [63] \n Philosopher Jean-Claude Milner claimed \"Harry Potter is a war machine against the  Thatcherite - Blairist  world and the 'American Way of Life'\" in France's  Lib\u00e9ration . [33] \n University of Tennessee  law professor Benjamin Barton discusses  libertarian  aspects of  Harry Potter  in his paper  Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy , published in the  Michigan Law Review . Barton says, \"Rowling's scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often to the detriment of the public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a  public-interest  scholar's dream\u2014or nightmare\u2014government.\" [64] \n Rowling describes the beloved wizard Dumbledore as  Machiavellian  and says \"I wanted you to question Dumbledore. It is right to question him, because he was treating people like puppets, and he was asking Harry to do a job that most men twice his age wouldn't have been able to do.\" [17] \n Characters compared to George Bush, Tony Blair, and Saddam Hussein [ edit ] \n Newsweek  magazine asked  Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n , director of the third film based on Rowling's  Prisoner of Azkaban  if the villainous wizard Voldemort still reminded him of  George W. Bush . Cuar\u00f3n confirmed, \"In combination with  Saddam . They both have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people. I read books four and five, and Fudge is similar to Tony Blair. He's the ultimate politician. He's in denial about many things. And everything is for the sake of his own persona, his own power. The way the Iraq thing was handled was not unlike the way Fudge handled affairs in book four.\" [65] \n Slate Magazine  also says Rowling takes jabs at the Bush and Blair administrations suggesting the Ministry of Magic's security pamphlet recalls the much-scorned  Operation TIPS  (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). The author also suggests that  Azkaban , the wizard penitentiary, is a stand-in for  Guantanamo Bay . [66] \n Rowling has never confirmed these interpretations in  Harry Potter ; however, when the then  Chancellor   Gordon Brown  once asked her to endorse the Labour Party while Tony Blair was Prime Minister, Rowling refused. [67]  Rowling attacked the Blair government's policy on single parent families. She said that  Labour  could do \"a good deal more\" and then donated \u00a3500,000 to the One Parent Families charity to set an example. [67]  Rowling said that Brown's measures for children 'would have made a real difference to my family's life' when she was poor. [68]  Blair stepped down shortly before the release of Rowling's seventh book, and Brown was appointed Prime Minister. Rowling subsequently donated \u00a31 million to the Labour Party during the 2010 general election which Labour lost. [69] \n Education reform in  The Order of the Phoenix [ edit ] \n Teachers have hailed  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  as a \"blistering satire on years of politically motivated interference in the running of schools\". [70] \n Rowling describes her character  Dolores Umbridge , the Ministry-appointed headmistress of Hogwarts and under-secretary to the minister, Cornelius Fudge, saying \"She has good contacts at the Ministry. She is one of those people, and they do exist in real life, who will always side with the established order. As far as she is concerned authority cannot be wrong so she doesn't question it, and I would go as far as to say that whatever happened and whoever took over at the Ministry, Umbridge would be there, she likes power. So she is going to side with the people who give her the authority.\" [20] \n Andrew Slack, founder of the  Harry Potter Alliance , says in  In These Times , \"Harry Potter supersedes news about genocide, men assess their 'worth' by their paychecks, women's bodies are treated as commodities and our educational system preoccupies itself not with stimulating children's curiosity but rather getting them to efficiently regurgitate information on standardised tests.\" [71] \n Hungarian Secretary of State for Education  R\u00f3zsa Hoffmann  and her reforms have often been compared to Dolores Umbridge and her actions in the novels. [72] [73] [74] \n Anti-terrorism [ edit ] \n The Capitalism Magazine website says that, \"With a long-term war in progress and threats of further terrorist attacks on American soil,\"  Harry Potter  isn't mere escapism and \"shows a world in which happiness can be achieved, villains can be defeated, and the means of success can be learned.\" [75] \n Time  magazine says that by  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , \"Harry is embroiled in a borderless, semi-civil war with a shadowy, hidden leader whose existence the government ignored until disaster forced the issue and who is supported by a secret network of sleeper agents willing to resort to tactics of shocking cruelty. The kids who grew up on Harry Potter\u2014you could call them  Generation Hex \u2014are the kids who grew up with the pervasive threat of terrorism, and it's inevitable that on some level they'll make a connection between the two.\" [32] \n Slate Magazine' s Julia Turner compares  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  to the  War on Terror  in the context of the fight against  Osama bin Laden  saying Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying  Fred  and  George Weasley 's shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new  Minister of Magic  jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and create the impression that he's taking action. [66] \n Rowling said \"I've never thought, 'It's time for a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are parallels, obviously. I think one of the times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of  Stan Shunpike , you know? I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it.\" [76] \n Academic  Steven Fielding  argues in  A State of Play: British Politics on Screen, Stage and Page, from Anthony Trollope to The Thick of It  that the changing portray of the Ministry of Magic - from incompetent to authoritarian - reflects Rowling's views on the  War on Terror . [77] \n Harry Potter used by political activists [ edit ] \n KidSPEAK! [ edit ] \n In response to restricted access to the  Harry Potter  books [78]  children began a letter-writing campaign, forming clubs and organising petitions, which ultimately merged into an internet site called Muggles for Harry Potter. The site evolved into kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle censorship in general, and to fight for Harry Potter specifically. \n The Harry Potter Alliance [ edit ] \n Main article:  Harry Potter Alliance \n Andrew Slack, an actor/comedian and Harry Potter aficionado, co-founded the  Harry Potter Alliance  to highlight the crisis in  Sudan  and social inequities. [79]   In These Times  featured Slack in 2007, in an article about  Muggle  Activists where Slack said, \"The Harry Potter parallel to  Darfur  is simple: With both the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet (the Wizarding World's mainstream news source) in denial that Voldemort has returned and evil is afoot, Harry and his underground rebel group, ' Dumbledore's Army ,' work with the adult group, ' The Order of the Phoenix ,' to awake the world. We in the Alliance seek to be Dumbledore's Army for the real world, working with anti-genocide organisations, such as 'Fidelity Out of Sudan' and the ' Genocide Intervention Network ,' to wake our governments, corporations and media up to the fact that 'never again' means 'never again.'\" [80] \n When  Time  magazine asked about  The Harry Potter Alliance , Rowling said, \"It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause.\" [81]  Rowling awarded  The Harry Potter Alliance  a Fan Site Award in December 2007. \n In February 2010, the HPA ran a massive fundraiser to support those in dire need after the tragic event of the  Haiti earthquake . Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those a part of the Harry Potter Fandom) performed and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor  Tom Felton , handmade earrings from actress  Evanna Lynch , and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by  Maureen Johnson  and  John Green . The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans.  Ophelia Dahl , the daughter of the late British author  Roald Dahl  was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal. [82] \n In March 2010,  The Harry Potter Alliance  had a campaign for people to send in their books to the Mississippi Delta which went to  Rwanda . As of June, when the campaign ended, they donated over 40,000 books. In July 2010, The Harry Potter Alliance won $250,000 in the  Chase Community Giving  contest. The money will go towards literacy, LGBT rights, and online community building. \n Wal-Mart Watch [ edit ] \n Main article:  Walmart Watch \n Wal-Mart Watch uses parodies of Harry Potter to compare  WalMart  to Lord Voldemort and draws analogies between House elves and forced labour. [83] \n Stop Big Media [ edit ] \n Stop Big Media gained support from \"Rocking Out Against Voldemedia\", a compilation of ten original songs by ten Harry Potter-themed \"Wizard Rock\" bands. Andrew Slack and  The Harry Potter Alliance  compare  media consolidation  in the U.S. to the control of the Ministry of Magic over the  Daily Prophet  in the Harry Potter books saying \"Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the Wizarding World, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called \"Potterwatch. Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press.\" [84] \n Center for Science in the Public Interest [ edit ] \n Main article:  Center for Science in the Public Interest \n A worldwide campaign to \"save Harry Potter from the clutches of the Coca-Cola Company\" was launched by the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. The group says that by aggressively marketing sugar- and caffeine-laden drinks to young fans of the Harry Potter series, Coke is helping fuel the  childhood obesity  epidemic. [85] \n Campaign for America's Future [ edit ] \n Main article:  Campaign for America's Future \n In a parody of  Harry Potter ,  Campaign for America's Future  cast Seinfeld alumnus,  Jason Alexander  as \"Lord Rovemort\", a  Karl Rove  figure that coordinates Republican \"obstruction\" in Congress. [86] \n Politics of J. K. Rowling [ edit ] \n Rowling is a noted philanthropist and maintains links on her website promoting  Amnesty International , the  Multiple sclerosis  Society,  One Parent Families , and  Lumos  (formerly the Children's High Level Group), which Rowling co-founded to advocate against the use of  cage beds  for mentally handicapped children. Rowling says her heroine is  muckraker   Jessica Mitford , whom Rowling describes as a \"self-taught socialist\". [87]  Rowling acknowledges being left-wing and said \"there is a certain amount of political stuff in [Harry Potter]. But I also feel that every reader will bring his own agenda to the book. People who send their children to boarding schools seem to feel that I'm on their side. I'm not. Practicing wiccans think I'm also a witch. I'm not.\" [88] \n UK politics [ edit ] \n J. K. Rowling has been a long-time friend of former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  and his wife  Sarah Brown . In September 2008, Rowling donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the  Labour Party , saying: \n I believe that poor and vulnerable families will fare much better under the Labour Party than they would under a  Cameron -led  Conservative Party . Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in  child poverty , and is one of the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times. [89] \n Rowling praised Brown in a 2009  Time  magazine essay saying she \"still wanted him in charge\". [90] \n Rowling wrote about what it meant to be British saying, \"It means a welfare state of which we should be fiercely proud and a tradition of tolerance and free speech we should defend to our last collective breath.\" Rowling also praised the  National Health Service  (NHS). [91] \n U.S. politics [ edit ] \n Rowling told a Spanish newspaper in February 2008 that \"the international political stance of the United States has been wrong in previous years, for its own and for my country... I want a Democrat in the White House. It's sad  Obama  and  Clinton  are rivals because they are both great.\" [92]  In 2009, Obama returned the compliment when he met Rowling at a  G20  dinner telling her that he had read all her books himself and to his children Sasha and Malia. [93] \n Rowling advised the 2008 graduating class of Harvard, \"the great majority of you belong to the world's only remaining superpower. The way you vote, the way you live, the way you protest, the pressure you bring to bear on your government, has an impact way beyond your borders. That is your privilege, and your burden.\" [94] \n The  Presidential Medal of Freedom  was allegedly refused to be awarded to Rowling under  George W. Bush , because her writing \"encouraged witchcraft\". This was claimed by  Matt Latimer , a former speechwriter for Bush, who went on to write a memoir about his time in the administration, [95]  although then First Lady  Laura Bush  had declared a fondness for the books. [96] \n Rowling made analogies between  Donald Trump  and Voldemort after the Republican presidential candidate called for a ban on  Muslims  entering the United States on 7 December 2015. [97]  In January 2017 she rebutted with \" lonely   virgin \" in response to criticism from a Trump supporter. [98] \n Amnesty International [ edit ] \n Her employment at Amnesty International made Rowling realise that \"imagination is what allows us to empathise with people who have suffered horribly and to act on their behalf.\" The danger of inaction, Rowling said, comes from people who \"prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages. They can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know. \n \"I might be tempted to envy people who can live that way, except that I do not think they have any fewer nightmares than I do. Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the wilfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid.\" [94] \n Green values [ edit ] \n J. K. Rowling was recognised with the Order of the Forest for demanding that 16 publishers around the world print her books using \"eco-friendly\" papers. The last book in the Potter series is considered within the industry to be the most environmentally friendly in publishing history. [99] \n In 2008, J. K. Rowling blocked the Finnish publication of her latest Harry Potter novel on paper from  Finland  because it lacked the ecologically friendly certification she favours. [100] \n Eating disorders [ edit ] \n Rowling used her celebrity status on her personal website to advocate her views on skinny, celebrity role models. Rowling said these young women's \"only function in the world appears to be supporting the trade in overpriced handbags and rat-sized dogs.\" [101] \n Simon Walters, political editor of the  Mail on Sunday , complained that Rowling's attack on weight standards was hypocritical because so many evil characters in her books, such as Dudley and Vernon Dursley, are fat, while Harry Potter himself is so skinny. [102]  Rowling responded to her critics by saying that the people in the Harry Potter books who are \"on the plumper side\" include \"several of my most important, admirable and loveable characters\". She included a link to a fan website \u2013 www.mugglenet.com \u2013 that lists seven characters who are \"fat and good\", three who are \"fat and bad\" and claims there are none who are \"fat and evil\". However, there were skinny and evil characters in the series. [103] \n Age branding of children's books [ edit ] \n J. K. Rowling opposes the labelling of children's books as \"age appropriate\". [104] \n Scottish independence campaign [ edit ] \n As a resident of Scotland, Rowling was eligible to vote in the 2014  referendum on Scottish independence , and intended to vote \"No\". [105]  She donated \u00a31 million (US$1,694,000) to the  Better Together  anti-independence campaign, [106]  led by former neighbour and friend Darling, and used the \"Death Eaters\" characters from her Harry Potter series\u2014who reject magicians unless they have pure blood\u2014as a reference in her blog-post explanation of her donation; Rowling's words are: \"However, when people try to make this debate about the purity of your lineage, things start getting a little Death Eaterish for my taste.\" [107]  In Rowling's post-donation blog post in mid-June 2014, she explained that she is \"friendly\" with members of both campaigns and stated a belief that \"there are intelligent, thoughtful people on both sides of this question\". [108] \n While Rowling concluded that \"If the majority of people in Scotland want independence I truly hope that it is a resounding success\" and that her \"love\" for Scotland is why she wants it to \"thrive, she explains in the body of her piece that she is concerned about \"serious risks\", with Scottish medical research of particular interest to her\u2014Rowling has donated a large sum of money to  Multiple Sclerosis  research after her mother's death from the disease. Rowling's fear was triggered by an open letter co-signed by all five of Scotland's medical schools, in which \"grave concerns\" are expressed about the impact of independence upon Scotland's highly regarded medical work. The letter, which says that First Minister  Alex Salmond \u2019s plans for a common research funding area are \"fraught with difficulty\" and \"unlikely to come to fruition\", is supported by 14 professors, who all agree that \"it is highly unlikely that the remaining UK would tolerate a situation in which an independent 'competitor' country won more money than it contributed.\" [108] \n The  Edinburgh -based National Collective organisation of artists and writers who support independence\u2014\"non-party movement for artists and creatives who support Scottish independence\"\u2014published an open letter in response to Rowling's explanation on 11 June 2014, signed by Teaching Research Assistant and  freelancer  Mairi McFadyen. [109]  McFadyen states that she is \"saddened\" by Rowling's position, but asserts that \"It is not my intention here to rebut your arguments, but rather to offer a response.\" McFadyen writes that the referendum is \"the most wonderful gift\", as citizens of their own country are asked for their opinion about their nation's future, and the \"referendum question has sparked the imagination of the nation\". McFadyen concludes with several quotes taken from a speech delivered by Rowling, as well as a poem from Maurice Lindsay, and concludes: \"We would be delighted to extend an invitation to yourself to attend one of the many Yestival events taking place across Scotland this July.\" [110] \n Position on Israel [ edit ] \n On October 22, 2015, a letter was published in  The Guardian  signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of  Israel , and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence. [111]  Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of  Benjamin Netanyahu 's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine. [112] \n European migrant crisis [ edit ] \n In 2015 Rowling expressed support for the refugees. [113] [114]  By 2017 a petition asking her to shelter immigrants on her property acquired over 50,000 signatures. [115] \n References [ edit ] \n Library of Congress: Rowling, J. K.
