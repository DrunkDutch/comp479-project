K. Rowling . The series is distributed by  Warner Bros.  and consists of eight  fantasy films , beginning with  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  (2001) and culminating with  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2  (2011). [2] [3]  A  spin-off   prequel  series will consist of five films, starting with  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  (2016). The  Fantastic Beasts  films mark the beginning of a shared media franchise known as  J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World . [4] \n The series was mainly produced by  David Heyman , and stars  Daniel Radcliffe ,  Rupert Grint , and  Emma Watson  as the three leading characters:  Harry Potter ,  Ron Weasley , and  Hermione Granger . Four directors worked on the series:  Chris Columbus ,  Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n ,  Mike Newell , and  David Yates . [5]  The screenplays were written by  Steve Kloves , with the exception of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  (2007), which was written by  Michael Goldenberg . Production took over ten years to complete, with the main  story arc  following Harry Potter's quest to overcome his arch-enemy  Lord Voldemort . [6] \n Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts. [7]   Part 1  was released in November 2010, and  Part 2  was released in July 2011. [8] [9] \n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (2004) is the only film in the series not among the  50 highest-grossing films of all time , with  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 , the highest-grossing film in the series and one of 30 films to gross over $1 billion, ranking at number eight. [10]  Without inflation adjustment, it is  the second highest-grossing film series  with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts. \n Contents \n 1   Origins \n 1.1   Casting the roles of Harry, Ron, and Hermione \n 2   Production \n 2.1   Directors \n 2.2   Scripts \n 2.3   Cast and crew \n 2.4   Set design \n 2.5   Cinematography \n 2.6   Editing \n 2.7   Music \n 2.8   Visual effects \n 2.9   Final filming \n 3   Films \n 3.1   Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  (2001) \n 3.2   Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  (2002) \n 3.3   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (2004) \n 3.4   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  (2005) \n 3.5   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  (2007) \n 3.6   Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  (2009) \n 3.7   Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1  (2010) \n 3.8   Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2  (2011) \n 4   Release \n 5   Reception \n 5.1   Critical response \n 5.1.1   Critical and public response \n 5.2   Accolades \n 5.3   Box office performance \n 5.4   All-time rankings \n 6   Legacy and influence \n 7   Notes \n 8   References \n 9   External links \n Origins \n Late in 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven  Harry Potter  novels. The book,  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the rubbish title\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time. [11] \n Heyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four  Harry Potter  books to Warner Bros. for a reported  \u00a3 1 million (US$2,000,000). [12]  A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as  Richard Harris  as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  where characters from the book are specified as such. [13]  Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels. [14] \n Although  Steven Spielberg  initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer. [15]  Spielberg wanted the adaptation to be an  animated film , with American actor  Haley Joel Osment  providing Harry Potter's voice. [16]  Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would have been like \"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge\". [17]  In the \"Rubbish\" Bin section of her website, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him [Spielberg] needs their  Quick-Quotes Quill  serviced.\" [18] \n After Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including  Chris Columbus ,  Jonathan Demme ,  Terry Gilliam ,  Mike Newell ,  Alan Parker ,  Wolfgang Petersen ,  Rob Reiner ,  Tim Robbins ,  Brad Silberling , and  Peter Weir . [19]  Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000. [20]  It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling. [21]  Rowling's first choice was Terry Gilliam. [22]  However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as  Home Alone  and  Mrs. Doubtfire  as influences for their decision. [23] \n Harry Potter  is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus]. \n \u2014\u2009 Lorenzo di Bonaventura ,  Warner Bros. [23] \n Steve Kloves  was selected to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \"tough\" since it did not \"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\". Kloves was sent a \"raft\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with  Harry Potter  being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters. [24]  David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film. [23]  Rowling received a large amount of creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind. [25] \n Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001. [26] \n Casting the roles of Harry, Ron, and Hermione \n Daniel Radcliffe ,  Emma Watson , and  Rupert Grint  at the world premiere of  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2  in  Trafalgar Square ,  London  on 7 July 2011. \n In 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor  Daniel Radcliffe  was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman's own words, \"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\" [11] \n Radcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999  BBC  television production of  David Copperfield  in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents to allow him to audition for the part of  Harry Potter , which involved Radcliffe being filmed. [11]  (This  screen test  footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.) [27]  Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't think there was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter. [11] [28] \n Also in 2000, the then unknown British actors  Emma Watson  and  Rupert Grint  were selected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of  Hermione Granger  and  Ron Weasley , respectively. Their only previous acting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson ten at the time they were cast. [29] \n Los Angeles Times  writer Geoff Boucher, who conducted the above-mentioned interview with Heyman, added that the casting of the three major roles \"is especially impressive in hindsight. The trio's selection was arguably one of the best show-business decisions over the past decade... they have shown admirable grace and steadiness in the face of teen superstardom.\" [11] [28] \n Production \n Filming of the series began at  Leavesden Studios , Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011. [6]  Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming  Harry Potter , and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden).

Studios, Leavesden , where much of the film series was shot.  Harry Potter  was also filmed in other areas, including  Pinewood Studios . \n David Heyman produced all the films in the series with his production company  Heyday Films , while David Barron joined the series as an executive producer on  Chamber of Secrets  and  Goblet of Fire . Barron was later appointed producer on the last four films. Chris Columbus was an executive producer on the first two films alongside Mark Radcliffe and  Michael Barnathan , but he became a producer on the third film alongside Heyman and Radcliffe. Other executive producers include  Tanya Seghatchian  and  Lionel Wigram . J. K. Rowling, author of the series, was asked to become a producer on  Goblet of Fire  but declined. She subsequently accepted the role on the two-part  Deathly Hallows . [31] \n Heyday Films and Columbus' company  1492 Pictures  collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle Productions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though  Prisoner of Azkaban  was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued with the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The sixth film in the series,  Half-Blood Prince , was the most expensive film to produce as of 2009 [update] . \n Warner Bros.  split the seventh and final novel in the series,  Deathly Hallows , into two cinematic parts. The two parts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the completion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end of filming  Harry Potter . Heyman stated that  Deathly Hallows  was \" shot as one film \" but released in two feature-length parts. [32] \n Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production on  Harry Potter , \"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\" David Heyman said, \"When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\" Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman \"made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it.\" After the film's success, Heyman was given \"more freedom\". [33] \n One of the aims of the filmmakers from the beginning of production was to develop the maturity of the films. Chris Columbus stated, \"We realised that these movies would get progressively darker. Again, we didn't know  how  dark but we realised that as the kids get older, the movies get a little edgier and darker.\" [34]  This transpired with the succeeding three directors who would work on the series in the following years, with the films beginning to deal with issues such as death, betrayal, prejudice, and political corruption as the series developed narratively and thematically. [5] [35] \n Directors \n After  Chris Columbus  had finished working on  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , he was hired to direct the second film,  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets . The production started within a week after the release of the first film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series, [36]  but he did not want to return for the third film,  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , claiming he was \"burned out\". [37]  He moved to the position of producer, while  Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n  was approached for the role of director. He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story. [38] \n David Yates  directed four of the films in the series, including the two-part finale  Deathly Hallows . \n Because Cuar\u00f3n decided not to direct the fourth instalment,  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , a new director had to be selected. [39]   Mike Newell  was chosen to direct the film, but he declined to direct the next film,  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , which was given to  David Yates , who also directed  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  and  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , becoming the only director to helm more than one film since Chris Columbus. \n Chris Columbus said his vision of the first two films was of a \"golden storybook, an old-fashioned look\", while Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n changed the visual tone of the series, desaturated the colour palette, and expanded the landscape around  Hogwarts . [34] [39]  Mike Newell decided to direct the fourth film as a \"paranoid thriller\", while David Yates wanted to \"bring a sense of jeopardy and character to the world\". [40] [41]  Cuar\u00f3n, Newell, and Yates have said that their challenge was striking a balance between making the films according to their individual vision, while working within a cinematic world already established by Columbus. [39] [40] [41] \n David Heyman commented on the \"generosity of the directors\" by revealing that \"Chris spent time with Alfonso, Alfonso spent time with Mike and Mike spent time with David, showing him an early cut of the film, talking through what it means to be a director and how they went about [making the films].\" [42] \n David Heyman also said, \"I suppose Chris Columbus was the most conservative choice from the studio's point of view. But he expressed real passion.\" [33]  Producer Tanya Seghatchian said they were \"more adventurous\" in choosing a director for the third film and went straight to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. [33]  Mike Newell became the first British director of the series when he was chosen for the fourth film; Newell was considered to direct the first film before he dropped out. [33]  David Yates directed the final films after David Heyman thought him capable of handling the edgy, emotional, and political material of the later novels. [43] \n All the directors have been supportive of each other. Chris Columbus praised the character development in the films, while Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n admired the \"quiet poetry\" of David Yates' films. [34] [39]  Mike Newell noted that each director had a different heroism, and David Yates views the first four films \"respectfully and enjoy[s] them.\" [40] [41]  Daniel Radcliffe said Yates \"took the charm of the films that Chris made and the visual flair of everything that Alfonso did and the thoroughly British, bombastic nature of the film directed by Mike Newell\" and added \"his own sense\" of  realism . [44] \n Scripts \n Steve Kloves  wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by  Michael Goldenberg . Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \"tremendous elbow room\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves. [45] \nA studio model of  Hogwarts . It is the main setting in the series; the castle features in every novel and screen adaptation. \n In a 2010 interview, David Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film transition. He commented on Rowling's involvement in the series, stating that she understood that \"books and films are different\" and was \"the best support\" a producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were viewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that Kloves was the \"key voice\" in the process of adapting the novels and that certain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts due to the filmmakers' decision to keep the main focus on Harry's journey as a character, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman mentioned that some fans \"don't necessarily understand the adaptation process\" and that the filmmakers would have loved to \"have everything\" from the books in the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \"neither time nor cinematic structure\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel to the screen is \"a really considered process.\" [46] \n Because the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'\" [47]  Kloves also said, \"I don't know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\" [47] \n Cast and crew \n See also:  List of Harry Potter cast members \n Aside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include  Robbie Coltrane  as  Rubeus Hagrid ,  Tom Felton  as  Draco Malfoy ,  Alan Rickman  as  Severus Snape , and  Dame Maggie Smith  as  Minerva McGonagall .  Richard Harris , who played the role of Professor  Albus Dumbledore , died on 25 October 2002 causing the role to be re-cast for the third instalment,  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . David Heyman and director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n chose  Michael Gambon  to portray the character of Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include  Helena Bonham Carter  as  Bellatrix Lestrange ,  Warwick Davis  as  Filius Flitwick ,  Ralph Fiennes  as  Lord Voldemort ,  Brendan Gleeson  as  Alastor Moody ,  Richard Griffiths  as  Vernon Dursley ,  Jason Isaacs  as  Lucius Malfoy ,  Gary Oldman  as  Sirius Black ,  Fiona Shaw  as  Petunia Dursley ,  Timothy Spall  as  Peter Pettigrew ,  David Thewlis  as  Remus Lupin ,  Emma Thompson  as  Sybill Trelawney ,  Mark Williams  as  Arthur Weasley , and  Julie Walters  as  Molly Weasley . \n The series has seen many returning crew members from various departments, including  Tim Burke , visual effects supervisor; Peter Doyle, digital film colourist;  Nick Dudman , make-up and creature effects designer;  David Holmes , stunt double;  Amanda Knight , make-up artist;  Stephenie McMillan , set designer;  Greg Powell , stunt coordinator; Jany Temime, costume designer; and  Fiona Weir , casting director. \n Set design \nThe Hall of  Christ Church  in  Oxford , England, the inspiration for the studio film set of The Great Hall of Hogwarts. [48] [49] \n The production designer for all eight films is  Stuart Craig . Assisted by  Stephenie McMillan , Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the  Ministry of Magic , the  Chamber of Secrets ,  Malfoy Manor , and the layout for the CGI  Horcrux Cave . Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts. [50] \nThe studio film set of The Great Hall of Hogwarts was one of the first sets ever created for the series. [51] \n He said, \"In the early days, every time you saw the exterior of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature,\" which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage. [52] [53]  \"We ended up with a profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [for buildings]. The [Astronomy Tower] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts \u2013 the big courtyard outside doubled in size, and if you look at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts.\" [54]  In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to \"embrace the latest technology\". [53] \n On the method of creating the sets, Craig said he often started by sketching ideas onto a blank sheet of paper. [55]  Stephanie McMillan also said that \"each film always had plenty of new challenges,\" citing the changes in visual style between directors and cinematographers as an example, along with the developing story in the novels. Due to J.K. Rowling's descriptions of various settings in the novels, Craig noted his \"responsibility was to place it together\". [56] \n Craig commented on his experience working in the studio environment: \"I'm the production designer, but on a big movie like  Harry Potter  I may be responsible for 30 to 35 people; from the supervising art director, and a team of art directors and assistants, to draughtsmen and junior draughtsmen, and then on to model makers, sculptors and scenic artists.\" He said, \"Ten years ago, all the  Harry Potter  drawings were done in pencil. I would take my roughs and plans and sections and give them to a professional architectural illustrator, who would create concept art using pencil and colour wash on watercolour paper.\" He said the process changed slightly throughout the years due to, what he called, the \"digital revolution\" of making films. [53] \n When filming of the series was completed, some of Craig's sets had to be rebuilt or transported for them to be displayed at the Warner Bros. studio tour. [52] \n Cinematography \n Six  directors of photography  worked on the series:  John Seale  on the first film,  Roger Pratt  on the second and fourth,  Michael Seresin  on the third,  S\u0142awomir Idziak  on the fifth,  Bruno Delbonnel  on the sixth, and  Eduardo Serra  on the seventh and eighth. Delbonnel was considered to return for both parts of  Deathly Hallows , but he declined, stating that he was \"scared of repeating\" himself. [57]  Delbonnel's cinematography in  Half-Blood Prince  gained the series its only  Academy Award  nomination for  Best Cinematography . As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways. [58]  Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made. [34] [59] \n Michael Seresin commented on the change of visual style from the first two films to  Prisoner of Azkaban : \"The lighting is moodier, with more shadowing and cross-lighting.\" Seresin and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n moved away from the strongly coloured and brightly lit cinematography of the first two films, with dimmer lighting and a more muted colour palette being utilised for the succeeding five films. [60]  After comparing a range of digital cameras with 35\u00a0mm film, Bruno Delbonnel decided to shoot the sixth movie,  Half-Blood Prince , on  film  rather than the increasingly popular  digital  format. This decision was kept for the two-part  Deathly Hallows  with Eduardo Serra, who said that he preferred to work with film because it was \"more technically accurate and dependable\". [61] \n Because the majority of  Deathly Hallows  takes place in various settings away from Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to \"shake things up\" by using different photographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera lenses. [62]  Eduardo Serra said, \"Sometimes we are combining elements shot by the main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You have to know what is being captured \u2013 colours, contrast, et cetera \u2013 with mathematical precision.\" He noted that with Stuart Craig's \"amazing sets and the story\", the filmmakers could not \"stray too far from the look of the previous  Harry Potter  films.\" [61] [63] \n Editing \n Along with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five  film editors  to work in post-production on the series:  Richard Francis-Bruce  edited the first instalment,  Peter Honess  the second,  Steven Weisberg  the third,  Mick Audsley  the fourth, and  Mark Day  films five through eight. \n Music \n See also:  Music of the Harry Potter films \n John Williams  scored the first three films and received  Academy Award  nominations for the first and third films. \n The  Harry Potter  series has had four composers.  John Williams  scored the first three films:  Philosopher's Stone ,  Chamber of Secrets , and  Prisoner of Azkaban . However, the second entry was adapted and conducted by  William Ross  due to Williams's conflicting commitments. Williams also created  Hedwig's Theme , which is used in every film in the series. \n After Williams left the series to pursue other projects,  Patrick Doyle  scored the fourth entry,  Goblet of Fire , which was directed by  Mike Newell , with whom Doyle had worked previously. In 2006,  Nicholas Hooper  started work on the score to  Order of the Phoenix  by reuniting with director  David Yates . Hooper also composed the soundtrack to  Half-Blood Prince  but decided not to return for the final films. \n In January 2010,  Alexandre Desplat  was confirmed to compose the score for  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 . [64]  The film's orchestration started in the summer with  Conrad Pope , the orchestrator on the first three  Harry Potter  films, collaborating with Desplat. Pope commented that the music \"reminds one of the old days.\" [65]  Desplat returned to score  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2  in 2011. [66] \n Director David Yates stated that he wanted John Williams to return to the series for the final installment, but their schedules did not align due to the urgent demand for a rough cut of the film. [67]  The final recording sessions of  Harry Potter  took place on 27 May 2011 at  Abbey Road Studios  with the  London Symphony Orchestra , orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat. [68] \n Doyle, Hooper, and Desplat introduced their own personal themes to their respective soundtracks, while keeping a few of John Williams's themes. \n Visual effects \n There have been many  visual effects  companies to work on the  Harry Potter  series. Some of these include  Rising Sun Pictures ,  Double Negative ,  Cinesite ,  Framestore , and  Industrial Light & Magic . The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with  Prisoner of Azkaban  and  Goblet of Fire , respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series. [69]  Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films. [70]  Producer  David Barron  said that \" Harry Potter  created the UK effects industry as we know it. On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west coast. But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones. They came up trumps.\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \"are bringing their work to UK effects companies. Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before  Harry Potter . That's really significant.\" [33] \n Final filming \n See also:  Production of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \n On 12 June 2010, filming of the  Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1  and  Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2  was completed with actor  Warwick Davis  stating on his Twitter account, \"The end of an Era \u2013 today is officially the last day of principal photography on 'Harry Potter' \u2013 ever. I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time. Farewell Harry & Hogwarts, it's been magic!\". [71]  However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010.

Rowling 's official website revealed the title of the final novel in the series \u2013  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows .

At the age of eleven, half-giant  Rubeus Hagrid  informs him that he is actually a  wizard  and that his parents were murdered by an evil wizard named  Lord Voldemort . Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the  Wizarding World  as a result. Harry begins his first year at  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends  Ron Weasley  and  Hermione Granger  become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the school. \n Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  (2002) \n Main article:  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) \n Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last.

Rowling. After the release of the  fourth book  in July 2000, the first film,  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , was released on 16 November 2001. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide. The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics. The fifth film,  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , was released by Warner Bros. on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July. [74]  The sixth,  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , was released on 15 July 2009 to critical acclaim and finished its theatrical run ranked as the number two grossing  film of 2009  on the worldwide charts. \n The final novel,  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , was split into two cinematic parts:  Part 1  was released on 19 November 2010, and  Part 2 , the conclusion to both the final film and the series, was released on 15 July 2011. [75]   Part 1  was originally scheduled to be released in  3D  and 2D, [76]  but due to a delay in the 3D conversion process, Warner Bros. released the film only in 2D and IMAX cinemas. However,  Part 2  was released in 2D and 3D cinemas as originally planned. [77] \n The television broadcast rights for the series in the United States are currently held by  Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television , which typically airs the films on the  Freeform  network. Disney's contract is expected to end in June 2018, after which,  NBCUniversal  will take control of the rights, after their deal with Warner Bros. was made in August 2016. [78]  The film series has accrued nearly 1.3 billion viewings since their television debut\u2014the highest-watched franchise in television broadcast history. [79] \n Reception \n Critical response \n All the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \"tent-poles\" akin to  James Bond ,  Star Wars ,  Indiana Jones  and  Pirates of the Caribbean . The series is noted by audiences for growing visually  darker  and more mature as each film was released. [34] [80] [81] [82] [83]  However, opinions of the films generally divide book fans, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films. \n Some also feel the series has a \"disjointed\" feel due to the changes in directors, as well as Michael Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore differing from that of Richard Harris. Author  J. K. Rowling  has been constantly supportive of the films, [84] [85] [86]  and evaluated  Deathly Hallows  as her favourite one in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, \"It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions \u2013 novels do not have constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers' imaginations\".

[105] [106] \n In addition, the  American Film Institute  recognised the entire series with a Special Award at the  American Film Institute Awards  in 2011. Special awards \"are given to outstanding achievements in the moving image that do not fit into AFI's criteria for the other honorees.\"  [107]  In its press release, the Institute referred to the films as \"a landmark series; eight films that earned the trust of a generation who wished for the beloved books of J.K. Rowling to come to life on the silver screen. The collective wizardry of an epic ensemble gave us the gift of growing older with Harry, Ron and Hermione as the magic of Hogwarts sprung from the films and into the hearts and minds of Muggles around the world.\"  [107] \n Harry Potter  was also recognised by the  BAFTA Los Angeles Britannia Awards , with David Yates winning the Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing for his four  Harry Potter  films.

However, others have pointed out that certain films in the series had uneven reviews, in contrast to the three films of  The Lord of the Rings , for example, which were all critically acclaimed. This has been partially attributed to the  Harry Potter  franchise going through several directors with their own styles in contrast to the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy, which was filmed in one massive undertaking by the same director, writer, and producer. [110] [111] \n Although not successful at the Oscars, the  Harry Potter  series has gained success in many other award ceremonies, including the annual  Saturn Awards  and  Art Directors Guild Awards .

The film also won a BMI Film Music award along with being nominated at the Grammy Awards, Visual Effect Society Awards, and the Amanda Awards.

[118]  The film was nominated at the BAFTA Awards, but did not win for Best Production Design or Best Special Visual Effects. [119]   Half-Blood Prince  was nominated for BAFTA Awards in Production Design and Visual Effects, [120]  and it was in the longlists for several other categories, including Best Supporting Actor for  Alan Rickman . [121]  Amongst other nominations and wins, the film also achieved Best Family Movie at the  National Movie Awards  as well as Best Live Action Family Film at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, along with being nominated for Best Motion Picture at the  Satellite Awards . \n Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1  gained two nominations at the BAFTA Awards for Best Make-Up and Hair and Best Visual Effects, along with receiving nominations for the same categories at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards.

[122] [123]   Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2  was released to critical acclaim, gaining a mix of audience awards. Part 2 of  Deathly Hallows  was also recognised at the Saturn Awards as well as the BAFTA Awards, where the film achieved a win for  Best Special Visual Effects . [124] \n Box office performance \n As of 2015 [update] , the  Harry Potter  film series is the  4th highest-grossing film franchise  of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7\u00a0billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22  James Bond  films and the six films in the  Star Wars  franchise. [125]   Chris Columbus 's  Philosopher's Stone  became the highest-grossing  Harry Potter  film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by  David Yates 's  Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 , while  Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n 's  Prisoner of Azkaban  grossed the least.

Most modern blockbuster franchises have two things in common: they are based on known properties such as books and comics, and they are steered by respected but little-known directors.\" \n \u2014 The Economist [150] \n The  Harry Potter  films and their success have been retrospectively considered to have had a significant impact on the  film industry . They are cited as having helped redefine the  Hollywood blockbuster  in the 21st century by initiating a shift toward established  media franchises  forming the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's release, Claudia Puig of  USA Today  wrote that the films \"inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic formula, spawning a range of copycats and wannabes\" and \"also have shown Hollywood how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs down.\" [151]  A 2009 article from  The Economist  argued that the films were \"in the vanguard\" of adaptations of established properties being the modern film franchise model, citing  The Lord of the Rings ,  Spider-Man  and  The Dark Knight Trilogy  as examples of successful film series that followed  Harry Potter ' s suit. [150]  Furthermore, the practice of splitting the finale of a film series into two  back-to-back films  began with the success of  Deathly Hallows , and it would soon be replicated by  The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug  and  The Battle of the Five Armies ,  The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Parts 1  and  2 ,  The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Parts 1  and  2 , and  Avengers: Infinity War  and its  untitled sequel . [152] \n The films are also widely credited with singlehandedly signalling the popularity of films based on  children's  and  young adult literature  in the 2000s and 2010s, correlating with the book series' own literary influence. Costance Grady and Aja Romano, commenting on the whole  Harry Potter  franchise's legacy for  Vox  in light of its 20th anniversary, wrote that youth-targeted literature has since become \"a go-to well of ideas for Hollywood,\" pointing to the successes of  The Twilight Saga ,  The Hunger Games  and  The Divergent Series .
