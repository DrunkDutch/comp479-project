Absolute positioning \n Open Issues \n 26. \"accesskey\" example \n Issue raised by:   Josh\nKrieger - 22 Jun 1998  and again by  Gregory\nRosmaita on 1 October 1999 .  Related issue by \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 . \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Status \n 8 June 2000 - Wendy Chisholm sent note to list. \n Issues \n The example places the \"accesskey\" attribute on the LABEL element\n    associated with the form control. Is it appropriate for the LABELs to have\n    \"accesskeys\" or should the controls have them? \n Does \"accesskeys\" introduce or create any usability issues? For example,\n    should this be a UA thing or should authors continue to create? \n What about pages that have too many elements to have unique accesskeys,\n    is this poor design? Should the form be broken up onto different\n  pages? \n Are there implications on future versions of HTML? \n How do users know which elements have defined accesskeys? \n Further discussion \n Some of the User Agent issues have been discussed on the User Agent mailing\nlist.  Refer to  Gregory\nRosmaita's post from 1 October 1999 .  Whereas Josh raises the issue about\naccesskeys within content conflicting, Gregory discusses that sometimes there\nis conflict between the content accesskey and the user agent shortcut key\n(alt+v is the example he uses).  Gregory suggests: \n as an interim kludge, authors could be encouraged (via the WCAG as an\n  \"until user agents support...\" clause) to provide a link to a page which\n  lists the accesskeys for the current page.   Example of a page\n  that lists accesskeys .  (note: the accesskey for the link to the\n  accesskey legend is k) \n Cynthia Shelley posted a\ntest file  with DIVs, accesskeys, and tabindex on 4 May 2000.   Gregory\nRosmaita's results from interacting with the test file .  On  17\nAugust, Cynthia  questions if accesskey only works on items with a\ntabindex. \n Wendy\nChisholm's keyboard acces test file  to test accesskey on label vs the form\ncontrol. \n Resolutions for 1.0 \n There most likely will be usability issues, but we will not be able to\ncover them in this initial release of the document. Therefore, this remains\nopen to be discussed for the next version. \n Proposals for 1.0 revised Techniques document \n None at this time. \n 27. Bidirectional tables \n Issue raised by:  Harvey Bingham - 28 April 1999 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issue: \n The writing direction for a table may be reversed, as part of I18N\n(Internationalization). Are there implications for table linearization? \n Actions: \n We discussed this at the 12 June 2000 telecon and determined that we needed\nmore information.  William Loughborough took an action item to ask Daniel\nDardailler how tablin handles bidirectional tables. \n 28. Using invisible images to provide\nredundant text links for server-side image maps \n Issue raised by: \nBill Shackleton - 10  April 1999 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issue: \n Should we discuss providing invisible/transparent images with alt-text as a\nsolution for providing redundant text links for server-side image maps? \n 29. CSS generated text \n Issue raised by:  Chris Lilley/Ian Jacobs - 5  May 1999 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issue: \n Style sheets may cause numbers or words to be generated. In the techniques\ndocument from 5 May, it says, \n  Text generated by style sheets is not part of the document source and will\n  not be available to assistive technologies that access content through DOM,\n  level 1 ([DOM1]). \nWe need to make it clearer in the guidelines that any important content\ninserted by a style sheet must be available in the document source as well\n(rationale: device-independence, users can override styles, etc.)\n Resolutions \n WL Ask Chris and Hakon about CSS generated text. \n CSS generated text is likely to be misused and we should add a\n    cautionary note to the CSS Techniques module. \n 30. Technique for server-side maps \n Issue raised by:  Al\nGilman - 16 Jun 1999 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issue: \n What does it take to make a server-side image map return a list of text\nlinks?  Do current user agents send 0,0 as coordinates if the return key is\npressed on an image map (rather than a mouse click)? \n Actions \n Dick Brown: Ask UA if user agents generate a 0,0 to the server if an area\non a server-side image map is not selected. We would like to know if redundant\ntext links could be returned if a server receives 0,0 but are not sure if all\nbrowsers generate it. [ From the 15 June 2000\ntelecon ] \n Resolution \n Based on UA's response, add to Techniques or not. \n 31. Missing discussion on checkpoint 7.3 \n Issue raised by: Chuck\nLetourneau - 13 Sep 1999 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issue \n \"Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid movement in\npages.\" points to section 4.9.2 - \"Visual information and motion\" in the\nTechnique document. However, there is no mention of freezing motion in section\n4.9.2.  We need discussion of this checkpoint. \n Update \n 13 June 2000 Wendy Chisholm - In the new, modularized format of the\ntechniques document, there are techniques for checkpoint 7.3 in the main\nmodule, the HTML module and the CSS module.  All of these sections need work.\nAlso need to add Scripting info the non-W3C technologies module (incorporate\nlessons from MWC page). Move some of the info from HTML to non-w3c?  actually,\nthese are specific to the HTML DOM so perhaps best to have a scripting/DOM\nsection for each technology? \n 32. Globalizing English-specifics \n Issue raised by:  Masafumi\nNakane - 15 August 2000 \n In relation to: Accessibility Themes \n Issues \n Be careful of the use of the word \"spell\" as it gives the impression\n    that these issues only apply to English or European languages. Replace\n    \"perfect spelling\" with \"exact match\" but not sure what to suggest for\n    other instances. \n Also be wary of discussion of writing-style.  Many of the examples and\n    discussion are very English-specific. \n The Gunning-Fog index is language specific. \n Either provide examples for multiple languages, or try to be\n    language-neutral. \n 33. Content negotiation \n Issue raised by:  Masafumi\nNakane - 15 August 2000 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issues \n In the HTML Techniques it says, \n Good link text should not be overly general; don't use \"click here.\" Not\n  only is this phrase device-dependent (it implies a pointing device) it says\n  nothing about what is to be found if the link if followed. Instead of \"click\n  here\", link text should indicate the nature of the link target, as in \"more\n  information about sea lions\" or \"text-only version of this page\". Note that\n  for the latter case (and other format- or language-specific documents),\n  content developers are encouraged to use content negotiation instead, so\n  that users who prefer text versions will have them served automatically. \n Content negotiation should not be used instead of a link to a text-only\npage.  Content negotiation should be used along with explicit links to\nalternative format and language versions. \n 34. Usage of \"movie\" and \"video\" \n Issue raised by:  Masafumi\nNakane - 15 August 2000 \n In relation to: The whole series of documents (primarily Accessibility\nThemes and HTML Techniques) \n Issues \n The words \"movie\" and \"video\" are used throughout the documents.  Either\nchoose one or the other term, or define them. Especially if they are used\ninterchangeably. \n 35. Flash \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: Non-W3C Techniques \n Issues \n Does Flash support synchronizing captions? (checkpoint 1.4) \n Mike\n    Williams (14 Sept 2000)  says that there are several white papers on\n    Flash that we could reformulate into the techniques document.  Any\n    volunteers? \n 36. User-selected style sheets \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issues \n Can you hide text equivalents for client side image maps with CSS\n    (checkpoint 1.5)? \n Provide an accessibility style sheet that shows them? \n Is there a good way to allow user-selected style sheets on a per-site\n    basis? \n 37. Tables for layout \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issues \n In HTML Techniques, need examples and more info on checkpoint 5.4 \n 38. Directly accessible\nscripts \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issues \n Should add examples for keyboard shortcuts.  Refer to Cynthia's message for\n proposed\nexample for checkpoint 6.3. \n 39. Automatic transfer of alternative pages \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques and Accessibility Themes \n Issues \n Discuss Cynthia's proposals for  techniques\nfor creating automatic server transfer to automatic pages . \n 40. Empty form controls \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: HTML Techniques \n Issues \n Are there still commonly used User Agents that have problems with this? How\ndo we decide when an \"until user agents\" clause has been met? \n 41. Units of measure \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: CSS Techniques \n Issues \n Is it ok to use x-small, small, medium, large, etc. CSS font sizes? \n Charles\n    (15 Sept 2000)  believe it is ok. \n 42. Absolute positioning \n Issues raised by: \nCynthia Shelley - 17 August 2000 \n In relation to: CSS Techniques \n Issues \n Need an example of accessible absolute positioning. \n possible examples to use:\n http://www.w3.org/Style \n http://www.sidar.org \n 43. Accessible text \n William\nLoughborough - 22 Sept 2000 . In the Core Techniques we need to make it\nclear that not all users can easily use text. \n Closed Issues \n ASCII art \n D-Link Reference for Browser Detection \n  (UA) \n Long descriptions on OBJECT without\n    \"longdesc\"  (UA) \n Definitions for alt, title, and\n    longdesc. \n Definitions for \"rel\" values on links. \n Color design guidelines and examples \n Recommendations for future versions of\n  HTML \n \"d-link\" with frames \n CSS2 vs. frames \n Using NOFRAMES in a BODY element. \n The LAYER element \n Device-dependent events \n CSS recommendations \n The EMBED element \n Specifying foreground and background\n    colors \n Why use EMBED/NOEMBED for applets instead of\n    APPLET \n Table examples (PRE) \n Label in form example \n Content negotiation \n Grouping and bypassing links \n Proposal for accessible list\n  example \n User agent support page \n Spacer images examples \n Satisfying the alternative page checkpoint\n    with phone, fax, or postal address. \n Abbreviations for table headers \n 1. ASCII art \n Issue raised by:   T.V.\nRaman - 15 Apr 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n How should we handle ASCII art? \n Proposals \n Avoid it. \n Use it with images and alt-text (for non-css browsers). \n Use style sheets. See  Daniel's\n    example \n Use OBJECT. See  \n    John T. Whelan's example \n Resolution and actions \n There is a difference between decorative and critical ASCII art (as\nwith \n use within the OBJECT element (as per existing example) \n replace with image and alt-text \n for emoticons: use ABBR or SPAN with \"title\" (as per existing SPAN example,\npropose to include ABBR) \n 2. D-Link Reference for Browser Detection \n Issue raised by:   Ian\nJacobs - 2 Jun 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n A potential option for browsers is the ability to hide D-Links. To do this\na browser needs to identify the links that it should hide. There are two\ncurrent choices to do this. \n Proposals \n Use the \"rel\" attribute of A and LINK with a reserved word like \"dlink\".\n    This method is consistent with the meaning of \"rel\" for defining\n    relationships between information. \n Use \"class\" attribute to specify a class like \"wai-dlink\". Advantage is\n    that it is supported in the CSS1 specification. \n A more generic use of the REL attribute of the ANCHOR tag for adding\n    semantic markup of the document\ufffd is that REL could be used for not only\n    identifying D-Links, but site navigation anchors and items in or for a\n    table of contents for a dcoument. UAs could use this information to create\n    pop up lists.\ufffd This could be part of the META information section of the\n    PA guidelines. \n Resolution and actions \n The group agreed that we ought to lean into the future on issues like\nd-link where an elegant solution has been devised but not widely supported.\nTherefore, we ought to highlight the use of \"longdesc.\" Until \"longdesc\" is\nwidely supported a proxy or some tool could convert \"longdesc's\" to d-links.\nThus, Daniel will take the idea to the ER Working group. However, where\ninformation is critical for understanding TODAY, d-links are still a top\npriority (until a proxy and/or user agent supports longdesc). \n Conclusion: we don't need to create a standardized way of marking up\nd-links. Instead we ought to focus on pushing someone to create a tool that\nwill convert longdesc to d-link (for short-term and backwards compatibile\nsolutions). \n 3 Long descriptions on OBJECT without\n\"longdesc\" \n Issue raised by:   Jon\nGunderson - 5 Jun 1998  and  Chuck\nLetourneau - 29 Jul 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n OBJECT does not have \"longdesc\" so the techniques are not consistent\n    between IMG, FRAME and OBJECT. \n What about nested OBJECTs? \n Proposals \n free style: in the object content, which is its short description, put a\n    link to the long description in plain french or using a D. \n    <OBJECT DATA=\"gif\"> photo of the earth from space <A\n    HREF=\"long.htm\">D</A> </OBJECT> \n rel convention: in addition to free style, you mark the A to the long\n    desc with rel=longdesc (or dlink)  \n    <OBJECT DATA=\"gif\"> photo of the earth from space <A\n    REL=\"longdesc\" HREF=\"long.htm\">D</A> </OBJECT> \n using param:  \n    <OBJECT DATA=\"gif\"> photo of the earth from space <A\n    HREF=\"long.htm\">D</A> <PARAM NAME=\"longdesc\"\n    VALUE=\"long.htm\"> </OBJECT> \n Resolution and actions \n In the issues list, it is noted that there is concern that the techniques\nbetween OBJECT, IMG, and FRAME are not consistent and therefore might be\nconfusing for authors. While confusing, the differences stem from OBJECT being\ndesigned to alleviate issues caused by the original design of IMG, APPLET, and\nthe non-standard EMBED. Therefore, we ought to recommend that OBJECT be used\nas designed: textual content ought to always be used within the content of\nOBJECT (whether it be a short \"alternative text-type\" of phrase, or a long\ndescription) and that \"title\" ought to be used as a name, but not\nrequired. \n 4 Definitions for alt, title, and\nlongdesc \n Issue raised by:  ??? \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n Have we clearly made the distinction between alternative text, long\n    descriptions, and title and when to use each? \n Resolution and actions \n Section A.2 of the Techniques Document has been rewritten to handle this\nissue. \n 5. Definition of \"rel\" values on links \n Issue raised by: ??? \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n Should we define and recommend that the following \"rel\" values be used: \n dlink Mark a link as an image descriptor (see also the \" D-Link Reference for Browser Detection \"\n  discussion) \n navbar Mark a link as part of a navbar \n lintable Mark a link as part of a linearized table \n transcript Mark a link as a transcript of a audio file \n Are there others we want to define? \n Resolution and actions \n The following \"rel\" values on links have been proposed. We determined we\ndid not need any of them per the reasoning that follows each proposal. \n 7.1. dlink Mark a link as an image descriptor (see also the \"D-Link\nReference for Browser Detection\" discussion) - since we determined earlier in\nthe call that we ought to focus on \"longdesc\" rather than d-link and that a\ntool could be created to convert a \"longdesc\" to a d-link, we don't see this\nas necessary. \n 7.2. navbar Mark a link as part of a navbar - due to agreement on how to\nhandle groups of links in a later issue (\"Grouping and bypassing links\") it\nwas determined that this rel value was not needed. \n 7.3. lintable Mark a link as part of a linearized table - once again, this\nis not needed because of other guidelines related to tables and tools that are\nin development that can navigate tables. \n 7.4. transcript Mark a link as a transcript of a audio file - this can be\nhandled using OBJECT by either including the text of the trascript in the body\nof the element or linking to from within the body. Also, SMIL can handle.\ntherefore it is not necessary. \n 7.5. Are there others we want to define? Although it is a neat idea, we\ncould not think of any that we need to define at this time. \n 6. Color design guidelines and examples \n Issue raised by:   Harvey\nBingham - 20 Aug 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n Is more information about designing with color needed? \n Proposals \n Link to articles and sites with examples. \n Incorporate existing guidelines into the Guidelines and Techniques\n    documents. \n Resolution and actions \n We determined that we do not need to include further instruction in\ndesigning color contrast since other places, particularly the Lighthouse do a\nfine job. Therefore, we already link to them and this is sufficient. Also,\nwith the emphasis on style sheets and the ability of users to overwrite author\nsettings, the emphasis on the accessibility of this issue diminishes. \n 7. Recommendations for future versions of\nHTML \n Issue raised by:   1998JulSep/0187 \n3 Sep 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n There has been quite a bit of discussion concerning the current release of\nHTML and suggestions for how to make it better. For example, people have been\nconcerned with inconsistencies such as OBJECT/title vs. IMG/alt, the desire to\nsee MAPs contain block level content, the ability to nest OPTGROUPs and\nreplace device-dependent events with \"logical\" events. \n Proposal \n Send these suggestions to PF to investigate. \n Resolutions and actions \n Sent to Al to send to PF. \n 8. \"d-link\" with frames \n Issue raised by:   1998JulSep/0064 \n23 Jul 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n What is the appropriate way to use d-link with frames? \n Proposals \n <A href=\"dframe1.htm\" title=\"description of this frame and its place\n    in the universe\">D</A> \n However, \"one can't put anchors in the FRAMESET, and the FRAME elementis\n    empty. The idea is to describe the frames in the NOFRAMES section? If so,\n    I don't like it. The NOFRAMES section hould \"behave\" like a normal page,\n    as if the site has no frames.\" \n Resolutions and actions \n We concluded that the best place for a \"d-link\" to appear on a frameset is\nwithin the content of NOFRAMES since the \"longdesc\" on FRAME was intended to\ndescribe the frames role in relation to the other frames. The NOFRAME\ndescription can act as an overview. Also, see the discussion on d-links. If\n\"longdesc\" is provided on frames, the proposed \"d-link-to-longdesc\" tool would\ntake the longdescs from the frames and put them in the NOFRAMES. \n 9. CSS2 vs. frames \n Issue raised by: Nir\nDagan - 03 Jul 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n Frames are a presentational hint, for particular media. Therefore,\n    stylesheets should be used for making frames. \n However, not all uses of frames may be generated with CSS2 \n Proposals \n Although, it is not possible to duplicate all uses of frames with CSS2,\nmost of the uses may be accomplished and the authoring guidelines should point\nthat out. \n Resolutions and actions \n We determined that there is at least one good use of frames that can not be\naccomplished using style sheet positioning: one frame is an index of\ndocuments, the other frame is where the content of selected documents appears.\nWe agree there are problems with frames, but at this point they can't be ruled\nout entirely. However, we wish to discourage the use of frames in favor of\nstyle sheet positioning where applicable. This is similar to our position on\ntables - don't use them for layout, use positioning. Again, we wish to look to\nthe future with our recommendations on this issue. \n 10. Using NOFRAMES in a BODY element \n Issue raised by:   Daniel\nDardailler - 04 Sep 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  22 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n It seems that the HTML 4.0 spec allows NOFRAMES to appear in the BODY\n    element and not just in the FRAMESET element. \n This implies that more elegant solutions could be proposed for NOFRAME\n    content. \n Proposal \n Create and test new examples. If they work add to the techniques doc. \n Resolutions and actions \n The goal was to be able to include the navigation links on a page within\nthe conent of a NOFRAMES in the BODY of one of the defined FRAMEs. This way if\na browser doesn't support frames (or they are turned off) the navigation links\nare loaded and then the user may open any of the pages in its own window. \n However, this is not how it worked. In Opera, when frames were loaded, the\ncontents of NOFRAMES were displayed (as anticipated) but when frames were not\nloaded, the contents of NOFRAMES were not loaded (only the contents of the\nNOFRAMES from the FRAMESET were loaded. \n This is also the way it worked in Lynx. This makes sense, because I don't\nsee that a browser would realistically walk the tree of defined documents\nwithin a frameset looking for a NOFRAMEs element. \n 11. The LAYER element \n Issue raised by:   Jon\nGunderson - 2 Dec 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  18 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n LAYER is proprietary, so should not be used according to A.14 \n Proposals \n Recommend using CSS instead of LAYER. \n Things that can do with LAYER that can't do with CSS, but it goes\n    against A.14. \n Resolutions and actions \n We do not need to specifically mention the LAYER element since it is\n    covered by \"use-w3c\" \n Added \"layering\" to list of things to do with CSS (Layout, positioning,\n    layering, and alignment) \n 12. Device-dependent events \n Issue raised by:   Charles\nMcCathieNevile - 22 Oct 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  20 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n The use of device-dependent evetns (onMouseOver, onFocus, etc) can cause\n    problems, because only some of these events have keyboard (let alone\n    voice-input) equivalents. \n Current version of the guidelines contains: \n A.9.3 For scripts that present critical information or functions,\n    provide an alternative, equivalent presentation or mechanism (e.g., by\n    using NOSCRIPT in HTML, or a server-side script). [Priority 1] \n A.9.5 For applets and programmatic objects, at a minimum, follow the\n    techniques for alternative text and long descriptions, where needed. \n A.9.6 For applets and programmatic objects, when possible provide an\n    alternative function or presentation in a format other than an applet. For\n    example, a canned \"mpeg\" movie of a physics simulation (written in Java)\n    or a single frame of the animation saved as a \"gif\" image. [Priority\n  2] \n A.11.1 Where possible, make programmatic elements, such as scripts and\n    applets, directly accessible. (See also A.9). [Priority 1] if information\n    or functionality is important, and not presented elsewhere, otherwise\n    [Priority 2]. \n Proposals \n It needs to be talked through with UA, PF and DOM \n Suggest that only logical events (onFocus, onBlur, onSelect, onChange,\n    onSubmit, onReset, onLoad, onUnload) should be used, rather than\n    device-dependent (onMousedown, onMouseup, onMouseover, onMousemove,\n    onMouseout, onKeydown, onKeyup, onKeypress, onClick, onDblclick). \n HOWEVER, that might be a little too restrictive for authors. How about\n    asking that both devices (pointer and keyboard) be supported for each\n    event (e.g., <ELEMENT ... onclick=\"verify()\"\n    onKeypress=\"verify()\">). \n Encourage the use of application-level events (onFocus and onBlur) while\n    discouraging the use of action-level events. \n Distinguish between events which are the direct result of user action\n    (e.g., onSubmit, onReset, onFocus, onBlur) and those that occur\n    asynchronously asking that both devices (pointer and keyboard) be\n    supported for each event (e.g., <ELEMENT ... onclick=\"verify()\"\n    onKeypress=\"verify()\">). \n Encourage the use of application-level events (onFocus and onBlur) while\n    discouraging the use of action-level events. \n Distinguish between events which are the direct result of user action\n    (e.g., onSubmit, onReset, onFocus, onBlur) and those that occur\n    asynchronously or represent an unexpected result (e.g., onLoad,\n  onError). \n Define something like 'onActivate' - which would be equivalent to\n    onClick for a link. \n The guidelines should say something re: DHTML, probably in A.11 make a\n    general statement and a technique. \n Resolutions and Actions \n Items 2,3,4, and 5 are dealt with in latest release of techniques\n  doc. \n DHTML defined in Guidelines doc. \n Has been discussed with PF and UA. \n 13. CSS recommendations \n Issue raised by:   Nir\nDagan - 23 Nov 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  18 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n This issue is carried over from the Guidelines open issue list. See  Style sheets in the\nguidelines \n Tips for style sheets are needed. \n Are these just good design or increased accessibility? \n Proposals \n see  Nir's\n    message  (and the following threads) for proposed techniques and\n    wording. \n Daniel is following up with the W3C CSS gurus for suggestions. \n Resolutions and Actions \n Daniel sent proposed wording for CSS suggestions. These have been\n    incorporated, with examples, into the techniques doc. \n 14. The EMBED element \n Issue raised by:   Jon\nGunderson - 2 Dec 1998 \n Issue resolved on:  18 Feb 1999 \n Issues \n EMBED is proprietary, so should not be used according to A.14 \n OBJECT will do the work of EMBED, but until it is implemented we ought\n    to suggest how it ought to be used since EMBED, whether we like it or not,\n    will continue to be used to include multimedia on pages. \n Proposals \n You can compose a SMIL presentation with the web page on layer 1 and the\n    video on layer 2, where it hides a static GIF placeholder for those\n    lacking the video player. I think you can, anyway. \n Only use EMBED within the content of an OBJECT, especially for legacy\n    applications. \n EMBED is proprietary, so should not be used according to A.14 \n Resolutions and Actions \n An EMBED example (nested within OBJECT) has been added to the techniques\ndoc. \n 15. Specifying foreground and background\ncolors \n Issue raised by:  Philip Newton - 7 May 1999 \n Status \n Wendy\n    Chisholm sent a proposal to the list 8 June 2000 \n Issue: \n If the author specifies a background color, they should also specify the\nforeground color (and vice versa), otherwise if the user has selected a\nparticular foreground color that does not contrast well with the author's\nbackground color, the page will be unreadable. \n Proposed Resolution \n While the user should be able to adjust preferences on the user agent, it\nis good design. Therefore, it seems to make sense to discuss in techniques\ndoc. \n 16. Why use EMBED/NOEMBED for applets instead of\nAPPLET \n Issue raised by:   \nNir Dagan - 17 March 1998 \n I can't see why the recommendation using EMBED / NOEMBED for an applet.\n  authors concerned with backward compatibility with browsers that do not\n  support OBJECT should use the deprecated APPLET element, which is a part of\n  the specs for exactly this purpose. \n One may consider using EMBED for some other object, say an MPEG video.\n  However in this case one should also supply a DTD with which people who\n  follow the recommended technique may use to validate their documents. \n Resolution \n 13 June 2000. Wendy Chisholm. I don't find the example he is talking about.\nSince this is so old I assume it is from a very old version of the techniques.\nIt doesn't appear in there now. \n 17. Table examples (PRE) \n Issue raised by:  Al\nGilman - 21 April 1999 \n Issue: \n One possibility for creating accessible versions of tables, is to use PRE.\n(yikes!).  For an example, see  The Tri-Met bus\nschedule . \n Resolution \n 13 June 2000. PRE is not an accessibe method to markup data tables since it\ndoes not capture structure or semantics. \n 18. Label in form example \n Issue raised by:  James Salsman - 5 April 1999 \n Issue: \n Why don't the examples in the Forms section (such as 4.11.5) implicitly\nassociate the form control with the LABEL by putting the form control in the\nLABEL content (as is demonstrated in the HTML4 spec)? \n Having a label (at least in IE5) increases the surface area available to\nactivate the form element, which is an accessibility feature for those with\northopedic disabilities. (David Clark 4 Jun 1999) \n Resolution \n 13 June 2000 Wendy Chisholm.  I added the following text to the section\ntitled, \"Labeling form controls\" \n A label is implicitly associated with its form control either through\n  markup or positioning on the page. The following example shows  how a label\n  and form control may be implicitly associated with  markup. \n Example. \n <LABEL for=\"firstname\">First name:  \n  <INPUT type=\"text\" id=\"firstname\" tabindex=\"1\"> \n  </LABEL> \n 19. Content negotiation and links to alt\nversions \n Issue raised by:   \nNir Dagan - 17 March 1998 \n Status \n Wendy Chisholm sent note to list 8 June 2000. \n Issue \n I think one should use both content negotiation and include links to\nalternative versions. Content negotiation determines the default format\nserved, but: \n a user may prefer French to English, but may still prefer to have access\n    to both versions. \n User agents may not support content negotiation well and the format\n    served to the user may be not the optimal one. \n Resolutions \n 13 June 2000. Wendy Chisholm. The main techniques module, section 5.7\n(Content Negotiation) was edited to read: \n Use content negotiation to serve content per the client request.  For\n    example, serve the French version of a document to clients requesting\n    French. \n If not possible to use content negotiation, indicate content type or\n    language through markup (e.g., in HTML use \"type\" and \"hreflang\"). \n Include links to other versions of content, such as translations. For\n    example, the link \"Refer to the French version of this document\"  links to\n    the French version. \n 20. Grouping and bypassing links \n Issue raised by:   Al\nGilman - 4 Nov 1998  (also see the IG archive for  Paul\nAdelson's 15 Jul 1998 note  and  the minutes from the 5\nNovember telecon ) \n Issue resolved on:  4 Feb 1999 \n Issue reopened on:   \nIan Jacobs - 9 July 1999 \n Issues \n \"Navigation bars\" (sets of links that appear on every page in a site) are\nusually the first thing someone encounters on a page. For speech users, this\nmeans taking the time to read through x number of links on every page before\nreaching the \"meat.\" \n Proposals \n Recommend that navigation bars be placed at the bottom of a page. \n Before the navigation bar, create a link that links to an anchor just\n    following the nav bar (using LINK element, such as <LINK\n    rel=\"start-reading\" href=\"#start-reading\">). \n Mark up the group with some structural element (such as SPAN, P, DIV,\n    etc.) with class=\"nav.\" Then user can do whatever they want using style\n    sheets. \n Use the MAP element (without an image) to group links to create a\n    navigation bar. \n Set \"tabindex=1\" for anchor after the navigation bar. \n Of the five proposals, a hybrid approach of a few of them is what the group\non the call was happiest with. Therefore, we propose two strategies. The first\nshould always happen, the second is supplemental. \n 11.1 Group related links (such as those in a navigation bar) using any\nappropriate element (P, FRAME, DIV, SPAN) and label the group with\nclass=\"nav\" \n 11.2 Use \"tabindex=1\" on a link that appears at the beginning of the \"meat\"\nof the content. \n A further conclusion is that we do not want to recommend the MAP element as\na way to group links since it is a non-standard use of the element. \n Further discussion \n At the request of the UA group, this item has been reopened for\n    discussion. Another solution that UA has discussed is the use of meta\n    data.  How would this work for today's browsers and authors? \n 19990917 - The group is discussing  the\n    latest proposal . \n 199909 -  Al\n    recommends  rewriting the navigation and validation sections to\n    highlight the new techniques. Work on this item postponed until the other\n    oustanding deliverables are finished. \n Resolution \n April 2000 HTML Techniques module is updated. \n 21. Proposal for accessible list\nexample \n Issue raised by:   \nIan - 19 March 1998 \n Proposal for describing how to make a list accessible, using CSS1, CSS2, or\norienting info. \n Proposal \n 14 June 2000 Wendy Chisholm and Ian Jacobs propose that authors should not\nhave to do this.  Mark up the list correctly.  It is the User Agent\nresponsibility to allow the user to navigate through the correctly marked up\nlist. \n 22. User agent support page \n Issue raised by: The Editors - 24  May 1999 \n Issue: \n How can the working group help keep the user agent support page up to\ndate? \n Resolution \n Leave the User Agent Support Page as is for now. If people find relevant\nresources, post to list for inclusion in references.[ From the 15 June 2000\ntelecon ] \n 23. Spacer images examples \n Issue raised by:   \nBruce Bailey - 21 May 1999 \n Issue: \n Older versions of the techniques document (such as the 19980918 draft) seem\nto represent the ideas better than the current version (19990505).  It is not\nclear why the example is deprecated nor what it implies should be used\ninstead. \n Proposal \n /* find my proposal to ER and GL from last fall. this is a rat hole. it\nneeds resolution. */ \n Resolution \n To provide author with information and let them decide to use \"\" or \" \" for\ndecorational images.[ From the 15 June 2000\ntelecon ] \n 24. Satisfying the alternative page checkpoint\nwith phone, fax, or postal address. \n Issue raised by:  Eric\nHansen - 29  April 1999 \n Issue: \n \"Provide a phone number, fax number, e-mail, or postal address where\ninformation is available and accessible, preferably 24 hours a day.\" Should\nthis count as an accessible \"page\"? \n Resolution \n Providing a phone number, fax number, e-mail address, or postal address\nwhere info is available, preferably 24 hours a day does not count as an\nalternative accessible page. [ From the 15 June 2000\ntelecon ] \n 25. Abbreviations for table headers \n Issue raised by :  Al\nGilman - 24 Nov 1999 \n Issue \n Currently we only discuss using the \"abbr\" attribute to shorten long\nheading names.  What about using ABBR to expand abbreviated heading names? \n Resolution \n Clarify in HTML Techniques that the principles of ABBR apply no matter\nwhere they are, in a table heading or not.
