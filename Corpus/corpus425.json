(April 2017)   ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n littleBits  is a  New York City -based startup that makes an  open source  library of modular electronics ( open-source electronics ), which snap together with small magnets for prototyping and learning. [1] [2]  The company\u2019s goal is to democratize hardware the way software and printing have been democratized. [3]  The littleBits mission is to \"put the power of electronics in the hands of everyone, and to break down complex technologies so that anyone can build, prototype, and invent.\" [4]  littleBits units are available in more than 70 countries and used in more than 2,000 schools. [5]  The company was named to  CNN\u2019s  10 Startups to Watch for 2013.

[7]  She launched littleBits in September 2011. [8] \n In June 2015, littleBits raised $44.2 million in Series B funding led by DFJ Growth. [9]  In November 2013, littleBits received $11.1 million in funding led by True Ventures and Foundry Group, with participation from  Two Sigma Ventures , Vegas Tech Fund, and  Khosla Ventures , among others. [10] \n Products [ edit ] \nThe LittleBits synth kit \nA system assembled using  littleBits  modules \n In August 2013, the company released the Base, Premium and Deluxe Kits, the first kits to feature the current bits and modules. The goal is to make getting started with littleBits easier and containing the most important modules than other kits. \nGirl playing with  littleBits . \n In July 2014, littleBits introduced cloudBit, a WiFi-enabled module that lets builders add Internet connectivity to their designs. [11]  The goal is to give \"the average person an easy and open way to contribute to the  Internet of Things \" [11]  using an open-source platform comparable to  Linux  or  Android [12]  to build such things as a remote control for coffee makers, heating/cooling systems, or other appliances. [13] \n In November 2014, the company released the Smart Home Kit, designed to let builders \"hack together versions of familiar smart-home concepts\u2014connected coffee pots and presence-aware lamps\u2014or create solutions of their own devising.\" [14]  Using the modules, builders could test smart home gadgets of their own designs to \"feel out this new territory for themselves\" instead of \"taking some company\u2019s word on what your smart home should be.\" [14] \n Uses and partnerships [ edit ] \n littleBits consists of small circuit boards with specific functions built to snap together with magnets [15]  without soldering, wiring, or programming. Each bit has its own specific function, such as light, sound, sensors, or buttons. [2]  There are \"trillions of billions of combinations\" possible in the littleBits open source library. [5] \n NASA  has collaborated with littleBits to design projects for a littleBits \u2018Space Kit.\u2019 [16]  Projects include building a model  Mars Rover  and the wireless transmission of music to a model of the  International Space Station .\u2019 [16]  In October 2014, the Space Kit won a  Fast Company  \"Innovation by Design\" award. [17] \n In 2013, littleBits partnered with the  Museum of Modern Art  Stores in New York to build two window displays, which included a giant ferris wheel \"propelled by a miniature cyclist\" and a \"mad scientist controlling a nearly life-sized puppet.\" [18]  Also in 2013, littleBits collaborated with  KORG  to create the Synth Kit, allowing users to build a DIY synthesizer or create musical instruments. [19] \n Marketplace and Retail Store [ edit ] \n In September 2014, littleBits announced bitLab, a marketplace for products built using littleBits kits and modules. [20]  The \"app store for hardware\" is the \"first marketplace for user-generated hardware\" (according to Bdeir) [21]  and has the potential to become \"the most extensive platform for hardware creation and innovation available.\" [22] \n In July 2015, littlebits opened a retail store in  Soho, Manhattan . The store has an innovative retail model that allows users to either use the littlebits product for free in-store (\"Inventions to Stay\"), or to build something, pay for the components, and take it away (\"Inventions to Go\"). [23] [24] \n Role in Maker movement [ edit ] \n The first launch of littleBits was at Makerfaire 2009. littleBits won Editor\u2019s Choice awards in 2009 and 2011 from  MAKE magazine . [25]  The company has organized a series of  hackathons  and workshops to encourage active participation in science and technology. [5]  CEO Bdeir was named to  Popular Mechanics\u2019  25 Makers Who Are Reinventing the American Dream in 2014, [26]   Inc.\u2019s  35 Under 35 Coolest Entrepreneurs, [3]  and Fast Company\u2019s Most Creative People of 2013.
