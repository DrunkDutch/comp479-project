She was known for providing glamour and sophistication to  war-torn  London audiences with her lightweight musicals, comedies and historical dramas. Almost all of her films were produced and directed by  Herbert Wilcox , whom she married in 1943. \n In her historical dramas Anna Neagle was renowned for her portrayals of British historical figures, including  Nell Gwynn  ( Nell Gwynn , 1934),  Queen Victoria  ( Victoria the Great , 1937 and  Sixty Glorious Years , 1938) and  Edith Cavell  ( Nurse Edith Cavell , 1939). \n Contents \n 1   Biography \n 1.1   Early life \n 1.2   Cinematic beginnings \n 1.3   An American excursion \n 1.4   Back to Britain \n 1.5   On the wane \n 1.6   Final years \n 2   Awards \n 3   Filmography \n 4   Recordings by Anna Neagle \n 5   Box office popularity \n 6   Publications \n 7   Footnotes \n 8   External links \n Biography [ edit ] \n Early life [ edit ] \n Neagle was born in  Forest Gate ,  Essex , daughter to Herbert Robertson, a  Merchant Navy  captain, and his wife, the former Florence Neagle. [1]  Her older brother was the bass-baritone and actor Stuart Robertson (1901-1958). [2]  Robertson attended primary school in  Glasgow  and then  St Albans High School for Girls . [ citation needed ]  She made her stage debut as a dancer in 1917, and later appeared in the chorus of C.B. Cochran's  revues  and also Andr\u00e9 Charlot's revue  Bubbly . While with Cochran she understudied  Jessie Matthews . [3] \n In 1931 she starred in the West End musical  Stand Up and Sing  (1931), with actor  Jack Buchanan , who encouraged her to take a featured role. For this play she began using the professional name of  Anna Neagle  (the surname being her mother's maiden name). [4]  The play was a success with a total run of 604 performances. [4]   Stand Up and Sing  provided her big break when film producer and director  Herbert Wilcox , who had caught the show purposely to consider Buchanan for an upcoming film, but also took note of her cinematic potential. [5] \n Cinematic beginnings [ edit ] \n \"Naturally enough when I was a young dancer, I was terribly anxious to get ahead, and to get ahead quickly. I was impatient with all those older people who talked of the long grind to the top, who turned me down for jobs I knew I could do.\" \n Anna Neagle [6] \n Forming a professional alliance with Wilcox, Neagle played her first starring film role in the  musical   Goodnight, Vienna  (1932), again with Jack Buchanan. With this film Neagle became an overnight favourite. Although the film cost a mere \u00a323,000 to a produce, it was a hit at the box office, profits from its Australian release alone being \u00a3150,000. [7] \n After her starring role in  The Flag Lieutenant  (also 1932), directed by and co-starring  Henry Edwards , she worked exclusively under Wilcox's direction for all but one of her subsequent films, [4]  becoming one of Britain's biggest stars. \n She continued in the musical genre, co-starring with Fernand Gravey (later known as Fernand Gravet) in  Bitter Sweet  (1933). This first version of  No\u00ebl Coward 's tale of ill-fated lovers was later obscured by the better known  Jeanette MacDonald \u2013 Nelson Eddy  remake in 1940. [4] \n Neagle had her first major success with  Nell Gwynn  (1934), which Wilcox had previously shot as a  silent  starring  Dorothy Gish  in 1926. Neagle's performance as  the woman  who became the mistress of  Charles II  (Sir  Cedric Hardwicke ) prompted some  censorship in the United States . The  Hays Office  had Wilcox add a (historically false) scene featuring the two leads getting married and also a \"framing\" story resulting in an entirely different ending. [8]   Graham Greene , then a film critic, said of  Nell Gwynn : \"I have seen few things more attractive than Miss Neagle in breeches\". [7] \n Two years after  Nell Gwynn , she followed up with another real-life figure, portraying Irish actress  Peg Woffington  in  Peg of Old Drury  (1936). That same year she appeared in  Limelight , a backstage film musical in which she played a chorus girl. Her co-star was  Arthur Tracy , who had gained fame in the United States as a radio performer known as 'The Street Singer'. The film also featured Jack Buchanan in an uncredited cameo. [9]  performing \"Goodnight Vienna\". [5] \n Neagle and Wilcox followed with a  circus   trapeze  fable  Three Maxims  (1937), which was released in the United States as  The Show Goes On . The film, with a script featuring a contribution from  Herman J. Mankiewicz  (later to co-write  Citizen Kane  with  Orson Welles ), had Neagle performing her own high-wire acrobatics. [7]  Although now highly successful in films, Neagle continued acting on stage. In 1934, while working under director Robert Atkins, she performed as Rosalind in  As You Like It  and Olivia in  Twelfth Night . Both productions earned her critical accolades, despite the fact that she had never performed  Shakespearean  roles before. [4] \n In 1937 Neagle gave her most prestigious performance so far \u2013 as  Queen Victoria  in the historical drama  Victoria the Great  (1937), co-starring  Anton Walbrook  as  Prince Albert . The script by  Robert Vansittart  and  Miles Malleson  (from  Laurence Housman 's play  Victoria Regina ) alternated between the political and the personal lives of the royal couple. [7]  The  Diamond Jubilee  sequence that climaxed the film was shot in  Technicolor .  Victoria the Great  was such an international success that it resulted in Neagle and Walbrook playing their roles again in an all-Technicolor sequel entitled  Sixty Glorious Years  (1938), co-starring  C. Aubrey Smith  as the  Duke of Wellington . While the first of these films was in release, Neagle returned to the London stage and entertained audiences with her portrayal of the title role in  Peter Pan . [4] \n An American excursion [ edit ] \nAnna Neagle gives a radio interview in Montreal in 1937. \n The success of  Victoria the Great  and  Sixty Glorious Years  caused  Hollywood  studios to take notice. Neagle and Wilcox began an association with  RKO Radio Pictures . Their first American film was  Nurse Edith Cavell  (1939), a remake of  Dawn , a Wilcox  silent  that starred  Sybil Thorndike . In this, another Neagle role based on an actual British heroine, she played the role of  the nurse  who was shot by the  Germans  in World War I for alleged spying. The resulting effort had a significant impact for audiences on the eve of  war . [7] \n In a turnabout from this serious drama, the couple followed with three musical comedies, all based on once-popular stage plays. The first of these was  Irene  (1940), co-starring  Ray Milland . It included a Technicolor sequence, which featured Neagle singing the play's most famous song, \"Alice Blue Gown\". She followed this film with  No, No, Nanette  (1940) with  Victor Mature , in which she sang \" Tea For Two \", and  Sunny  (1941), with  Ray Bolger . \n Neagle and Wilcox's final American film was  Forever and a Day  (1943), a tale of a London family house from 1804 to the 1940  blitz . This film boasts 80 performers (mostly expatriate British), including Ray Milland, C. Aubrey Smith,  Claude Rains ,  Charles Laughton  and \u2013 among the few North Americans \u2013  Buster Keaton . Wilcox directed the sequence featuring Neagle, Milland, Smith and Rains, while other directors who worked on the film included  Ren\u00e9 Clair ,  Edmund Goulding ,  Frank Lloyd , Victor Saville and  Robert Stevenson . During the war the profits and salaries were given to war relief. After the war, prints were intended to be destroyed, so that no one could profit from them. However, this never occurred. [7] \n Back to Britain [ edit ] \n Returning to Britain, Neagle and Wilcox commenced with  They Flew Alone  (1942; shot after but released before  Forever and a Day ). Neagle this time played aviator  Amy Johnson , who had recently died in a flying accident.  Robert Newton 's co-starred as Johnson's husband, Jim Mollison. The film inter-cut the action with newsreel footage. [7] \n Neagle and Wilcox married in August 1943 at the  Caxton Hall . [10] \n They continued with  The Yellow Canary  (1943), co-starring  Richard Greene  and  Margaret Rutherford . In this spy story, Neagle plays a German-sympathiser (or at least that is what she seems to be at first) who is forced to go to Canada for her own safety. In reality, of course, she's working as an  undercover agent  out to expose a plot to blow up  Halifax Harbour  in  Nova Scotia .  The Yellow Canary  received positive comment for its atmospheric recreation of wartime conditions. [5] \n In 1945 Neagle appeared on stage in  Emma , a dramatisation of  Jane Austen 's  novel . That same year she was seen in the film  I Live in Grosvenor Square , co-starring  Rex Harrison . She wanted Harrison for the lead in her next film,  Piccadilly Incident  (1946). However, he (as well as  John Mills ) proved to be unavailable at the time, so Wilcox cast  Michael Wilding  in the lead. Thus was born what film critic  Godfrey Winn  called \"the greatest team in British films\". [7]  The story \u2013 of a wife, presumed dead, returning to her (remarried) husband \u2013 bears a resemblance to the  Irene Dunne \u2013 Cary Grant  comedy  My Favorite Wife .  Piccadilly Incident  was chosen as  Picturegoer ' s Best Film of 1947. Despite the fact that Neagle was some 8 years senior to Wilding, they proved to be an extremely bankable romantic pairing at the British box office. By now in her mid-forties, Neagle continued to have success in youthful and romantic lead roles. \n Neagle and Wilding were reunited in  The Courtneys of Curzon Street  (1947), a period drama that became the year's top box-office attraction. The film featured Wilding as an upper-class dandy and Neagle as the maid he marries, only to have the two of them driven apart by  Victorian  society. [5] \n The third pairing of Neagle and Wilding in the \"London Films\", as the series of films came to be called, was in  Spring in Park Lane  (1948). A drama, this depicted the romance between a millionaire's niece and a footman (actually a nobleman who has seen better days). The script was written by  Nicholas Phipps , who also played Wilding's brother. Although not a musical, it contains a dream sequence featuring the song \"The Moment I Saw You\".  Spring in Park Lane  was the 1949  Picturegoer  winner for Best Film, Actor and Actress. [7]  Neagle and Wilding were together for a fourth time in the Technicolor romance  Maytime in Mayfair  (1949). The plot is reminiscent of  Roberta , as it had Wilding inheriting a dress shop owned by Neagle. [5] \n By now, Neagle was at her peak as Britain's top box-office actress, and she made what reputedly became her own favourite film,  Odette  (1950), co-starring  Trevor Howard ,  Peter Ustinov  and  Marius Goring . As  Odette Sansom , she was the  Anglo -French  resistance fighter  who was pushed to the edge of betrayal by the Nazis. [7]  In 1950, Neagle and Wilcox moved to the top floor flat in Aldford House overlooking Park Lane, which would be their home until 1964. [10]  She played  Florence Nightingale  in  The Lady with a Lamp  (1951), based on the 1929 play by  Reginald Berkeley . \n Returning to the stage in 1953, she scored a success with  The Glorious Days , which had a run of 476 performances. Neagle and Wilcox brought the play to the screen under the title  Lilacs in the Spring  (1954), co-starring  Errol Flynn . In the film she plays an actress knocked out by a bomb, who dreams she is  Queen Victoria  and  Nell Gwyn  \u2013 as well as her own mother. As she begins dreaming, the film switches from black-and-white to colour. In Britain, where Neagle had top billing, the film was reasonably successful. In the United States, however, where Flynn had top billing, the title was changed to  Let's Make Up , and it flopped, with limited bookings. [7] [11] \n On the wane [ edit ] \n Neagle and Flynn reteamed for a second film together,  King's Rhapsody  (1955), based on an  Ivor Novello   musical  and also starring  Patrice Wymore  (Flynn's wife at the time). Although Neagle performed several musical numbers for the film, most of them were cut from the final release, leaving her with essentially a supporting role. Shot in  Eastmancolor  and  CinemaScope  with location work near  Barcelona , Spain,  King's Rhapsody  was a major flop everywhere. Neagle's (and Flynn's) box-office appeal, it seemed, was fading. [12] \n Neagle's last box-office hit was  My Teenage Daughter  (1956), which featured her as a mother trying to prevent her daughter ( Sylvia Syms ) from lapsing into juvenile delinquency. [5] \n Neagle and Syms worked together again on  No Time For Tears  (1957), also starring  Anthony Quayle  and  Flora Robson . As directed by  Cyril Frankel , this was the first film for over 20 years where Neagle was directed by someone other than Herbert Wilcox. Set in a children's hospital, the film features Neagle as a matron dealing with the problems of the patients and the staff, notably a nurse (Syms) infatuated with one of the doctors ( George Baker ). [5] \n With her husband, Neagle began producing films starring  Frankie Vaughan , but these were out of touch with changing tastes, and lost money, resulting in Wilcox going heavily into debt. Neagle herself made her final film appearance in  The Lady Is a Square  (1957), also Wilcox's last film as director. \n Neagle was the subject of  This Is Your Life  on two occasions, in February 1958 when she was surprised by  Eamonn Andrews  at the BBC Television Theatre, and in March 1983, when Andrews surprised her at London's Royal National Hotel. \n Final years [ edit ] \n Herbert Wilcox was bankrupt by 1964, but his wife soon revived his fortunes. She returned to the stage the following year and made a comeback in the  West End  musical  Charlie Girl . In it she played the role of a former \"Cochran Young Lady\" who marries a peer of the realm.  Charlie Girl  was not a critical success, but it ran for six years and 2,047 performances. It earned Neagle an entry in the  Guinness Book of World Records  for her enduring popularity. [4] \n Two years after  Charlie Girl  \u2013 which she also performed in Australia and New Zealand \u2013 Neagle was asked to appear in a revival of  No, No, Nanette , at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, having appeared in the screen version three decades earlier. Later, in 1975, she replaced  Celia Johnson  in  The Dame of Sark  and, in 1978 (the year after her husband's death), she was acting in  Most Gracious Lady , which was written for the Silver Jubilee of  Queen Elizabeth II . [13] \nMemorial plaque to Anna Neagle in  St Paul's, Covent Garden \n Although affected by  Parkinson's disease  in her last years, Neagle continued to be active. She appeared in  Cameron Mackintosh 's revival of  My Fair Lady  and in 1985 she appeared as the Fairy Godmother in a production of  Cinderella  at the  London Palladium . [14] \nSome sources state that Neagle was suffering from cancer at the time of her death. She was interred alongside her husband in the  City of London Cemetery . [15]  Their grave was recommemorated by Princess Anne, the Princess Royal on 6 March 2014. \n A memorial plaque on her former home at Aldford House,  Park Lane  was unveiled on 30 May 1996, by  Princess Anne  and  Lana Morris . [10]  She also has a memorial plaque in  St Paul's Church , the Actors' Church in  Covent Garden . \n A street named in her honour, Anna Neagle Close, [16]  is situated in  Forest Gate , London. \n Awards [ edit ] \n Neagle was created a  Commander of the Order of the British Empire  (CBE) in the 1952 New Year Honours  [17]  and, for her contributions to the theatre, a  Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire  (DBE) in the 1969 Birthday Honours. \n Filmography [ edit ] \n The following list contains all of Neagle's acting credits in feature-length films with the exception of  Queen Victoria  (1942), which is actually a compilation of two earlier films,  Victoria the Great  and  Sixty Glorious Years . All of her films were directed by  Herbert Wilcox  and produced in the United Kingdom unless otherwise noted. \n In addition, Neagle also appeared briefly as herself in a documentary short entitled  The Volunteer  (1943), and served as narrator for the films  The Prams Break Through  (1945) and  Princess's Wedding Day  (1947). Neagle also produced, but did not appear in, three films starring  Frankie Vaughan :  These Dangerous Years  (1957),  Wonderful Things  (1957) and  The Heart of a Man  (1959). \n Year \n Title \n Role \n Notes \n 1929 \n Those Who Love \n Bit part  (uncredited) \n Directed by H.
