[1]  Mehfils are also an integral part of the  Hyderabadi Muslim  community, and used as a way of unity among them, all around the world. [2] \n Today they are generally held in the homes of especially avid music lovers or the lovers of poetry-recitation gatherings.  Ghazals  are a common genre performed at  mehfil s. Ghazal recitation gatherings are called 'Mehfil-e-Mushaira' in the  Urdu  language. \n Contents \n 1   Etymology \n 2   Popular culture \n 3   See also \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n Etymology [ edit ] \n The word  mehfil  derives from the  Arabic  word  mehfil  ( Arabic :  \u0645\u062d\u0641\u0644 \u200e), which means a (festive) \"gathering to entertain (or praise someone).\" \n Mehfil-e-Naat  is an Islamic  mehfil  (forum) in which people sit and recite poetry in the praise of the  Prophet Muhammad . \n Mehfil-e-Sama  is a gathering held for  Sufi   devotional music  such as  Qawwali  or prayer and chanting,  Hadhra , part of  Dhikr  (remembrance of God). \n Popular culture [ edit ] \n Several  mehfil  performances may be seen in the  Satyajit Ray  film  Jalsaghar  (1958).
