Create new syntheses of knowledge and creation. These are the hallmarks of the Individualized Program (INDI). Many stellar researchers at Concordia are prepared to help you navigate new terrains of scholarship. We offer a heterogeneous community of over 100 like-minded students to welcome you into their fold. \n INDI was created by the\u00a0School of Graduate Studies\u00a0to provide space within the academy for a  limited number of exceptionally capable and prepared students  with specific research goals. An individualized program of study, INDI offers the possibility for research and graduate studies at both the  master\u2019s and doctoral levels  in areas not covered by existing graduate programs. \n INDI is designed to promote  innovative approaches to issues  outside the normal boundaries of research and creation of existing graduate programs\u00a0 \n INDI students engage in  individualized research initiatives  supported by integrated programs of study drawing on the various resources available both within and across Faculties at Concordia University. \n In most cases, if you apply to INDI, you must propose a program involving  multi- or interdisciplinary scholarship  on problems that are not normally the province of disciplinary programs at Concordia. \n Contact Us \n Individualized Programs \n School of Graduate Studies \n Individualized program Admission requirements Program requirements Supervisory committee Research currents News & events Archives Theses working titles Courses of interest Program Director & Committee Contact \n Back to top \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Concordia University  - Call us at 514-848-2424 \n About \n Academics \n Admissions \n Campus life \n Research \n International \n Future students \n Current students \n Alumni & friends \n Parents  \n Faculty & staff \n Media \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n facebook \n twitter \n google \n youtube \n linkedin \n pinterest \n instagram \n flickr \n Concordia social \n \u00a9 Concordia University \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n Website feedback \n Share this page \n Concordia.ca \n Call us at \n 514-848-2424 \n Sir George Williams Campus \n 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H3G 1M8 \n See SGW Campus map  \n Loyola Campus \n 7141 Sherbrooke Street W. \n Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada \n H4B 1R6 \n See Loyola Campus map  \n Website feedback \n Terms \n Privacy \n Accessibility \n \u00a9 Concordia University"}
